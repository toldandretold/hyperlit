The Red Thread
One red thread drawn from the great tangle of Marxist theory can guide us through
the labyrinth of high-technology capitalism. This strand, often severed and nearly lost, yet
constantly picked up by unlikely hands, goes by a variety of names. Because it traces the
conflict between exploiters and exploited, it is often called `class struggle' Marxism;
because it contrasts the vitality of living labour with the dead power of capitalist command
it is sometimes known as `subjectivist' Marxism; recently, something close to this tradition
has been termed `open' Marxism, because of it shows how the insurgencies of the
oppressed unseal fixed sociological categories and teleological certainties.1 But whatever
label is attached to it, the defining feature of this line of Marxism is its emphasis not just on
the dominative power of capital, but on people's capacity to contest that power.
 As James O'Connor reminds us, this is a Marxism that owes at least as much to the
passion of Romanticism as to the scientific Enlightenment.2 Theorists within this tradition
understand capital's crises as arising not from the "internal barriers" to capitalist
accumulation, but as a result of an "external barrier"--namely, the working class itself:
Their focus is the condition of availability of disciplined wage labour, or
capital's political and ideological capacity to impose wage labour on the
working class.3
This is therefore a Marxism which insists that struggle is intrinsic to the capital-relation. It
contrasts sharply with what Michael Lebowitz terms "one sided Marxism" that focuses on


128
the activity of capital and neglects the counter-activities of workers.4 Instead of seeing
history as the unfolding of pre-given, inevitable and objective laws, the class-struggle
tradition argues that such `laws' are no more than the outcome of two intersecting vectors--
exploitation, and its refusal in the constantly recurrent eruptions of fight and flight by which
rebellious subjects seek a way beyond work, wage and profit.
Clearly such a perspective has not been limited to any one group or particular
epoch. Rather, it constitutes a heretical strain within Marxism which time and again has
interrupted the hegemony of more mechanistic, objectivist and authoritarian versions, and,
as often, been savagely extinguished. Such an intermittent and subterranean existence makes
construction of a coherent lineage difficult--more a listing of outbreaks than a narrative of
continuities. A fragmentary chronology would of course start with passages from the
multiplicitous works of Marx and Engels. From the early 20th century, it would include
certain currents within council communism and anarcho-communism, as well as moments
in the work of Rosa Luxemburg and the early writings of Gyorgy Lukacs, Karl Korsch and
Antonio Gramsci.5 Later, in the 1930s and 40s it finds another manifestation in the work of
CLR James, Raya Duneyeskava, Martin Glaberman, George Rawick and others associated
with the Johnson-Forest tendency in the USA.6 In the wave of activism of the 1960s and
70s, the incidence of this kind of Marxism intensifies, including in France the activities of
groups such as "Socialisme ou Barbarie"7; in England, the work of EP Thompson and other
radical historians investigated the "making" of class through struggle8; in Germany, Karl
Heinz Roth's analysis of the `others worker movement'9; and also various groups associated
with the Italian ultra-left, to whose contribution I return in a moment. In my view there are
broad thematic affinities amongst these authors and activists--similarities in their emphasis


129
on agency, on struggle, on self-organisation and in their repudiation of authoritarian state
socialism--that warrant clustering them together.
 But can this lineage yield much that is new or even relevant to the analysis of high-
technology capitalism? Many of its makers lived and fought in a world that, though all-too
familiar with the capitalism's command of machinery, is separated from ours by several
generations of technological change--the world of the assembly line and telegraph, rather
than the robot and Internet. Even amongst those closer to our times, the greatest analytic
achievements are often historical and retrospective: Thompson's account of the factory-
system or James discussion of the slave-plantation, while provocative in their insights
about the intertwining of technology, work and power, do not speak directly to a world
saturated with computers, telecommunications and biotechnologies. 10 Moreover, it might
be said, while there are some studies of working class battles over digital machines and
electronic media from a class struggle position, these have usually not offered any
theoretical perspectives beyond the neo-Luddism discussed in the previous chapter.11 I
would argue, however, that there is a branch of this tradition whose currency and
inventiveness on issues of high technology struggle escapes such objections—the branch
often called "autonomist Marxism."12
As described by its main English language archivist and chronicler, Harry Cleaver,
autonomist Marxism has a genealogy that is deep and wide, stretching out to touch several
of the figures I have already mentioned.13 But of particular centrality is a cluster of
theorists associated with the "autonomia" movement of Italian workers, students and
feminists of the 1960s and 70s, including Raniero Panzieri, Mario Tronti, Sergio Bologna,
Romano Alquati, Mariarosa Dalla Costa, Francois Berardi, and Antonio Negri.14 In the late


130
1970s, autonomia was destroyed in one of the most ferocious yet least-known episodes of
political repression in the recent history of metropolitan capital. The work of this group of
intellectual-activists was violently interrupted by exile and imprisonment. Their brand of
Marxism, anathema to neoliberals, Eurocommunists and social democrats alike, came to
constitute a largely clandestine tradition.15 Yet over the political winter of the 1980s and
90s it has continued to develop, undergoing new mutations and making fresh international
connections.16 At a moment when all the accepted verities of the left are in confusion,
heresy can make a regenerative contribution. Transgressing the conventional limits of
Marxist thought, but built on the foundations of Marx's work and extending it into the
contemporary world, autonomist Marxism proposes not an `ex-Marxism' or a `post-
Marxism' but a "Marx beyond Marx."17
To pit autonomist Marxism against information revolutionaries is no arbitrary
juxtaposition. Groups within the orbit of autonomia were among the first to analyse the
post-industrial restructuring of capital as a weapon aimed against social dissent. Since that
time certain autonomist theorists, most notably Negri, have devoted increasing attention to
the vast new informational apparatus of contemporary capitalism. What makes their
perspective peculiarly notable is that it grasps the new forms of knowledge and
communication not only as instruments of capitalist domination, but also as potential
resources of anti-capitalist struggle. While autonomists are by no means alone in raising
these possibilities, the inventiveness and scope of their analysis has been massively
overlooked.
I therefore read autonomist Marxism (and it is worth emphasising that this is indeed
a reading of the autonomists' work, just as theirs is an active, inventive reading of Marx) as


131
a subversive counter-interpretation of the information revolution, contributing to the
reconstruction of a twenty-first century communism capable of confronting computerised
capitalism with a radically alternative vision of community and communication. This
chapter outlines some basic autonomist concepts, and then suggests how they open a way to
understand the information revolution as a moment in an ongoing cycle of struggles.
 The Perspective of Autonomy
At the heart of autonomist analysis lies Marx's familiar analysis of the relation
between labour and capital: a relation of exploitation in which workers, separated from the
means of production, are compelled to sell the living labour power from which the
capitalist extracts surplus value. In elaborating this account, however, most Western
Marxisms have tended to emphasise only the dominant and inexorable logic of capital, to a
degree such that its accumulative logic, unfolding according to ineluctable (even if finally
self-destructive) laws, figures as the unilateral force shaping the contemporary world. The
autonomists' re-discovery--startling enough that Yves Moulier terms it a "Copernican
inversion" in post-war Marxism--was that Marx's analysis affirms the power, not of
capital, but of the creative human energy Marx called "labour"--"the living, form-giving
flame" constitutive of society.18
 As Tronti put it:
We too have worked with a concept that puts capitalist development first,
and workers second. This is a mistake. And now we have to turn the
problem on its head, reverse the polarity, and start again from the
beginning: and that beginning is the class struggle of the working class.19


132
Far from being a passive object of capitalist designs, it is in fact the worker who is the
active subject of production, the wellspring of the skills, innovation and Cupertino on
which capital depends.20 Capital attempts to incorporate labour as an object, a component
in its cycle of value extraction, so much labour power. But this inclusion is always partial,
never fully achieved. Labouring subjects resist capital's reduction. Labour is for capital
always a problematic `other’ that must constantly be controlled and subdued, and that as
persistently, circumvents or challenges this command. Insofar as workers, rather than being
organised by capital, struggle against it, they constitute the working class.
This distinction between labour power and working class was originally Marx's.21
But by reviving it, the autonomists opened a way beyond the sterility of much subsequent
Marxist class analysis. For by saying that "the working class is defined by its struggle
against capital," they shrugged off elaborate taxonomies circumscribing the `real workers'
as some (usually diminishing) fraction of collective labour--manual, industrial, or `blue
collar.'22 Rather, they opened a perspective which could see tendencies to incorporation
within capital (as labour power) and independence from capital (as working class) as
opposite polarities or contending potentialities that permeate the entirety of capital's labour
force, understood in its broadest scope. In this view, working class struggles are the
insurgencies of subjects capital `classes' only as human resources against that
categorisation--what Cleaver has recently termed "struggles to cease being defined as
either a class or as a working class."23
To analyse such struggles autonomists use the concept of class composition.24 As
Cleaver points out, this is a striking instance of their "inversion" of classical Marxist


133
categories.25 Marx had referred to the way technological change results in a change in the
"composition of the collective labourer."26 But his original account of the "organic
composition" of capital focused on the power of capital to direct production through the
accumulation of machines. In autonomist theory, however, this emphasis is reversed: the
analysis of class composition is aimed at assessing the capacity of living labour to wrest
control away from capital.27 It starts from workers' struggles: how they arise, how they are
connected or divided, their relation or lack of relation to `official' workers' organisations,
and their capacity to subvert capitalist command.28 It measures the "level of needs and
desires"--expressed in political, cultural and social organisation--which constitute the
working class as what Negri terms a "dynamic subject, an antagonistic force tending
toward its own independent identity."29
Class composition is in constant change. If workers resisting capital compose
themselves as a collectivity, capital must strive to decompose or break up this threatening
cohesion. It does this by constant revolutionising of the means of production--by recurrent
restructurings, involving organisational changes and technological innovation that divide,
deskill or eliminate dangerous groups of workers. But since capital is a system that
depends on its power to organise labour through the wage, it cannot entirely destroy its
antagonist. Each capitalist restructuring must recruit new and different types of labour, and
thus yield the possibility of working class recomposition involving different strata of
workers with fresh capacities of resistance and counter-initiative.
The process of composition/ decomposition/ recomposition constitutes a cycle of
struggle.30 This concept is important because it permits recognition that from one cycle to
another the leading role of certain sectors of labour (say, the industrial proletariat), of


134
particular organisational strategies (say, the vanguard party), or specific cultural forms
(say, singing the Internationale) may decline, become archaic and be surpassed, without
equating such changes, as is so fashionable today, with the disappearance of class conflict.
Rather than being made once-over, the working class is, as Negri puts it, perpetually
"remaking" itself again and again in a movement of constant transformation.31
Indeed, in a crucial autonomist formulation, Tronti suggested that it is actually
workers' struggles that provide the dynamic of capitalist development. In Capital Marx had
observed that the initial impetus for capital's intensifying use of industrial machinery came
from proletarian movements demanding the shortening of the working day. Building on this,
the autonomists argued that capital does not unfold according to a self-contained logic,
spinning new technologies and organisations out of its own body. Rather, it is driven by the
need to forestall, coopt and defeat the `other' that is simultaneously indispensable and
inimical to its existence, fleeing forward into the future in what Tronti termed "successive
attempts of the capitalist class to emancipate itself from the working class."32
In this process capital is driven to successively wider and deeper dimensions of
control--toward the creation of a social factory. Marx had written of capital's tendency to
"subsume" not only the workplace but also society as a whole into its processes.33
Extending this analysis Tronti, writing in the 1960s, argued that capital's growing resort to
state intervention and technocratic control had created a situation where "the entire society
now functions as a moment of production."34 To understand these conditions required
moving away from the traditional Marxist focus on the immediate point of production
(usually the factory) towards the wider perspective suggested by Marx when he wrote of


135
capital as a circuit comprising not only the moment of production but also of distribution
and consumption.
This concept was then elaborated by the feminist wing of autonomist Marxism.
Mariarosa Dalla Costa and Selma James, anticipating themes now popular in feminist
political economy, argued that within the social factory, the reproduction of labour power
occupied a crucial but unacknowledged role.35 Without the--to male theorists--invisible
labour process of child-bearing, child-raising, cooking, shopping, education, cleaning,
caring for the sick, emotional sustenance, in short, `housework,' labour power would not be
ready for work each morning. This vital reproductive labour, traditionally female and
"unwaged," was subordinated to the traditionally male breadwinner.36 Thus the wage,
mediated by patriarchal authority, commanded and disguised unpaid labour time not only in
the workplace but also outside it. Other autonomist theorists applied broadly analogous
analysis to the situation of other unwaged groups--e.g. students, or, in an international
context, peasants--within the social factory.
In developing this analysis, Dalla Costa, James and other autonomists emphasised
that the potential unification of workers produced by the universalising logic of capital has
to be understood as cross-cut by a contrary tendency, which Marx recognised, but did not
analyse so deeply--namely capital's drive to divide workers along lines of nationality,
gender and race. As James puts it "In capital's hands, the division of labour is first and
foremost the division of labourers, on an international scale."37 This systemic organisation
of "difference as division" was imperative for capital, precisely in order to forestall the
unified class movement Marx predicted.38 Therefore anti-capitalist movements, rather than
simply mobilising a unity pre-given by the structure of production, faced the far more


136
complex task of organising across difference in order to challenge a capitalist totality
founded on fragmentation and division.
By extending the analysis of class composition to include reproductive as well as
productive labour, and unwaged as well as waged work, autonomists opened up Marxism
to radically new theoretical and organisational horizons. For, unlike the Frankfurt School
theorists, they did not find the scope of the social factory grounds for despair. If capitalist
production now requires an entire network of social relations, these constitute so many
more points where its operations can be ruptured. However, autonomists recognised that
all of these involved different subjects (factory workers, students, housewives) with
specific demands and organisational forms. No longer was the undermining of capitalism
the operation of Marx's singular "mole" --the industrial proletariat--but rather of what
Sergio Bologna termed a "tribe of moles."39 The `autonomy' of autonomist Marxism thus
came to affirm both labour's fundamental otherness from capital, and also the recognition of
variety within labour. This in turn leads away from vanguardist, centralised organisation,
directed from above, toward lateral, polycentric concept of anti-capitalist alliances-in-
diversity, connecting a plurality of agencies in a circulation of struggles.
Autonomist Marxism thus sees class conflict moving in what Tronti termed a
spiralling "double helix."40 Working class composition and capitalist restructuring chase
each other over ever widening and more complex expanses of social territory. As long as
capital retains the initiative, it can actually harness the momentum of struggle as a motor of
development, using workers' revolts to propel its growth and drive it to successively more
sophisticated technical and organisational levels. The revolutionary counter project,
however, is to rupture this recuperative movement, unspring the dialectical spiral, and


137
speed the circulation of struggles until they attain an escape velocity in which labour tears
itself away from incorporation within capital--in a process which autonomists refer to as
autovalorisation or self valorisation.41 For behind the perennially renewed conflict of
capital and labour lies an asymmetry of enormous consequence. Capital, a relation of
general commodification predicated on the wage relation, needs labour. But labour does
not need capital. Labour can dispense with the wage, and with capitalism, and find
different ways to organise its own creative energies: it is potentially autonomous.
The autonomist tradition has more often been stigmatised and ignored than given
rigorous theoretical examination. But some significant criticisms have been made. Werner
Bonefeld, while praising autonomists for breaking with the rigid stasis of structuralist
Marxism, suggests that their emphasis on the potential independence of labour from capital
can result in a tendency to present workers' as entirely external to capital--a sort of pure,
uncontaminated revolutionary force.42 Although this is not the case with the best of
autonomist analysis, which clearly depicts such struggles as occurring both in and against
capital, it undoubtedly can manifest in a certain romanticism that underestimates the depths
and pervasiveness of hierarchical divisions and ideological assimilation within the
working class, and sees every rebellious swallow as a spring of revolution.
Other critics have suggested that the autonomists' focus on the capital/labour
contradiction ignores the competitive conflicts and fractures within capital itself.43 Within
autonomist writing one certainly finds relatively little discussion of the rivalries between
different sectors of the ruling class, or of the divergence in immediate aims that can occur
between sectors such as, say, financial and industrial capital. Moreover, some autonomist
analysis seems to suggest that corporate power operates with a single, consciously


138
masterminded battle-plan. High levels of planning by transnational organisations such as
the IMF and G7 can make it appropriate to speak of such a capitalist 'strategy.’ But often
the anonymous and aggregated nature of the world-market's operations make a more
impersonal and less intentional term, such as "the logic of capital" used by Michael
Lebowitz, preferable.44
The autonomist emphasis on capital as a totality with certain over-riding systemic
imperatives is, however, consonant with the approach of Marx himself, who always
emphasised the importance of understanding "capital as a whole" before analysing the
activity of "individual capitals." And this is the only way to perceive what is really at stake
in the war against class: people’s attempt free themselves from a structure of alienated and
ultimately quite inhuman power, a process-without-a-subject-but-with-a-purpose, to whose
relentless accumulative drive individual capitalists, with all their smart manoeuvres and
internecine squabbles, are merely petty functionaries.
Interweaving Technology and Power
Autonomist analysis understands capitalism as a collision between two opposing
vectors--capital's exploitation of labour and worker's resistance to that exploitation. Its
perspective on technology, correspondingly, has two aspects. The first is an analysis of
technoscience as an instrument of capitalist domination--a rereading aimed at shattering
scientific socialism's myth of automatic scientific progress. The second, however, looks at
the situation from the other side, and analyses the ways in which struggles against class can
overcome capital's technological control.


139
In an early essay that established the direction for later autonomist critique,
Panzieri broke decisively with left views of technoscientific development as `progress.'45
Rather, returning to the pages in Capital on the early introduction of machinery, he re-
proposed that capitalism resorts to incessant technological renovation as a "weapon"
against the working class: its tendency to increase the proportion of dead or `constant'
capital as against living or `variable' capital involved in the production process arises
precisely from the fact that the latter is a potentially insurgent element with which
management is locked in battle and which must at every turn be controlled, fragmented,
reduced or ultimately eliminated.46
Faced with "capital's interweaving of technology and power," simply to
ratify technological rationalisation as a linear, universal advance--as the dominant forms of
official, Soviet -influenced Marxism did--was to ignore that what it consolidated was a
specifically capitalist rationality aiming at the domination of labour.47 To believe that the
relations of production (property relations) were simply a "sheathing" which would fall
away once the forces of production had been sufficiently expanded was an illusion.48 There
could, Panzieri concluded, be no question of assuming that socialism would arrive as a by-
product of scientific advance: emancipatory uses of machines were possible, but only to
the degree that working class revolt assumed a "wholly subversive character."49
Panzieri's perspective was formed in the industrial factory, witnessing the
way the Taylorist division of labour and Fordist automation were used to break down
worker solidarity. But his analysis of technology as capitalist weaponry has subsequently
been applied to situations not only of waged but unwaged labour. Thus, for example, Harry
Cleaver has analysed the so-called Green Revolution as capitalist counter-revolutionary


140
strategy.50 In the context of widespread communist insurgency in Asia, Cleaver argues, the
sponsorship by U.S. development agencies of new plant stocks and agricultural techniques
was aimed primarily at breaking down the traditional village structures. This had a two
fold aim--to eliminate the communities within which guerrillas moved like fish in the sea,
and to allow the creation of an industrial proletariat, fed off the countryside, a prerequisite
for capitalist modernisation. Agricultural technology served as the civil side to counter-
insurgency warfare.
However, autonomists also emphasise that waged and unwaged workers are
not just passive victims of technological change, but active agents who persistently contest
capital's attempts at control. This contestation can take two forms.51 The first is sheer
refusal. This is the theme of the most famous, and most reviled, of autonomist texts, Negri's
Domination and Sabotage.52 Writing in the context of the Italian industrial struggles of 70s
in the giant Fiat plants and elsewhere, Negri proposes that, confronting the introduction of
huge systems of semi-automated technological control, there could be no question of
accepting the necessity of modernisation, as official trades unions insisted. Instead,
workers should stop the innovations used against them--if necessary, by sabotage.53 This
emphasis on the possibilities of sabotage is an important part of the autonomist tradition,
and puts them close to the neo-Luddite authors discussed in the last chapter, some of whom
in fact draw on their work.54
However, there is another side to the autonomist analysis that gives it a
greater dynamism than outright neo-Luddism. This aspect (which Negri develops in his
later work) affirms the possibility for workers to use their "invention power"--the creative
capacity on which capital in fact depends for its incessant innovation--in order to


141
reappropriate technology. This possibility arises because, in its attempt to technologically
control labour, capital cannot avoid creating new types of technologically capable,
scientifically literate workers. As Cleaver observes, "The struggles of these workers vis-à-
vis their own working conditions as well as vis-à-vis larger social issues can . . . constitute
a serious obstacle to successful capitalist planning."55
An early instance of this line of thought can be found in the work of Francois
Berardi--an activist in the network of politicised `pirate' radio stations that played a
crucial role in the Italian autonomia movement.56 Berardi argued that in the course of
developing the "technoscientific intelligence" it needed for the control of living labour,
capital was unavoidably creating an increasingly "intellectual" workforce.57 With the
appearance of this new, scientific form of labour power also emerged the possibility of a
"worker's use of science" that would transform machinery from an "instrument of control
and intensification of exploitation into an instrument of liberation from work."58 This
manifested in two ways: in workers' insistence on claiming as their own the surplus time
created by automation, and in the increasing popular capacity to reappropriate
communication technologies, "subverting the instruments of information" and "reversing the
cycle of information into a collective organisation of knowledge and language."59
Resistance and reappropriation, sabotage and invention power, are, in autonomist
analysis, both parts of the repertoire of struggle--although different authors, at different
times and contexts, may put more emphasis on one than another. Unlike scientific socialists,
autonomists find no inherently progressive logic in technological development. But unlike
neo-Luddites they do not perceive only a monolithic capitalist control over scientific
innovation. Rather, their insistence on the perpetually contested nature of the labour-capital


142
relation and the basic independence of human creativity tends away from attribution of
fixed political valencies to machinery and towards a focus on possibilities for counter-
appropriation, refunctioning, and "detournement."60 If machinery is a "weapon" then it can,
as Cleaver says, be stolen or captured, "used against us or by us."61 Or--to use Panzieri's
perhaps richer and less instrumental metaphor--if capital "interweaves" technology and
power, then this weaving can be undone, and the threads used to make a different pattern.
This need not imply a crude `use and abuse' concept of technology of the sort that
neo-Luddites have rightly criticised. We can accept that machines are stamped with social
purposes without accepting the idea that all of them are so deeply implanted with the
dominative logic of capital as to be rejected. For if the capital relation is to its very core
one of conflict and contradiction, with managerial control constantly being challenged by
counter-movements to which it must respond, then this conflictual logic may enter into the
very creation of technologies.
Thus, for example, automating machinery can be understood as imprinted both with
the capitalist's drive to deskill and control workers, and also with labour's desire for
freedom from work--to which capital must respond by technological advance. Similarly,
communication technologies have often--as in the case of radio and computer networks--
evolved in the course of very complex interaction between business's drive to extend
commodification and democratic aspirations for free and universal of communication.
Along the way communication technologies have been shaped by both forces. This is not to
say that technologies are neutral, but rather that they are often constituted by contending
pressures that implant in them contradictory potentialities: which of these are realised is
something that will only be determined in further struggle and conflict.62


143
In the very course of class conflict, workers will not only, repeatedly, halt and
sabotage machines, but also challenge capital's unilateral ability to implant its logic in
technology--and instead bend, twist and even detach part of the process of technological
development to move it in quite different directions. Instead of understanding Marx's
`negative' and `positive' visions of machine-use in a linear, before-and-after progression--
with the same machines that were repressive before communism becoming magically
emancipatory afterward--autonomist analysis allows us to reconceive the process of
deconstructing and reconstructing technologies as itself part of the movement of the struggle
against capital.
From the Professional Worker to the Crisis of the Social Factory
To understand these ideas more concretely, however, we need to look at the three
major cycles of struggle which autonomists identify in the twentieth century: those of the
professional worker, the mass worker and--at least by some accounts--the socialised
worker. Such a sweeping account will necessarily be highly schematic. As Moulier has
emphasised, sensitive use of the cycles of struggle concept demands allowance for
unevenness, overlap, regional and national variation, and so on.63 Nonetheless, the very
broad-brush version offered here does provide the framework for an analysis of the
information revolution that situates it not as the product of ineluctable scientific progress,
but of social conflict. In order to clarify this overall dynamic I will proceed through all
three of the cycles, moving swiftly at first, but then deepening the analysis as we approach
the more recent periods.


144
The era of the professional worker--or what might more generally be recognised as
the craft worker--is regarded by autonomists as running from the mid-19th century to World
War I. It is so termed because of the strategic position occupied by skilled workers, now
absorbed within a mechanised factory system but still in possession of craft knowledges
and technical competencies. Such workers are the main protagonists in struggles focused
on control of the production process and the preservation of the dignity and value of work.
Outside of the factory, capital's subsumption of society remains relatively rudimentary. The
state's activity, other than in projects of imperial expansion, is generally limited to policing
the operation of the free market, which is characterised by disastrous economic cycles of
boom and bust arising from the difficulties of co-ordinating production and consumption.
Socialist programs in this period are built around the concept of worker's
management of industrial production. The role of productive factory labour as the agent of
emancipation is unquestioned. Left parties tend to reflect the technical composition of the
professional worker insofar as they have a mass membership but an avant-garde
leadership--trained cadres of political `experts.' Revolutionary organisations constructed
on this basis include not only the Leninist parties but also council communist movements
based largely amongst skilled technical workers--such as those of the German metal
industries.64 In the first quarter of the 20th century such organisations present a mounting
threat to capital. With the victory in 1917 of the Bolshevik vanguard party, this threat
seems about to attain catastrophic dimensions.
To save itself, capital undertakes a drastic organisational and technological
restructuring. This is aimed at decomposing working class power, by destroying the
technical base of the professional workers' power and cutting them off from the growing


145
mass of industrial labour. On the shopfloor the chronometer and the clipboard of Taylorist
scientific management are deployed to break craft worker's control of production. This
deskilling, at first attempted primarily through organisational innovation, is subsequently
mechanically embedded in the Fordist assembly line. At the same time, in the face of the
socialist threat, the first tentative steps are taken toward a more interventionist role for
government in social and economic affairs, aimed at stabilising business cycles and
pacifying unrest.
However, this restructuring unintentionally forges the matrix for the emergence of a
new working class subject--the mass worker. The Fordist factory--typified by the huge auto
plants which come to form the hub of the advanced economies--spatially concentrates huge
bodies of dequalified labour subjected to the brutality of continuous automated machine
pacing. In doing so, it creates the conditions for an unprecedented form of class solidarity.
With craft skills increasingly eroded by Taylorism, the mass worker fights not to uphold
the dignity of a trade, but to make capital pay for lives vanishing meaninglessly down the
assembly line. No longer able to control production, he can still stop it. The vulnerability
of the assembly line to interruption and sabotage, and the cost to management of idling the
increasingly expensive accumulation of fixed capital provide the points of attack. In a cycle
of struggle that finds its paradigmatic North American moments in the 1937 Flint sit-down
strikes, the mass worker finds increasingly effective ways of converting the mechanised
factory into a bastion of resistance.
To contain this new working class strength, capital is forced to further innovation.
Here the productivity deal, in which management maintains shopfloor control by
negotiating with trades unions regular pay raises tied to increases in output, becomes a


146
crucial factor. Although initially only grudgingly concede, this arrangement was eventually
assimilated by business as a way of harnessing working class strength to accumulation. The
link between productivity and pay served to both propel technological innovation and
pacify worker resistance. Alongside this institutionalisation of `industrial relations' emerge
ever more comprehensive plans of social management. Again as a result of working class
struggle, the factory wage is increasingly supplemented by a social wage of state-
controlled payments and amenities--welfare, unemployment, pensions, health insurance,
and medical, educational, and recreational facilities. And again capital recuperates these
concessions within a new structure of accumulation, as a means to forestall social
discontent and guarantee the markets for the volume of commodities pouring off the
mechanised lines.65Out of this complex interaction of opposition and incorporation there
gradually comes into being what the autonomists know as the Planner State, in which
government supports capitalist activity through Keynesian economics and welfare
programs.66
 As John Merrington has noted, autonomists never understood the era of the mass
worker as simply a `factory' phenomenon.67 Rather, they saw it as the moment of emergence
of the social factory. Capitalist organisation now requires the synchronisation of the
factory, where surplus value is pumped out on the assembly line, with the household,
where the punishing force of such work is repaired, displaced and hidden, and the pay
packet translated into purchases of standardised domestic goods. The gendered division of
labour and the pairing the male mass worker--whose life is to be slowly obliterated on the
assembly line--with the female housewife, whose lot is to tend the wounds, take the abuse,
do the shopping and raise the next generation of labour power in the isolation of the home--

becomes a conscious concern of capital's social managers.68 The labour of the female
housewife, whose `consumerist' schedule is organised largely through new organs of mass
communication, such as radio and television, starts to become as much the object of a
corporate planning as the productivity of her male partner on the shopfloor--for it is
through her activity that the pay increases won by the mass worker are translated into the
consumption necessary for a virtuous cycle of continual capitalist growth and stability.
At the end of the Second World War, it seems as if capital in North America and
Europe has successfully stabilised itself. The threatening presence of the mass worker is
contained in management-union deals, subjected to an increasing weight of mechanical
control, and kept ready for work by female reproductive labour in the home. Ethnic
minorities and immigrants provide a reserve army available for jobs outside the large
scale industry or in its most antiquated, dangerous sectors. Young people are processed
through an expanding educational system that sorts and trains personnel for the increasingly
elaborate techno-administrative apparatus required by the Planner State and ever more
mechanised production. The threat of the Soviet Union, now turned under Stalin into a
ghastly caricature of revolution, is cordoned off with nuclear weapons and a perpetual
state of war-readiness. On the basis of this carefully segmented but society-wide
mobilisation, capital secures its golden age of uninterrupted growth.
But then things start to come apart. In the inhuman conditions of the assembly-line
factory, the productivity deal always rested on a razor-thin balancing of capitalist profits
and worker anger. In the mid-60s the tightrope trembles. Mass workers increasingly refuse
to restrain wage demands within limits functional to capitalist growth or to tolerate
conditions accepted by their unions. Management responds to wage pressures with attempts


148
to intensify the pace and intensity of work, thereby precipitating further resistance. A wave
of wildcat strikes, slowdowns, sabotage, and absenteeism--which the autonomists christen
"the refusal of work"--sweeps across Europe and North America, concentrated initially in
the crucial automobile plants, but spreading to other sectors, rendering factories from
Detroit to Turin to Dagenham virtually unmanageable.69
Even more alarming for capital, these industrial conflicts start to reverberate with
problems elsewhere in the social factory. Students who have flooded the universities to
escape a destiny as line workers or housewives refuse to confine their intellectual
activities within the limits of the `knowledge factory' and burst into campus revolt. Black
and immigrant communities explode against their situation as ghettoised reservoirs of
cheap labour. Women, who had in increasing numbers already been abandoning their
designated household role to seek paid work, begin a new wave of feminist rebellion
against domestic subordination. All these outbreaks are in turn coloured by the unexpected
challenges in Vietnam and Cuba to advanced capital's global dominance which generate
powerful anti-war and international solidarity movements.
Understood in the light of autonomist analysis, these diverse eruptions, while
distinct, are not disconnected. Rather, they appear as a broad revolt by different sectors of
labour against their allotted place in the social factory. The new social movements of the
era can be understood not as a negation of working class struggle, but as its blossoming: an
enormous exfoliation, diversification and multiplication of demands, created by the revolt
of previously subordinated and super-exploited sectors of labour. The swirling social
ferment which results certainly involve struggles within and amongst labour, as those
sectors at the bottom of the wage hierarchy--unpaid women, unemployed minorities--assert


149
their equality with those above them--usually white, male, unionised labour. But they also
involve a destabilisation of the entire capitalist organisation of society as a mechanism of
surplus extraction.
Complex ricochet effects come into play as demands for improvement in the social
wage threaten corporations with higher tax levels and diminished profits, thereby
intensifying conflicts over the factory wage. Even more alarming for capital, the multiple
outbreaks of dissent begin to be consciously linked with or inspired by one another--as in
the interaction of students and workers that occurs briefly in Paris in 1968 and over a
longer period of time in Italy; the meeting of labour and anti-racist struggles in Detroit and
elsewhere; or the rekindling of feminism out of the civil rights and student movements. The
result is a circulation of struggles which starts, at multiple points, to threaten the whole
intricate balance of the social factory.
Imposing Cybernetic Command
The response can only be counterattack. In a shift which is usually identified with
Reaganism and Thatcherism but whose origins the autonomists date back to the early
1970s, capital begin another drastic restructuring.70 In the realm of government, the
"Planner State" is replaced by the "Crisis State"--a regime of control by trauma in which
"it is the state that plans the crisis."71 Keynesian guarantees are dismantled in favour of
discipline by restraint; unions hamstrung by changes in labour law; monetary policies
exercised to drive real wages down and unemployment up; and welfare programs brought
under attack. At the same time, corporate managers take aim at the industrial centres of
turbulence, decimating the factory base of the mass worker by the automation and


150
globalisation of manufacturing. Dismantling the Fordist organisation of the social factory,
capital launches into its post-Fordist phase--a project, which however, must be understood
as a technological and political offensive aimed at decomposing social insubordination.
It is in the context of this offensive restructuring that the work of the `information
revolutionaries' can be situated. As we saw in Chapter 2, the first formulations of post-
industrial theory by Bell, Drucker, Brzezinski and Kahn--intellectuals closely affiliated to
the nexus of state and corporate power in the most powerful capitalist centres--
corresponds precisely to this moment. At that time, George Caffentzis, writing of the
apocalyptic calls for a "complete change in the mode of production" issuing from such
theorists, observed:
They are "revolutionaries" because they fear something in the present mode
that disintegrates capital's touch: a demand, an activity and a refusal that has
not been encompassed.72
The post-industrialists' futurological reports thus fall into place alongside the infamous
report by Samuel Huntington and others on the "excess of democracy" as part of capital’s
assessment of what is required to reassert command of a deteriorating situation.73 In the
name of irresistible progress and objective prediction, the information theorists propose a
program and a legitimisation for a great technological deployment whose glittering sheen
disguises old and cold objectives: annihilation of the bases of working class power,
reduction of wages and social wages, restoration of social discipline.


151
For Collettivo Strategie, a group within the orbit of autonomia, what the new
informational doctrines demonstrated was "a militant and revolutionary behaviour on the
part of capitalism."74 Analysing the projection by Zbgniew Brzezinski--President Carter's
US National Security Advisor and a founding member of the Trilateral Commission--of an
imminent "technetronic revolution" based on "new technologies, new sciences,
microelectronic computers and new means of communication" it noted:
This process is nothing other than a confirmation of the power of capital, as
Marx asserted, to impose itself as a force which changes technology or
which strikes it down and destroys it violently, thus revealing itself as the
least conservative force possible . . .75
In fact, Collettivo suggested, the emergence of eminent state officials such as Brzezinski
from the culture of think tanks and futurological research institutes indicated that capital
had gone "Leninist."76 Just as the socialist vanguard party was the "organised and
theoretical form for seizing power" so,
. . . in the same way capital tries to organise its vanguards into institutions
which take the form of a party oriented not toward the destruction but rather
the maintenance of power.77


152
The project of these informational "vanguards" of capital was a reorganisation of
production based on "new models of universal communication," launching a new phase of
development characterised by the "creation of uomini merce (humans who have become
commodities)" subject to manipulation through " control over the flows of information"--a
project Collettivo referred to as the imposition of "cybernetic command."78
The military metaphor should not be taken lightly. For what occurs from the mid
1970s onward is that computer and telecommunications devices, developed since the end
of World War II primarily as military instruments for the containment of international
communism, are transferred for internal application as the 'command, control,
communications and intelligence' system for the reestablishment of capitalist discipline and
productivity. In a classic instance of what Paul Virilio terms "endocolonisation," the
security apparatus, nominally facing outward to defeat external foes, is turned against the
`enemy within.'79 In the United States, a boosting in Pentagon funding, which eventually
culminates in the gargantuan Star Wars project, is central to generally speeding the rate of
informatic research and development, and, in some cases, to highly specific injections of
new technology into the war against labour. The US Air Force, for example, plays a central
role in fostering the computerised automation systems aimed at achieving a workerless
factory.80
Electronic networking, originally developed as part of nuclear war fighting
preparation, receives its first large-scale civilian application in the emergency management
systems used by the Nixon administration to monitor its wage-price freeze and picket line
violence in a truckers strike.81 More generally, there is an accelerated adoption by both the
corporate sector and the apparatus of government of technologies previously nurtured by


153
the military in its quest for battlefield control--microelectronics, computer mediated
communications, video recording, expert systems, artificial intelligence, robotics--now
adapted and diffused to provide a similar scope of overview and precision intervention in
the workplace and civil society.82
Thus the neoliberal transition from "welfare state to warfare state" is supported by
a whole new level of intensity and sophistication in the governmental use of information
technologies.83 Mass media and new communications techniques are deployed in depth to
measure, massage, poll and propagandise public opinion preparatory to policy change.
Computerisation automates and disperses state sector jobs, providing crucial leverage in
attacks on public service unions--such as the Reaganite assault on US air-traffic
controllers--and creating `lean' institutions attractive to privatisation. The same
technologies are applied to streamline social programs shaved to levels that monitor,
rather than support, and to scapegoat perpetrators of welfare fraud. Last, but by no means
least, informatics equips paramilitary security forces with a full arsenal of surveillance
devices, electronic intrusion measures, cross-referenced data banks and field
communications for a series of domestic `wars'--on terrorism, on crime, on drugs--which
beat down on civil disorders.
The aggressive use of informatics is even more pronounced in the corporate
restructuring of work. If the chronometer and the assembly line were the weapons of
managerial assault on the professional worker, the robot and the computer network play an
equivalent role in the attack on the mass worker. In manufacturing plants, factory wide
systems of computerised flow control--Flexible Manufacturing Cells (FMC), Flexible
Manufacturing System (FMS), Management Resource Planning (MRP), Computer Aided


154
Process Planning (CAPP) and Just-in-Time (JIT) systems--permit management to sever the
solidarity of the assembly line by cutting it into competing `work teams' supplied by robot
servers, shrinking the labour force, and in some cases approaching the `lights out' scenario
of fully automated factory production. The strategic advantage afforded capital by this
disaggregation and downsizing is then reinforced by telecommunications systems which
permit the centralised co-ordination of dispersed operations, making feasible the transfer
of work from hot-spots of instability either to domestic `greenfield' sites uncontaminated by
militancy or to offshore locations--the first steps toward what would soon be known as
`globalisation.'
On all these fronts the deployments of new information technologies and the
restructuring of capital converge so closely that neither is practically distinguishable from
the other.84  The effects on class composition are devastating. In a series of critical
industrial confrontations, informational innovations give capital a winning card, as Italian
car workers find their industrial strength destroyed by the total-automation systems of
Robogate and Digitron, British miners are undercut by the Minos robot drill, remnants of
craft work strength in London's printers unions are annihilated by computerised type
setting, and the striking clerical workers in the US health insurance industry find their
pickets lines overleaped by telematics.85 Such defeats set the scene for an overall
neoliberal attack not only on the wage but also on the social wage, realised through the
dismantling of the welfare state.
In the face of this attack, the other movements that had shaken the social factory in
the 60s and 70s are themselves increasingly thrown onto the defensive. The most militant--
like the Panthers in the US or autonomia in Italy--are destroyed by assassination,


155
imprisonment and direct repression. But others--such as the student movement--are sapped
by insecurity, lack of resources and time and confronted at every turn by the ideological
claims of restraint, globalisation and deficit reduction. In the face of cybernetic command,
the incipient circulation of struggles disintegrates into a series of atomised rearguard
actions.
The effects of this convulsion on Marxist thinking have been devastating. As
Caffentzis remarks, "The very image of the worker seems to disintegrate before this
recomposition of capital.86 As Fergus Murray argues, in an analysis drawing on autonomist
categories, extensive computerisation in the factory seems to mark a decisive "decline in
the mass collective worker."87 By permitting centrally controlled, comprehensive factory
automation and the splitting-up of the production cycle, management can now reduce and
disperse workers once concentrated together so they are "scattered territorially, socially
and culturally, in different conditions of work and often invisible from one another."88 In
such a situation, Murray observes, "the problem of uniting a single workforce, let alone the
class, is daunting."89 There is now widespread acceptance even on the left that aspirations
for proletarian autonomy have met a technological nemesis--that capital may indeed have
succeeded in achieving its age-old goal of emancipation from the working class.
Socialised Worker . . .?
To stop here, however, would be to omit the most provocative proposal in
autonomist thought. For some of its theorists suggest that out of capital's informational
restructuring is emerging the subject of a new cycle of revolutionary struggles: the


156
"socialised worker." This term, first used by Romano Alquati in his analysis of student
revolt in the 1970s, has been primarily associated with the work of Negri, who describes it
as "an innovation in the vocabulary of class concepts" attempting to express the transition
from,
that working class massified in direct production in the factory, to the social
labour-power, representing the potentiality of a new working class, now
extended through the entire span of production and reproduction--a
conception more adequate to the wider and more searching dimensions of
capitalist control over society and social labour as a whole.90
Over two and a half decades, from the time of Negri's involvement in the Italian struggles
to his exile in France, he has progressively deepened and amplified this idea.91
The socialised worker is, according to Negri, the subject of a productive process
that has become coextensive with society itself. In the era of the professional worker,
capital concentrates itself in the factory. In the era of the mass worker, the factory is made
the centre around which society revolves. But in the epoch of the socialised worker, the
factory is, with the indispensable aid of information technologies, disseminated out into
society, deterritorialising, dispersing and decentralising its operations to constitute what
some autonomists term the "diffuse factory" or the "factory without walls."92 "Work," says
Negri "abandons the factory in order to find in the social, a place adequate to the functions
of concentrating productive activity and transforming it into value.93


157
This diffusion of work unfolds through what he terms "flexibilisation, tertiarisation
and socialisation."94 As the traditional centres of production are automated, enterprises
reorganise around flexible models based upon a small core of permanent employees
surrounded by a periphery of contingent workers: part-time, temporary and casual work,
dependent subcontracting operations, `black' work, informal work, outwork and
teleworking proliferate. Wage labour is deconcentrated, spatially and temporally dispersed
throughout society, and interleaved with unpaid time in new and irregular rhythms.95
Simultaneously, as capital reduces its industrial workforce, it seeks out new
sources of labour in the so-called service or tertiary sector. This process embraces the
large-scale conversion of female domestic labour into fast food, homemaking, day-care,
health care, and surrogate motherhood businesses; an extraordinary diversification of
cultural industries, turning knowledge, aesthetics, and communications into materials for an
explosion of media, music, entertainment, advertising, and fashion industries; and an array
of other experiments from massage parlours to management consultancies. This expansion
of waged work marks a new order of magnitude in the commodification of human activity.
However, the most radical aspect of this socialisation of labour is the blurring of
waged and non-waged time. The activities of people not just as workers but as students,
consumers, shoppers and viewers are now directly integrated into the production process.
During the era of the mass worker, the consumption of commodities and the reproduction of
labour had been organised as spheres of activity adjunct to, yet distinct from, production.
Now these borders fray. In education, schooling is explicitly reconstituted as job training,
life-long learning as requalification for technological change, and universities as corporate
research facilities. In consumption, the integration of advertising, market research, point-


158
of-sale devices, just-in-time inventory control and flexible specialisation systems makes
the monitoring of the consumer as integral to the production cycle as that of the worker.
Work, school, and domesticity are re-formed into a single, integrated constellation
The world of the socialised worker is thus one where capital suffuses the entire
form of life. To be socialised is to be made productive, and to become a subject is to be
made subject to value--not only as an employee but as a parent, shopper and student, as a
flexibilised home worker, as an audience in communicative networks, indeed even as a
transmitter of genetic information. The demarcation between the production, circulation
and reproduction of capital is impeached in a "network of various, highly differentiated,
yet confluent mechanisms" which "mixes, in new and indefinite labour, all that is
potentially productive" so that "the whole of society is placed at the disposal of profit."96
"Productive labour," says Negri, "is now that which produces society."97
In this situation, where the spatial location of exploitation is no longer the factory
but the network and its temporal measure not the working day but the life-span, Negri
observes that we have indeed "gone beyond Marx."98 Marx's original concept of "real
subsumption," the swallowing of society by capital, has been realised and exceeded.
Indeed, says Negri, it is this apparent co-extensivity of capital with the social which
obscures the "contours of the totality," allowing business to "disguise its hegemony . . . and
its interest in exploitation, and thus pass its conquest off as being in the general interest."99
Facing such an expansion of capital's calculus beyond the point of production we might, he
says, now choose to speak of socialised labour power not as a worker but as an operator
or agent. Yet, by retaining the traditional Marxist epithet, he emphasises "an antagonism


159
which has never ceased to exist"--a conflict between the imperatives of capital and the
needs and desires of the subjects on whose activity it depends.100
For, Negri argues, this intensifying fusion of capital and society has unexpected
consequences. Capital `socialises' itself in order to escape the factory-centred conflicts
with the mass worker. But the exploitative relation from which that conflict arose--the
extraction of unpaid activity from labour--persists. Now, however, it radiates out to inform
the extended networks of social activity. Capital persists in paying only for a tiny segment
of the life activity it expropriates. But this logic manifests not only in roll-backs and speed-
ups on the shop floor, but in cut backs to the social wage, the erosion of the welfare state,
and the off-loading of the costs of environmental damage. These practices are of course not
new. But the intensified integration of capital's circuit sharply highlights the inadequacy of
the wage to acknowledge the web of relationships that sustain social production.
The result, Negri says, is that class struggle, transmuted but not eliminated,
reappears, refracted into a multiplicity of points of conflict. In a world where capital has
insinuated itself everywhere, there is now no central front of struggle, which instead snakes
through homes, schools, universities, hospitals, and media, and takes the form not only of
workplace strikes and confrontations, but also of resistance to the dismantling of the
welfare state, demands over pay equity, child care, parenting, and health care benefits, and
opposition to ecological despoliation. In the newly socialised space of capital, a fractal
logic obtains, such that each apparently independent location replicates the fundamental
antagonism that informs the entire structure--capital's insistence that life-time be
subordinated to profit.


160
 The crucial issue therefore becomes whether the scope of socialised labour will
manifest as division or alliance, segmentation or linkage. Negri observes that struggles by
multifarious subjects at the many sites of the factory without walls--factory workers,
welfare mothers, students--each manifest their own specificity, their own "concrete
autonomy."101 Yet all encounter a barrier in capitalism's subordination of every use value
to the universal logic of the market. Consequently,
It's either/or: either we accentuate the antagonisms and competitions in the
concrete cases or we construct a political and subjective totality dialectical
of these segmentations . . . All this finds its material base if, escaping the
myth of factory production you enter the truth of the process of social
production and reproduction, where the functions, the consumption, the
elements, the differentiation of the process are fundamental for its own
operation, that is for the operation of producing and circulating wealth.102
For Negri, the experimentation with coalitions, `coordinations,' `rainbows,' `rhizomes,'
`networks,' `hammocks,' and `webs' which has been a salient feature of anti-capitalist
movements in the last decade denotes the search for a politics adequate to "the specific
form of existence of the socialised worker," which " "is not something unitary, but
something manifold, not solitary, but polyvalent" and where "the productive nucleus of the
antagonism consists in multiplicity.103
The concept of the socialised worker is in fact a conjugation or synthesis of `old'
working class theory and analysis of `new' social movements.104 Negri argues that the new


161
subject arises at the intersection of "two fundamental axes."105 One of these runs "from
society toward the world of labour" and transmits into the workplace the concerns "of
feminism, of ecology, of young people, of anti-racist struggle, of social activism, and, in
general, a radical cultural modification and a perspective of irreducible grassroots
autonomy."106 The other runs "from the world of work to society" and carries with it not
only a critique of capitalist restructuring, of "exploitation aggravated and distributed
throughout the most diverse strata of society," but also a demand for increased power in the
shaping of the economic order.107 Out of the fusion of these currents appears the possibility
of a "reunification of the traditional components of the class struggle against exploitation
with the new liberation movements."108
Indeed, Negri argues that from the 1980s there have appeared the first signs of a
new cycle of struggles. Focusing mainly on the European context, he and his colleagues
look at a series of movements--amongst nurses, media workers, students--which have
challenged neoliberal restructuring. In particular, they have been inspired by the successive
waves of social revolt which have shaken French society, from the student protests of 1986
to the interlinked revolts of students, workers and immigrants in 1994 against proposals to
cut the minimum wage to young job entrants, to the massive three week strike wave of 1996
against the neoliberal Juppe plan. These movements of the socialised worker, Negri says,
take forms completely different from the factory struggles of the mass worker, and although
historically linked to the first appearance of the new social movements in the 1960s, they
are now entering an entirely new phase. This is characterised by:


162
. . . the radically democratic form of organisation, the transformed relation
with the trades unions (which become more and more just transmission
lines for impulses arising from below), the social dimension of objectives,
the rediscovery of a social perspective by the old sectors of the class
struggle, the emergence of the feminist component, of workers from the
tertiary sector and of `intellectual' labour (above all labour power in
training).109
Such movements "break with the purely defensive attitude to restructuring."110 They
challenge the Crisis State's managerial control of society, are informed by an ethic that
"emphasises the connections of social labour and highlights the importance of social co-
operation," and express, in a diffuse but unmistakable form an aspiration that "co-operative
production can be lead from the base, the globality of the post-industrial economy can be
assumed by social subjects."111
Communication Against Information
Of particular interest to this study of high-technology struggle is Negri's analysis of
the role of communication and information. For he emphasises that the "factory without
walls" is also the "information factory," a system whose operation depends on "the
growing identity between productive processes and forms of communication."112 The
conflicts of the Fordist era drove capital to interlink computers, telecommunications and
media in ever more extensive networks the more effectively to subordinate society. While
the mass worker laboured on a factory assembly-line, the socialised worker's productivity


163
emerges at the terminal of fibre optic lines, as a nurse monitoring cardiograms, a bank
clerk handling on-line transactions, a teacher in a computer lab, a programmer or a video
technician, or, indeed, as the audience of interactive television channel or the respondent to
a telemarketing survey. Her productivity depends on an elaborated network of informatic
systems.
However, this technological envelopment does not, Negri claims, necessarily result
in a subjugation of social labour. As the system of machines becomes all encompassing and
familiar, he argues, the socialised worker enjoys an increasingly "organic" relation to
technoscience.113 Although initiated by capital for purposes of control and command, as the
system grows it becomes for the socialised worker something else entirely, an "ecology of
machines."114 The "system of social machines" increasingly constitutes an everyday
ambience of potentials to be tapped and explored.115  The elaboration and alteration of this
techno-habitat becomes so pervasively socialised that it can no longer be exclusively
dictated by capital.
In the era of the mass worker, Negri says, the conditions of mechanised labour,
concentrated in the factory under the hand of management, led many militants to a "rejection
of science." In the age of the socialised worker, however, this situation is "surpassed," as
capital is obliged to both devolve and diffuse technological knowledge amongst its
workforce. The increasingly social nature of the technological apparatus now makes the
tactic of sabotage, crucial to the professional and mass worker, which Negri himself
espoused in the 1970s, less central. Rather, expanded possibilities for refunctioning and
recuperation appear. Technoscience becomes a site--perhaps, Negri suggests, the principle
site--for the reappropriation of power.116


164
This might seem reminiscent of Serge Mallet's earlier concept of a "new working
class" based in the skilled cadres of advanced industry.117 But Negri's theory differs in
positing the emergence not of a select intelligentsia of technical workers but of a
generalised form of labour power needed by a system now suffused in every pore with
technoscience. He claims that the new communicative capacities and technological
competencies manifesting in the contemporary workforce, while most explicit among
qualified workers, are not the exclusive attributes of this group, but rather exist in "virtual"
form among the contingent and unemployed labour force.118 They are not so much the
products of a particular training or specific work environment but rather the premises and
prerequisites of everyday life in a highly integrated technoscientific system permeated by
machines and media.
 
Negri suggests that the complexity and scope of the factory without walls creates
for capital "a specific social constitution--that of co-operation, or, rather, of intellectual
co-operation i.e. communication--a basis without which society is no longer
conceivable."119
Advanced capitalism directly expropriates labouring co-operation. Capital
has penetrated the entire society by means of technological and political
instruments (the weapons of its daily pillage of value) in order, not only to
follow and to be kept informed about, but to anticipate, organise and
subsume each of the forms of labouring co-operation which are established
in society in order to generate a higher level of productivity. Capital has
insinuated itself everywhere, and everywhere attempts to acquire the power


165
to co-ordinate, commandeer and recuperate value. But the raw material on
which the very high level of productivity is based--the only raw material
we know of which is suitable for an intellectual and inventive labour force-
-is science, communication and the communication of knowledge.120
To secure this co-operation, capital must appropriate the communicative capacity of the
labour force, making it flow within the stipulated technological and administrative
channels:
Capital must . . . appropriate communication. It must expropriate the
community and superimpose itself on the autonomous capability of
manufacturing knowledge, reducing such knowledge to a mere means of
every undertaking of the socialised worker. This is the form which
expropriation takes in advanced capitalism--or rather, in the world
economy of the socialised worker.121
However, to accomplish this expropriation, capital has to surround the socialised worker
with a dense web of communicative channels and devices.
Indeed in a rich, if cryptic, passage Negri claims that "communication is to the
socialised worker what the wage relationship was to the mass worker."122 This does not
mean that TV programs replace pay. Rather, Negri is suggesting that communicational
resources now constitute part of the bundle of goods and services capital must deliver to
workers to ensure its own continuing development. Just as in the era of the mass worker


166
Keynesian capital institutionalised wage increases as the motor of economic growth and
generalised the norms of mass consumption, so today, post-Keynesian capital
institutionalises the information infrastructure by which it hopes to rejuvenate itself,
`plugging in' its socialised workforce, multiplying points of contact with the networks,
furnishing and familiarising labour with a `wired' habitat through which instructions can be
streamed and feedback channelled.
But the analogy suggests more. In the Keynesian era, attempts to domesticate pay
demands as part of capitalist growth plans ultimately failed and became a focus for
struggle. Similarly, Negri sees the control of communication resources as an emergent
arena of tension. By informating production, capital seems to augment its powers of
control. But it simultaneously stimulates capacities that threaten to escape its command and
overspill into rivulets irrelevant to, or even subversive of, profit. Indeed, insofar as the
increasingly `communicative' texture of the modern economy discloses and intensifies the
fundamentally `socialised,' co-operative nature of labour, it comes into friction with
capital's hegemony.
This antagonism can be schematically represented as a conflict between
communication and information--an opposition roughly analogous to Marx's distinction
between living and dead labour: communicative activity is "current," information its
"imprisonment . . . within inert mechanisms of the reproduction of reality once
communication has been expropriated from its protagonists."123 Information is centralised,
vertical, hierarchic; communication is distributed, transverse, dialogic. Capital tries to
capture the communicative capacity of the labour force in its technological and
organisational forms "like a flat, glass screen on which is projected, fixed in black and


167
white, the mystified co-operative potentialities of social labour--deprived of life, just like
in a replay of Metropolis," while the direct current of communication takes transverse
"polychromatic forms."124 Or, in a different formulation, "conflict, struggle and diversity are
focussed on communication, with capital, by means of communication, trying to
preconstitute the determinants of life," while, on the other hand, "the socialised worker has
come to develop the critique of exploitation by means of the critique of communication."125
Negri's analysis of this conflict remains characteristically abstract. But one
example undoubtedly in his mind is the use of the Minitel computer system by French
student protestors. Minitel was originally designed as a one-way videotext service
transmitting government and corporate messages--phone directories, advertisements,
banking information, timetables--to French citizens.126 It was only changed when hackers
converted a small in-house mail system into an open, generalised exchange, an initiative
that proved so popular that it was incorporated into the official system--thereby laying the
basis for an email system perhaps most famous for its erotic "messagerie rose."
In 1986, however, Minitel attained more political dimensions when students
erupted in protest against neoliberal university `reforms,' and were met with a police
violence that resulted in at least one death. Frustrated by the mainstream media's hostility
or indifference to their cause, the Student Co-ordinating Committee, through the daily
newspaper Liberation, mounted a Minitel service for the revolt. This included information
about the spreading university and school closures, demonstrations, reasons to oppose the
proposed legislation changes, and a game service satirising the government updated news
bulletins, appeals.127Interactive "enter your reactions" section received 3000 calls from
across France, including questions about reasons for action, the level of student support,


168
the difficulties of government /student negotiations, and the on-line fees charged by the
telephone company. For Negri, the significance of the student revolt is that it represents the
capacity of labour in training--the emergence of a type of worker who embodies
"intellectual co-operation" and technoscientific literacy, and the capacity to use this
knowledge in oppositional form.
In the next chapter I give more concrete examples to support Negri's analysis. For
the moment, suffice it to say that the struggles between information and communication
which he has in mind would embrace the conflicts over the collective organisation of
work--`team concept,' `quality circles,' `TQM'--in production; the expansion of alternative
media activism contesting the corporate control of news and imagery; struggles in schools
and universities between capital's demand for a functionally educated workforce and
people's insistence in learning for their own purposes; the imposition and transgression of
proprietorial control over vital medical and ecological knowledge; and the struggle in
cyberspace between activists who have diverted global computer networking into an
unprecedented form of collective intellect, and capital's attempt re-seize it for commercial
purposes.
While the tentative nature of these oppositional projects is evident, Negri would
maintain that they constitute the prefigurations of an insubordinate anti-capitalist subject
whose identity is rooted in the communicative interconnections of socialised production.
While neoliberalism has launched a restructuring that has fatally decomposed the
traditional bastions of working class strength and imposed a historic reverse on the left,
"nothing," says Negri "tells us that the journey can be concluded according to the direction
established by capital." On the contrary, restructuring has also released "uncontrollable


169
effects . . . perverse from the capitalist point of view, but virtuous from the opposing point
of view," creating the conditions for an emergence of new subjects who "even if they
escape the historical continuity of the workers' movement, are nevertheless not easily
reconciled with capitalist plans for the market."128
. .. . . or Fragmented Worker?
To discern such a recompositional process amidst decades most on the left reckon
catastrophic is nothing if not audacious. Many consider it a theoretical whistling in the
dark. Alain Lipietz--voicing what is probably a fairly widespread opinion--has accused
Negri of a "headlong voluntarist flight into the future."129 Even many of Negri's political
allies dissent from his analysis, suspecting that enchantment with the `cycle of struggles'
leads him to find evidence of resurgence where little exists.130 Several autonomists have
been struck not so much by the unification and empowerment of labour in the information
economy as by an intensified fragmentation and hierarchisation. They have suggested that
Negri's work suffers from the defect of some many attempts to periodise class struggle--
namely, that an orientation toward what is perceived as the leading-edge of struggle leads
to a neglect of capital's tendency to pull together into a unified production system very
different kinds of labour--in other words to overlook its dependency on what Trotsky
referred to an "uneven and combined development."131
Thus in an analysis which extends the work of James and Dalla Costa, George
Caffentzis argues that capital's decomposition of the mass worker in the mid 1970s has
been accompanied by a redistribution of work in two directions. One is the growth of a
high-technology sector focussed on the "energy/information" field of oil, electricity,


170
nuclear power, and microelectronics.132 The other is the emergence of a low-technology
`service' sector, built around an influx of women into the work force, and partially
transforming traditional, unwaged reproductive labour in the home into a zone for direct
exploitation.
The "energy/information" and "service" sectors are functionally complementary for
capital, the former providing the cutting edge of profit-taking, the latter the mass
employment necessary to stabilise the wage relation. But they differ markedly in conditions
of work. While workers in the "high" sector may be technologically skilled, relatively
secure and perhaps even identify with their work as part of "the brains of the operation,"
the "low" end service sector worker is poorly paid, insecure, untrained, deskilled.133
Moreover, the sectors are differentiated by the age, race, and especially gender of their
labour power--the high sector being predominantly male and white, the low sector
disproportionately composed of workers who are young and/or coloured and/or female,
often performing a double shift of paid and unpaid reproductive labour at work and in the
home. The former gendered division between waged work and unwaged service is now
displaced and recapitulated within the wage zone.
Such polarisation raises serious questions about Negri's concept of the socialised
worker. It obviously affects the "organic" relation to technology he posits for his emergent
subject. The grand sweep of the socialised worker thesis often seems to minimise those
tendencies which separate strata of relatively well-skilled, well-paid workers--who may
indeed possess strategic technical and communicational capabilities--from the larger mass
of a post-industrial service-sector--janitors, fast-food operatives, and data-entry clerks--
subject to all the most deskilling and isolating effects of technological domination. Since


171
this division of the workforce tends to fall along lines of gender and race, to ignore it is to
risk universalising experiences most readily available to labour insofar as it is white and
male.
As numerous feminist analyses have made clear, the traditional masculinisation of
technology --formerly sedimented in the division between house and work--is to a
considerable degree perpetuated within the new informational economy. While it is not
unusual for women to have positions working with technology, men more often secure the
jobs in which they control technology, rather than being controlled by it--while female
workers experience classic deskilling effects.134 This can be the case even in situations
where workers of different genders use the `same' technology: telework, which can for
some--predominantly male--professionals offer significant convenience and control,
reveals a very different face in regard to the usually female data processor -- poorly paid,
outside legislative protection, closely monitored, isolated and unorganised within an
"electronic ghetto," Such patterns of segregation tend to be redoubled where the exclusions
of race are compounded with those of gender.
If this is the case, the opportunities for technological reappropriation that Negri
identifies may exist primarily for those who are most privileged--and therefore least likely
to use them subversively. In not explicitly addressing this issue, the socialised worker
theory invites the accusations--which other autonomists have in fact levelled against
Negri's work-- of generalising the experiences of relatively privileged workers in contact
with the most advanced sectors of capital and ignoring other strata.135 Moreover, in his
eagerness to identify the leading edge of working class development, Negri also sometimes
seems to dismiss the continued resilience of some `old' struggles-- one thinks, for example


172
of the persistent, and, from capital's point of view, very untimely, militancy of coal miners
in Britain, the USA, and Canada. All this suggests that the divisions within the post-Fordist
workforce are more complex and significant than Negri allows. Although theorists such as
Caffentzis undoubtedly share his hope for an eventual recomposition of the working class,
it is with far less optimism about its immediate prospects. In the hands of non-autonomist
theorists--including various Marxists and ex-Marxists--the segmentation of the
informational labour force is widely adduced as evidence of a final end to class politics.136
However, Negri's writings contain an implicit response to this charge, albeit one
which deserves amplification. He in fact emphasises that in describing the recomposition
of socialised labour power he not talking of "something definitive, concluded," but a
"potentiality", "a political act "which has to be asserted against resistance.137 Negri's
socialised worker is conceived as an agency in process, a subject formed in a struggle that
has at stake not only the relation between labour and capital, but also the relation of labour
to itself. The counter-tendency against which this recompositional movement asserts itself
is, precisely, capital's segmentation of the labour market along lines of gender, race, and
age, which tends toward a "South Africanisation" of society, splitting socialised labour
into isolated segments, just as Caffentzis and others have described.138
However, Negri believes that this `divide and conquer' strategy for decomposing
the socialised worker has some serious limitations. Capital's tendencies to social
apartheid, powerful as they are, are contradicted by a simultaneous tendency to subsume
labour within a single, unified system dependent on a common infrastructure. Its
simultaneous tendencies to `smooth' and `stratify' social space generate paradoxical results,
unanticipated interstitialities, upward and downward mobilities and flux. The


173
dissemination of technical knowledges and abilities cannot be limited to safe, reliable
strata of employees--who in fact often themselves feel the chill breath of insecurity--but is
made catholic by capital's own frenetic processes of circulation. The socialised worker's
familiarisation with and appropriation of their informational habitat is a process that
squirms under and over attempts to strategically contain and stratify it. The system of
segmentation leaks.
 Although Negri does not elaborate on the point, it is easy to muster examples: the
video counter-surveillance of police abuses in ghettoised sectors, the development of
highly technical modes of politico-cultural expression, such as certain strains of rap music,
the importance of community and `guerrilla' radio amongst subordinated groups, the crucial
role of film, video and media in feminist and anti-racist struggle, the increasing use of
computer networks--including feminist networks--to publicise otherwise invisible labour
struggles; and the remarkable exploration of cyberspace as a medium for the circulation of
struggles by some of the most marginalised and dispossessed sectors of the global
workforce--such as the Zapatistas in Chiapas. Indeed, it is precisely as an instrument to
overcome the segmentation of the workforce that the struggle of communication against
information to which Negri gives so much emphasis assumes its full importance.
Realistic assessment of the current state of class composition requires taking into
account both the recompositional possibilities on which Negri focuses, and the
decompositional tendencies stressed by Caffentzis and other autonomists. Both are present
tendencies, and their prominence in any given concrete instance varies. Negri's analysis is
clearly rooted in some of the remarkable cross-sectorial linkages made in the French
movements--although even there, sectoralism enormously impedes mobilisations against


174
neoliberalism. Caffentzis' more sombre perspective reflects the near-disastrous working
class atomisation in the United States. Yet, as we will see, even in the North American
context of fragmentation there are important countervailing tendencies. With both these
potentialities present, digital capitalism constitutes what Negri calls "an enormous node of
strategic contradictions--like a boiling volcano"139 The next chapter descends deeper into
the volcano, and more closely observes its eruptions.

4 Michael Lebowitz, Beyond Capital: Marx's Political Economy of the Working Class
(New York: St Martin's Press, 1992).Lebowitz argues that this focus on the activity of
capital, rather than workers began with Marx himself, who completed Capital, but never
his projected book on wage labour. The result is a perspective in which the worker
appears primarily as passive object ground between the wheels of capital's exploitative
machine. This machine is, to be sure, a self destructive one--driven toward disaster by
inexorable internal laws. But it runs toward breakdown on its own--until eventually, in a
moment of massive reversal, the immiserated proletariat revolts. While the consequences
of such a view have varied, they have been almost uniformly catastrophic, and indeed
largely justify the many criticisms of Marx made by new social movement theorists. On the
one hand, it has generated a teleological--and fatally misplaced--confidence in the
inevitability of revolution. On the other, when it is suspected that the `laws' of economic
collapse are not manifesting on schedule, it fosters the vision of capital as an invincible

juggernaut capable of assimilating every opposition within its one-dimensional order.
Further, insofar as such an account can see workers only, as it were, through the eyes of
capital--as so much labour-power--it does, as so many anti-Marxist s have claimed, tend
toward a reductionism in which people are regarded only as the bearers of economic
categories, emptied of sexuality, culture, pleasure--everything, indeed, that makes life
worth living. And finally, since the only historical project visible in such an account is that
of capital, it makes it difficult to imagine revolution as anything but the extension or
completion of capitalist development, albeit in either faster or fairer terms i.e. `socialism.'

articles in Marie Blanche Tahon and Andre Corten, eds., Actes du Colloque de Montreal,
L'Italie: le Philosophe et le Gendarme, (Montreal: VLB Editeur, 1986) provide a valuable
retrospective assessment. Important anthologies of autonomist Marxist writings are Red
Notes, Working Class Autonomy and the Crisis (London: Red Notes,1979) and Sylvere
Lotringer and Christian Marazzi, eds., Italy: Autonomia--Post-Political Politics (New
York: Semiotext(e), 1980). Robert Lumley, States of Emergency: Cultures of Revolt in
Italy From 1968 to 1978 (London: Verso, 1990) gives a rather hostile account of autonomia
in its historical context, while Nanni Balestrini, The Unseen.(London: Verso, 1989) gives a
vivid novelistic description of its rise and fall. My synoptic account of Italian autonomist
Marxism necessarily distorts its complex history: in particular it scants the relationship of
the earlier Italian operaismo or `workerism' focussed around factory struggles of the
industrial proletariat to the later currents merged in the broad social movement of


179
                                                                                                                                                
autonomia. Tronti and Panzieri belong to the former, not the latter. Indeed, Tronti split
politically with theorists of autonomia such as Negri who built substantially on his work.
Nonetheless, I find sufficient continuity in their line of thought to classify all as `autonomist
Marxists.' A key English language analysis of the Italian New Left is Steven Wright,
Forcing the Lock: The Problem of Class Composition in Italian Workerism, unpub. Ph.D.
Dissertation, (Monash University, Australia, 1988) which emphasises the difference
between operaismo and autonomia and gives a fascinating analysis of the debates and
struggles within the movement.
15 Readers will look in vain for any mention of autonomist Marxism in either Perry
Anderson's periodic reports on the state of Western Marxism, Considerations on Western
Marxism (London: New Left, 1976) or In the Tracks of Historical Materialism (London:
Verso, 1983) or in the Dictionary of Marxist Thought, ed. Tom Bottomore, Laurence
Harris, V.G. Kiernan, Ralph Miliband (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1983).
16 The main vehicle for the current work of Negri and his colleagues is the French journal
Futur Antérieur. Some indication of its direction can be found in Hardt and Negri, Labor of
Dionysus, and in Chapter 9 of this dissertation. Other strands of autonomist Marxism
include, in the United States, the work of Harry Cleaver, and of George Caffentzis and the
Midnight Notes collective--a selection of whose work can be found in Midnight Notes
Collective, Midnight Oil: Work, Energy, War 1973-1992. (Brooklyn NY: Autonomedia,
1992); in Britain, by the publications of the Red Notes Collective; in Italy, by a new
generation of autonomist activists, largely focussed around the formation of `social
centres,' and internationally by Selma James' organisation of the "wages for housework"

on the "aggregate domination of variable by constant capital," "class composition"
involves a "disaggregated picture of the structure of class power existing within the
division of labor associated with a particular organisation of constant and variable
capital." ("The Inversion of Class Perspective," 113). Note that such a perspective does
not dismiss the interminably-debated falling-rate-of-profit tendency. But it sees this
tendency as defining a line of combat. In this view, capital's drive to increase constant over
variable capital derives not primarily from the exigencies of competition, but in the first
instance from its need to control with automation the threat of class conflict. Equally, its
ability to avoid being choked by the weight of technological innovation depends on how
inventively and on what terms it can impose counter-tendencies to offset this self-
asphyxiation--perhaps most importantly through manufacturing new work to replace that
being eliminated by machines. In each case, what is critical to the organic composition of
capital is the class composition of the labour it confronts--the degree of resistance or
compliance which capital encounters in its attempts to exercise command.

30 As Cleaver notes, in using the concept "cycle of struggles" it is important to avoid
suggesting a foreordained, quasi-Spenglarian natural `law' of history which determines that
workers' struggles spring up, die down and are renewed ("The Inversion of Class
Perspective," 6.) If these conflicts do indeed recur, even after the most crushing defeats, it
is because i) capital has not, to date, freed itself from the need for workers and ii) its logic


183
                                                                                                                                                
imposes on the lives of these workers constraints and limitations against which they rebel.
This view does not preclude the possibility either of false starts--workers' initiatives
which are suppressed within the existing structures of capital without compelling it to
restructure, or, equally, worker's victories--in which capital fails to reattain control.

33 "Subsumption" designates the degree to which labour is absorbed into capital's
processes of value extraction. In the 'Unpublished Sixth Chapter' of Capital, Marx
described this process in terms of successive stages. In "formal subsumption"--roughly the
early stages of the industrial revolution--capital simply imposes the form of wage labour
on pre-existing modes of artisanal production. But in the subsequent phase, "real
subsumption," it undertakes a wholesale reorganisation of work. Science is systematically
applied to industry; technological innovation becomes perpetual; exploitation focuses on
`relative' intensification of productivity rather than `absolute' extension of hours;
economies of scale and co-operation are systematically sought out; and consumption is
organised by the cultivation of new needs which beckon on new industries in an orgy of
"productions for production's sake." In this phase, Marx observes, the agent of production
ceases to be the individual labourer and becomes the "collective worker, made up of
labour power "socially combined" in all the manifold differentiated yet interdependent
tasks "which together form the entire production machine." The "limbs" of this collective
subject encompass both physical and intellectual activity: "Some work better with their
hands, others with their heads, one as a manager, engineer, technologist, etc., the other as


184
                                                                                                                                                
overseer, the third as manual labourer or even drudge. . . And here it is quite immaterial
whether the job of a particular worker, who is merely a limb of this aggregate worker, is at
a greater or smaller distance from the actual manual labour." See Capital, vol 1. 1026-
1040. Autonomist Marxism's concept of the "social factory" is the theory of this "collective
worker" grown beyond a point even Marx could anticipate.

51 My account here rewrites in terms familiar to English speaking audiences the distinction
Negri makes in "Domination and Sabotage," Working Class Autonomy and the Crisis
(London: Red Notes, 1979) 93-138, between "sabotage" and "invention power."
52 Extracts are reprinted in Red Notes, Working Class Autonomy and the Crisis (London:
Red Notes, 1979).
53 By "sabotage" Negri was in fact designating a very broad concept of refusing and
undermining capitalist development. But there is no doubt that this included its most
concrete and pointed applications: strikes, `direct action' and the destruction of machinery-
-tactics for which autonomia was to develop a formidable reputation.

Analysis. (Norwood: Ablex. 1986).

60 "Detournement" is a term deriving from the Situationists, with whom the Italian
autonomia had a distinct affinity. It describes the reassemblage of elements torn out of their
original context in order to make a subversive political statement; see Ken Knabb, ed.
Situationist International Anthology (Berkeley: Bureau of Public Secrets, 1981) 8-14, 55-
56; Guy Debord, Society of the Spectacle (Detroit: Black and Red, 1977); and, for useful
commentary Cleaver, "The Inversion of Class Perspective."
61 Cleaver, "Technology as Political Weaponry" 264.
62 On the fluidity of technology, see Cleaver, "Technology as Political Weaponry" 268: "A
given technology is never the same when it is implemented in different historical and
political contexts. As an organisation of social production, technology organises the
existing social relations, and those shift and change according to the changing composition
of political power."
63 Moulier, "L'operaisme italien." He stresses that the periodisation should not be taken to
mean that the workers of one era vanish at the commencement of the next: professional
workers persist into the era of the mass worker, and mass workers into the epoch of the
socialised worker: the point is that the innovative and strategic centre of struggle shifts.

practice information and communication are not easily separable: computerisation
represents an attempt by capital to enhance its informational powers, but may in practice
allow communicational opportunities for workers. For this reason, "One must . . . be very
careful in the use we make of the distinction, occasionally using it, if one wishes, as an
abstract, definitional distinction, but bearing in mind that it is quite inadequate for analysis
of the concrete."

129 Alain Lipietz, The Enchanted World: Inflation, Credit and the World Crisis (London:
Verso, 1985) 141. The resemblances between the autonomists' theory of "cycles of
struggle" and the Regulation School's concept of successive "regimes of accumulation"--
with the era of the mass worker corresponding to Fordism, and the socialised worker to
post-Fordism--will be apparent. In fact, both groups have influenced each other, while
taking very different orientations--the Regulation School theorists preoccupying themselves
with the requirements for successful capitalist accumulation, the autonomists searching for
possibilities to explode that process. Perhaps predictably, they arrive at different
conclusions, with autonomists--or at least Negri--perceiving the onset of a new era of
struggle, and Regulation School theorists settling for accommodation. Negri, although
sometimes using the Fordist/post-Fordist terminology, has criticised the Regulationists as
an "academic school" who have abandoned the "critique of political economy" in favour of
a "functionalist and programmatic schema." ("Interpretation of the Class Situation Today"
104-105).
130 For example Sergio Bologna was intensely critical of Negri's attempt to contain the
complexities arising from the restructuring of labour power within a single grand
theoretical construct. For an exciting and informative summary of the criticism of Negri's
"socialised worker" thesis by Bologna and other of his Italian comrades see Wright, 287-

German "autonomen" movements appears in  GeorgeKatsiaficas, The Subversionof
Politics: European Autonomous Social Movements and the Decolonization of Everyday
Life (New Jersey: Humanities Press, 1997). It should, however, be noted that Negri's
account of the "socialised worker" has developed over the course of time, and its most
recent versions are more substantial than its initial enunciation.

insufficiently skilled to escape automation but expensive enough to be worth replacement.
Of the remainder a substantial number are `upgraded' to provide `intellective' tasks for a
new echelon of technicians and programmers. A larger portion are downgraded, "recycled
in low-skill, low-pay activities in the miscellaneous service sector, or integrated in the
booming informal economy in both manufacturing and services" with lower wages and
little or no social protection. This generates a dualised occupational pattern whose
divisions follow predictable lines of gender and ethnicity, and are reinforced by self-
perpetuating residential enclaves, educational chances, and differential exposure to media
and information flows. What results is "a highly differentiated social structure, both
polarised and fragmented."(205)Professional and managerial classes identify with capital,
and the remainder of the working population, with their variegated positions in the new
production systems reflected and amplified in their territorial differentiation in the city are
divided into "socially discriminated communities that cannot constitute a class" "(228,
