Marx's Machines
It is too late in the day to become intensely vexed as to what Marx `really said'
about technology. For Marx was, like all of us, a multiple. He wrote variously about
technology, making statements that cannot all be reconciled one with another--or at least,
can be reconciled in very different, sometimes radically opposed, ways. In the historical
development of Marxism this heterogeneity of utterances has yielded a volume of
interpretation which now weighs considerably on the brain of the living, and whose
influence powerfully refracts every re-reading of their source.
This chapter begins, therefore, with a scan of the many representations of the
machine in Marx's texts. It then moves on to see what other Marxists have made of and
from these representations as they respond to the 'information revolution.' Three positions
are examined: scientific socialism, which sees technoscience as a central agent in a
dialectical drama culminating in the inevitable defeat of capital; neo-Luddism, which
focuses on technology as instruments of capitalist domination; and post-Fordism, which
often looks to the possibility of a technologically mediated reconciliation between labour
and capital. While this is by no means a complete inventory of Marxist, or Marxist-
derived, thought on technological change, it does muster the major analyses with which I
want to take issue. For, I argue, scientific socialists, neo-Luddites and post-Fordists all,
though in very different ways, fall short of an adequate response to the challenge of the
information revolutionaries.


78
As we have already seen, there is a certain Marx very close in spirit to the
information revolutionaries--the Marx of "The handmill gives you society with the feudal
lord; the steam-mill with the industrial capitalist."1 This technologically determinist Marx
is not a negligible figure.2 His hand has been seen at work in the celebrated account in the
Preface to the Contribution to a Critique of Political Economy of how "in the social
production of their life men enter into definite relations that are independent of their will,
relations of production which correspond to a definite stage of development of their
material productive forces."3 At a certain stage in their development, Marx says, "the
material productive forces of society come into conflict with the existing relations of
production" and "from forms of development of the productive forces these relations turn
into their fetters"--thereby initiating social revolution.4
What precisely constitutes the forces of production and what the relations of
production, and the precise nature of the interaction between the two, are amongst the most
controversial questions in Marxist theory.5 But what is certain is that a view which sees the
forces of production as technological, and only the relations of production as social, with
the former having primacy over the latter seems to have taken root very close to Marx
himself, in the work of his friend Frederick Engels, who wrote that with the advancement
of modern machinery "the productive forces themselves press forward with increasing
power towards . . . their deliverance from their character as capital."6 From there extends a
line of Marxist thought, along whom are posted figures such as Nikolai Bukharin, J.D.
Bernal and G.A. Cohen, which understands technological development as an autonomous
force, a motor of history, whose ever expanding productive powers smash relentlessly


79
through anachronistic forms of property ownership in a trajectory heading straight to the
triumph of socialism.7
However, there are other passages in Marx that modify and indeed contradict this
mechanistic view of history. For example, the major treatments of factory machinery in
Capital tells a story in which capitalism, as it deepens its control of the workplace and
society transforms methods of production. Marx describes this process in terms of
successive degrees of "subsumption."8 In "formal subsumption"--roughly the early stages of
the industrial revolution--capital simply imposes the form of wage labour on pre-existing
modes of artisanal production. But in the subsequent phase, "real subsumption," it
undertakes a wholesale reorganisation of work. Science is systematically applied to
industry; technological innovation becomes perpetual; exploitation focuses on a “relative”
intensification of productivity rather than an “absolute” extension of hours.9
Central to this process of subsumption is the replacement of manual methods of
work by machinofacture. And the impetus for this development is, Marx says, the factory
master's drive to enhance command over his labour force by deskilling craft workers and
enlarging the reserve army of the unemployed. Such a narrative precisely reverses the
technologically determinist account. For it is social relations--capital's requirement for
total control over the valorisation process--that shapes machines, not vice versa. From the
reading of such passages flows a different line of analysis whose exponents run from
Georg Lukacs through to Harry Braverman and David Noble, who insist that machinery is
only a moment in forces of production whose constitution is itself a matter of social
power.10


80
However, even if it could be agreed that Marx posits a complex interaction
between `social' and `technological' factors--indeed, complex to the point where the two
categories are understood as so inseparably bound up as to make him one of the first
theorists of what today are termed `socio-technical systems'--there would still be space for
disagreement in his writing on machines. Many readers have been impressed by his
nightmare portrayal of nineteenth century factory masters' use of technology. Throughout his
work, Marx again and again tells us how machinery confronts the worker in production as
the power of capital incarnate--or at least metallized. The steam engine serves as an
"instrument of torture" in the hands of the factory owner. In a necrotic tyranny, the "dead
labour" of automatic machinery becomes a "mechanical monster" with "demonic power"
that "dominates, and pumps dry, living labour power," converting the worker into a "living
appendage."11 Or, as Marx put it in a speech to the Chartists in 1856,
At the same pace that mankind masters nature, man seems to become
enslaved to other men . . All our invention and progress seem to result in
endowing material forces with intellectual life, and stultifying human life
into a material force.12
From this, and many other passages can be distilled a technophobic, dystopian, neo-
Luddite Marx, a Marx who rages against the machine.
Yet the production of such a Marx depends on a considerable effort of edition and
selection. For there are other moments where Marx speaks not just of the infernal effects of
machines, but also of their emancipatory promise. For example, in one passage of Capital
he discusses how "modern industry" continually transforms itself "by means of machinery,


81
chemical processes and other methods" and in doing so "incessantly throws masses of
capital and of workers from one branch of production to another," in a way that
"necessitates variation of labour, fluidity of functions, and mobility of workers in all
directions."13 Under capital, Marx says, this incessant technological change is an
appallingly destructive, immiserating force, which "does away with all repose, all fixity
and all security as far as the worker's life situation is concerned."14 However, he argues,
such relentless innovation also has a potentially positive side. By annihilating the narrow
specialisations that previously characterised craft production it makes possible "the
recognition of variation of labour and hence of the fitness of the worker for the maximum
number of different kinds of labour."15
Modern industry thus opens the vision of an alternative--communist--social order in
which the "monstrosity" of technological unemployment is replaced by the "possibility of
varying labour." 16 The "partially developed individual, who is merely the bearer of one
specialised social function" will give way to "the totally developed individual, for whom
the different social functions are different modes of activity he takes up in turn."17 Citing a
French worker who claimed that constantly changing trades in California made him feel
"less of a mollusc and more of a man," Marx recommends the development of technical,
agricultural and vocational schools, in which "the children of the workers receive a certain
amount of instruction in technology."18 From such moments can be constructed another
Marx, an enthusiast for the progressive possibilities of human-machine interaction.19
Although much of Marx's writing on machines concerns factory automation, a
broadly similar ambivalence informs his observations about the other great technological
innovations of his age--those in the sphere of communication and transport.20 For Marx, the


82
telegraph, the steamship and the railway were the inseparable concomitants to the
development of factory production, instruments for the creation of the world market
necessary to supply the raw materials and absorb the goods produced by industrial
machinery, an extension of capital's ceaseless revolutionising of the means of production.
They were the manifestations of a relentless dynamic which "chases the bourgeoisie over
the whole surface of the globe" compelling it to "nestle everywhere, settle everywhere,
establish connections everywhere."21
As such, the new channels of travel and communication were tendrils for the
extension of a system of domination. In a passage which strikingly anticipates the
conditions of contemporary globalisation Marx writes of how:
Every development in the means of new productive forces is at the same
time a weapon against the workers. All improvements in the means of
communication, for example facilitate the competition of workers in
different localities and turns local competition into national.22
Elsewhere, Marx analyses the new means of communication as essential component in the
"autonomisation of the world market," elevating monetary exchanges into an force whose
impersonal and relentless processes appear to stand over and against any possibility of
human intervention or transformation.23 These observations--especially when linked to
Marx's remarks on ideology and commodity fetishism--have provided planks for a Marxist
political economy focused almost entirely on the dominative effects of capitalist media and
information industries.


83
Yet at the same time, and even more emphatically than in the case of industrial
machinery, Marx also saw liberatory possibilities in the nineteenth century communications
revolution. The telegraph, fast mails, and travel broke down parochialism, localism and
narrow national interests. As such, they were potential catalysts for proletarian
internationalism. Indeed, The Communist Manifesto's famous exhortation to the "workers of
the world" is prefaced by a series of enthusiastic observations on how this "ever expanding
union of workers" is "helped on by the improved means of communication that are created
by modern industry and that place the workers of different localities in contact with one
another."24 This is one vital aspect of a process by which "the bourgeoisie "forges the
weapons that bring death to itself" and also calls into existence "the men who are to wield
these weapons--the modern working class-the proletarians."25
In his own life, Marx was eager to take advantage of such possibilities. According
to James Billington, Marx and Engels on one occasion planned to penetrate the
international wire agencies in Brussels, through a leftist press agency, in order to distribute
their messages more widely!26As Peter Waterman notes, this may not be quite enough to
make Marx a `hacker' avant la lettre! Nevertheless, the enthusiasm for the revolutionary
possibilities of mass communication so evident in his texts has resonated with theorists
from Bertholt Brecht and Walter Benjamin to Hans Magnus Enzensburger onwards.27
These synoptic observations only skim the surface of Marx's machine-writings. But
they are perhaps enough to establish that throughout these texts there runs an electric
tension, an alternating current that oscillates between rival possibilities. At one pole,
technology is an instrument of capitalist domination, a means for the intensification of
exploitation and the enchaining of the world in commodity exchange. On the other, it is the


84
basis for the freedom from want and the social intercourse that are prerequisites for a
communist society. How much emphasis is given to each pole, and by what logic or
narrative they are connected, is, however a matter of huge contention. Later, like all the
other interpreters, I will select my own favoured points of reference, the passages where,
for me, Marx's antinomies about the machine fuse at white heat into brilliant insight. But for
the moment, we will see what others have made of Marx's ambiguous machines.
 Scientific Socialism
I use the term `scientific socialism' to designate that form of Marxism --also
variously referred to as `objectivist,' `classical' or `neo-orthodox' Marxism--which, taking
its direction from Marx and Engel's observations about the contradictions between forces
and relations of production, sees history driven by scientifically predictable laws of
motion toward a socialist destination.28 Perhaps the most sophisticated recent example of
this school of thought is to be found in the work of Ernest Mandel, the eminent theoretician
of the Fourth International.
Mandel's magnum opus, Late Capitalism, was first published in 1968 and translated
into English in 1975. It represents a magisterial attempt to reinsert many of the societal
phenomena which were at that time being claimed by post-industrial theorists to mark the
definitive supersession of Marxism--cybernetics and other new technologies, the
increasing importance of planning and education, and the increasingly `knowledge based'
nature of economic development--within the framework of historical materialism. For
Mandel's fundamental claim is that the societies of contemporary Europe and North
America, far from having transcended the features of capitalism described by Marx, in fact
exhibited them in a singularly pure form.29


85
Mandel argues that there have been three fundamental moments in capitalism, each
one marking a dialectical expansion over the previous stage: market capitalism, monopoly
capitalism, and our own phase, "late capitalism." He links the appearance of these stages to
Kondratieff's famous theory of "long waves"--successive, rhythmic episodes of economic
growth and stagnation which supposedly dominate the last two centuries of Western
history. In each wave, surges in technological innovation are precipitated by temporary
increases in the rate of profit after a protracted period of under-investment. Corresponding
to the three phases of capitalism are three "general revolutions in technology"-- steam
driven machinery of the 1840s, electric and combustion motors of the 1890s, and, from the
1940s on, the "third technological revolution" of nuclear power and computerisation.
The central feature of this latest phase is the increasing level of automation, and, in
particular, the replacement of industrial workers by cybernetic systems and continuous
flow processes based on automatic control. This brings with it a series of interrelated
developments, which reverberate through the capitalist economy. These include a shift of
living labour from the actual treatment of raw materials to preparatory or supervisory
functions; new developments in organised research and university education; a speed up in
production and a consequent pressure for more effective inventory control, market research
and demand management; and increasingly large, and increasingly quickly obsolete,
investments in large technological systems. These developments in turn generate a
compulsion to introduce exact planning of production not only within each enterprise but
also within the economy as a whole--leading to more state intervention. All of these
changes, however, relate back to the overwhelming imperative of capitalism, the
maintenance of the rate of profit.30


86
This analysis brings Mandel into direct confrontation with the first expressions of
post-industrial theory. Categorically rejecting any idea that the new economic centrality of
science and technological knowledge mark some unprecedented historical epoch, Mandel
argues that " Late capitalism, far from representing a `post-industrial society,' . . .appears
as the period in which all branches of the economy are fully industrialised for the first
time."31 Specifically citing Bell's work as an example of prevalent theories of
"technological rationalism," he declares that "Belief in the omnipotence of technology is
the specific form of bourgeois ideology in late capitalism":
This ideology proclaims the ability of the existing social order gradually to
eliminate all chances of crises, to find a `technical' solution to all its
contradictions, to integrate rebellious social classes and to avoid political
explosions.32
However, Mandel says, the idea that new technologies allow capitalism to transcend its
perennial antagonisms and crises is spurious; on the contrary, such innovations only bring
closer its inevitable collapse.
Although Mandel enumerates a wide array of factors, all of which he sees
interacting to generate breakdown, the centrepiece of his argument is a traditional mainstay
of `objectivist ' Marxism: the falling rate of profit, consequent on the rising organic
composition of capital. To understand this argument a brief technical exposition is
necessary.33
The Marxist theory of value holds that the source of surplus value is the
exploitation of living labour. Capitalist production can be represented in value by the


87
formula C+V+S. C is "constant capital"--the part whose value is not increased in
production but merely preserved by it--buildings, raw materials, and, especially, machines.
V is "variable" capital, the part used by the capitalist to buy labour power, so termed
because it is the only part of capital which lets the capitalist increase the value of his/her
capital. S is the "surplus value" --the portion of the newly created value appropriated by
the capitalist. The rate of profit is the ratio between surplus value and total
capital=S/(C+V). The ratio between constant capital and variable capital, C/V, is the
`organic composition of capital.'
The fundamental tendency of the capitalist system is to increase the ratio of constant
capital (machines and raw materials) to variable capital (wages). For Mandel--and most
other objectivist Marxists--the principal impetus in this direction comes from the "whip of
competition" amongst capitals, which compels entrepreneurs to constantly automate in
order to raise productivity.34 But if the organic composition of capital, C/V increases, other
things being equal, the profit rate S/(C+V) will decline. The more completely
mechanisation expels workers from production, the more the rate, and eventually the mass,
of surplus value diminishes. This decline in profitability causes faltering investment,
catalyses class conflict and drives irrevocably toward revolutionary crisis. Capital's
profit-driven compulsion to expand the forces of production thus becomes the instrument of
its self-destruction.
This formally elegant argument is a topic of immense controversy, even amongst
Marxists. In his original account of the `falling rate of profit,' Marx identified certain
countertendencies--intensified exploitation of labour; cheapening of the elements of
constant capital (i.e. increased efficiency in the manufacture of machines, new sources of


88
raw materials); the opening up of industries with low organic composition; increases in
foreign trade; speed up in the turnover in capital--all of which might alter the inevitability
of the falling rate of profit.35 But in neo-orthodox accounts these tend to be seen as
subsidiary factors.36 Certainly Mandel believes that "the fall in the average rate of profit is
inescapable."37
Cybernetics, by bringing in sight the `workerless factory' drives this process to a
climax, placing on the horizon what Mandel terms "the absolute inner limit of the capitalist
mode of production"--the point where fully automated production no longer allows the
creation of surplus value.38
 The absolute limit . . . lies in the fact that the mass of surplus value itself
necessarily diminishes as a result of the elimination of living labour from
the production process in the course of the final stage of mechanisation.
Capitalism is incompatible with fully automated production in the whole of
industry and agriculture, because this no longer allows for the creation of
surplus value or valorisation of capital.39
To secure this prediction Mandel makes certain theoretical assumptions which rule out
capital discovering way of lowering the average organic composition by moving outside
its traditional factory base. The development of the service sector is discounted on the
grounds that most work in this area, because it does not change the "bodily form" of a
commodity, is "unproductive."40 A shift of labour power to spheres of research and design
is similarly rejected because such a transformation "would imply a radical suppression of
the social division between manual and intellectual labour" which would "undermine the


89
entire hierarchical structure of factory."41 Having blocked off these boltholes, Mandel can
be confident that the third technological revolution seals the fate of capital.
Mandel does not see capitalism straightforwardly automating itself into oblivion.
Rather, he believes that declining profits will ultimately cause it to check automation. But
the closure of this route to expansion will lead to crisis-ridden stagnation and intensified
conflict over the allocation of surplus. In fact, capitalism is caught in the historical trap
foreseen by Marx, where its achievement in expanding the forces of production unleash
conflicts that explode the social relations its continuance requires. While Mandel qualifies
the finality of his verdict, admitting of reprieves and postponements, the teleology is
inscribed in his masterwork's title--Late Capitalism.
In many ways, Mandel's work is a brilliant answer to Bell and the post-
industrialists. By showing how so many of the allegedly new features of contemporary
society cited by these theorists relate to the very old logic of accumulation, he effectively
refutes the claim that the logic of capital has been replaced by some unprecedented and
benign informational principle. Moreover, at the time of its publication Mandel's
prediction of renewed economic crisis showed remarkable prescience compared with the
post-industrialists rosy forecasts of unimpeded economic growth.
What is striking, however, is the subterranean affinity between Mandel and his
post-industrial opponents. To a remarkable degree such "automatic Marxism" mirrors the
assumptions of the very theories it opposes.42 There is disagreement about the prospects for
scientific-technological innovation yielding capital a smooth, evolutionary future. But there
is a common view of the forces of production--seen primarily as machines--as central
instruments of inevitable social transformations. In Late Capitalism the dance of machines


90
and capitalists moves like clockwork towards a foreordained conclusion which uncannily
echoes the linearity of post-industrial doctrine.
Unlike more vulgar scientific socialists, Mandel is not a technological determinist
who reduces revolution to a consequence of autonomous scientific progress. On the
contrary, he dialectically relates capital's mechanical self-destruction to its competitive
drive for innovation. But he is a social determinist for whom technology relentlessly
executes a predecided verdict. The distance between this position and the "bourgeois" faith
in the "omnipotence of technology" is not as great as he would like to imagine. As
interpreted by Mandel, the doctrine of the falling rate of profit in fact functions as a mirror
image of the upward path of progress espoused by Bell and the post-industrialists, the one
leading as surely to socialist victory as the other does to capitalist stability.43
There are theoretical reasons even for those who share Mandel's premises to doubt
his conclusions. As I have noted, Marx himself noted the existence of countertendencies to
the 'falling rate of profit,' and many Marxists see its supposed inevitability as a special
case obtaining only under specific conditions.44 Capitalism's deployment of new
technologies certainly drives living labour out of production (through automation), but it
can also enhance the countertendencies against the falling rate of profit by increasing the
rate of exploitation (through surveillance and monitoring), cheapening machine production
(robots making robots), opening new areas of exploitation with a low organic composition
(tertiarisation), speeding circulation (through advertising, marketing and innovation) and
integrating the world market (telecommunications). Mandel rejects such possibilities with
arguments whose intricacy verges on the quasi-theological. But such possibilities seem
significant enough to cast doubt on his teleological certainty. This is not to ratify the post-


91
industrialists' dreams of unimpeded market expansion. But it is to see crisis as contingent
on the outcome of series of social struggles over the scope, scale and velocity of
commodification rather than guaranteed by capital's own internal logic.
What is remarkable about Mandel's account is the absence of any agency for such
struggles. At the moment of crisis, of course, the working class is summoned to seize the
revolutionary hour. But a striking feature in the pages of Late Capitalism is that this crucial
protagonist, the ostensible raison d’être of the whole drama, is in fact largely invisible--far
less closely analysed than capital and its machines. When, elsewhere, Mandel does discuss
the modern proletariat, it is essentially to reaffirm the verity of Marx's description of the
industrial worker, dismiss the significance of the "manipulations" of the mass media, and
assert the guarantee of revolutionary commitment given by "the basic structural stability of
the proletarian condition."45 In such objectivist analysis there is little sense of labour as a
living subject, animated by needs and desires; little sense that this subject might change,
altering in complexity and capacity in ways at least as dynamic as that of the dead labour
embodied in machines, or that capitalist development might itself be crucially shaped by its
efforts to harness and contain the energies of this collective subject. Mandel's dialectic of
productive forces and relations, in short, skips over class struggle. It is rhetorically
prominent but analytically ancillary, the insurgencies of the labouring subject merely the
predestined reflex of capitalism's auto-destruction.
Moreover, this covert affinity between the determinism of Marxist scientific
socialism and bourgeoisie theories of technological development extends further to touch
the very concept of socialism. For if socialism is seen as a by-product of the advance of
science and technology, rather than as a result of people's rebellion and self-organisation,


92
the revolutionary task easily becomes defined as the speeding of technoscientific advance
at all costs--including the suppression of any resistance or alternative offered by the very
workers in whose name the revolution is undertaken. Where the consequences of this
concept appeared in truly grotesque form was of course in the late Soviet regime--in which
the objectivism of scientific Marxism combined with a logic of vanguardism,
substitutionism and technocratic expertise in a fatal mix.
As a student of Trotsky, Mandel necessarily maintained a highly ambiguous
position toward the Soviet Union. But his notion of a "third technological revolution" has a
strong similarity to the notion of a "scientific technological revolution" or "STR" embraced
by Soviet officials and academicians in the 1960s and 70s.46 Such theories, which foresaw
a new historical epoch inaugurated by cybernetic automation, essentially recapitulated
bourgeoisie theories of post-industrialism, with the caveat that the beneficiary of the "STR"
would be not capitalism, but socialism. In the Soviet bloc the planned realisation of the
"STR" would be a vital lever for the achievement of a classless society, while in the West,
the anarchy of the market would intensify contradictions, conflict and disintegration. But
the essential terms of the analysis were little different from Bell's or Brezinski's--and the
accompanying injunctions about the necessity of adjusting people's subjective attitude to
the new objective realities were, if anything, even more chilling.
What links information society theory and scientific socialism is a shared, though
differently inflected, determinism that subordinates the wishes of human subjects to the
necessity of technoscientific advance. Each duplicates the other's linearity, scientism, and
technocratic tendencies. As such, both are doctrines suitable for regimes in which the
means of production have been sequestered from collective control, whether by a


93
corporate or a bureaucratic class. This is precisely why information revolutionaries have
been able to borrow so much from scientific socialists, and vice versa-.47 The former were
of course, more successful than the latter: the Soviet advocates of STR failed to make the
innovations the Western information revolutionaries are, with at least temporary success,
effecting. But what divides the promulgators of such doctrines is the sort of distinction that
differentiates carnivorous dinosaurs into tyrannosaurs--bulky but deadly--and
velociraptors--fast, agile, and even more lethal. With the demise of the Bolshevik
experiment, all the teleological certainties of scientific socialism have been thrown up in
the air. The one thing that is sure, however, is the irrelevance to future struggles of a
Marxism convinced of predestined triumph, fixated with the industrial factory, and carrying
internally the seeds of the very dominative logic against which it contends.
 Technology As Domination
From the late 1960s--in the very period post-industrial theory emerged--attitudes
amongst many European and North American Marxists toward technoscience moved in a
direction notably different from that of scientific socialism. Confronting assembly lines,
napalm manufacturers and nuclear power plants, growing numbers of theoreticians and
activists rediscovered the dark, nightmarish aspects of Marx's writings on technology. Seen
through the window of such writings, emergent technologies of automation and
communication seemed more likely to strengthen capital than undermine it. The new forces
of production appeared not as agencies automatically and autonomously bursting apart the
old relations of production, but rather as themselves implacably shaped by those relations,
designed and deployed at the behest of a ruling class to whose purposes they were almost
entirely instrumental.


94
The groundwork for such an understanding had in fact previously been laid by the
Frankfurt School. As is well known, the basic contention of the `critical theory' developed
by Max Horkheimer, Theodor Adorno, Herbert Marcuse is that technological rationality,
once a powerful lever for humanity's liberation from want and superstition, has now itself
become oppressive. In the "dialectic of the enlightenment," means have usurped ends, the
domination of nature has become the domination of man (sic), and the forces of production
have turned to forces of destruction.48 Enabled by its technoscientific powers both to
generate endless desires and also to fulfil them, capital exercises a control so
comprehensive as to produce Marcuse's "one dimensional man"--a subject incapable of
thinking, or even perceiving, beyond the limits of the system.49
Although the best work of the Frankfurt School and their colleagues predated the
enunciation of post-industrial theory, their critique of science and technology both
anticipated the developments Bell and his colleagues so enthusiastically embraced, and
coloured an entire line of post-war neo-Marxist response to computers and
telecommunications. As the information revolution intensified in pace during the 1970s and
1980s, their analysis of technology-as-domination was extended by a variety of theorists,
some following in the steps of Marcuse and his colleagues, others tracking back more
directly to Marx. This project developed in two streams--one focussed on the labour
process, the other exploring the mass media.
The seminal statement of the labour process stream is Harry Braverman's study of
the "degradation of work"--- a direct reply to the post-industrial claims of progress toward
a new and technologically improved era of labour relations.50 Basing himself firmly in
Marx's analysis of the labour process, Braverman argues that the `scientific management'


95
initiated by Frederick Winslow Taylor at the turn of the twentieth century, with its
separation of conception from execution, managerial monopolisation of knowledge and
systematic destruction of skills, is a manifestation of the "great truth of capitalism," namely
"that the worker must become the instrument of labour in the hands of the capitalist."51
However cosmetically disguised, this remains the dominant philosophy of twentieth
century management.
The rise of `white collar' work cited by Bell as evidence of an enlightened post-
industrial society is for Braverman simply a symptom of the enlarging managerial
apparatus of administration, supervision and planning. Similarly, the new "intellectual
technology" of computers and communications which post-industrialists expected to usher
in an era of skilled and satisfying mental work, for Braverman signals a precisely contrary
tendency. Whether in the movement of a factory worker following the pace of a pre-
programmed tool or the monitored keystrokes of an office secretary, the power of the new
technologies to record, store and reproduce activities previously dependent on embodied
consciousness yields only another extension of Taylorist authority. In the hands of scientific
management, machinery is seized upon as "the prime means whereby production may be
controlled not by the direct producer but by the owners and representatives of capital."52
This critique of the computerised labour process has subsequently been developed
in a number of studies.53 Perhaps the most influential is David Noble's work on numerically
controlled machine tools--technology central to the vision of the `workerless factory.'54
Noble argues that the drive to automate machining cannot be explained solely by the
requirements of a purely technical efficiency but is marked by the managerial imperative to
gain total control over the shop floor, and in particular to break the power of skilled,


96
unionised machinists. This is demonstrated by the suppression of technological options that
would allow workers an element of control over the newly automated processes. Noble
shows that even when this participation might have improved the operations of the system--
by allowing for revision of programmed instructions according to circumstances --the
managerial desire to eliminate the human element prevailed. Indeed, the whole thrust of
capital's use of information technology in the workplace is, Nobel argues, fundamentally
anti-human, predicated on a model of "progress without people."55
The other strand of the technology-as-domination school is that devoted to the
media and communication. In an enormously important move beyond the factory focus so
apparent in the work of classical Marxists such as Mandel, Adorno and Horkheimer had
argued that the subordination of society to capital is largely the work of the "culture
industry"--the entertainment and advertisement conglomerates which create artificial needs,
distract dissent, and endlessly endorse the existing order.56 Subsequently, broadly Marxian
scholars such as Herbert Schiller, Vincent Mosco, Dallas Smythe and Nicholas Garnham
have deepened this analysis with detailed research into the operations of the capitalist
media.57 In doing so, they have produced an analysis much more fine-grained than the
Frankfurt School’s, and sometimes considerably more nuanced in its recognition of
possibilities for resistance.58 Nonetheless, the overall emphasis of these writers falls
heavily on capitalism's technological power,  producing a picture of domination almost as
sombre as that discovered on the shopfloor, but expanded over a vastly greater sphere.
Here the work of Schiller can be taken as exemplary.59 Explicitly targeting theorists
who claim we are witnessing the transcendence of capital in "an individualised, electronic
global commune," he has consistently argued that what is occurring is rather a push toward


97
a "corporate-controlled information society."60 Focussing on the US situation, Schiller
shows how in all areas of information technology--hardware, software, and transmission
networks--the flux of innovation follows a path of relentless commodification. The new
satellites, fibre optics and computer networks are deployed to create a media explosion
whose apparent pluralism is belied by the near total absorption of thousands of
newspapers, magazines, radio stations, TV channels and cable systems into a few giant
media combines.
From ownership flows ideological control. Implicitly following the classic Marxist
logic by which economic base must determine ideational superstructure, Schiller insists
that corporate domination of communications industries yields a prodigious power over the
formation of popular consciousness. While information society theorists claim that a
proliferation of technologies and channels democratises and diversifies opinion formation,
Schiller argues that the giant media corporations generate, filter and refine the flows of
imagery, news and entertainment to exclude anything that might subvert the interest of
owners or advertisers and to systematically intensify the commodification of social
relations.
"The consequence," says Schiller, echoing Marcuse," is a national discourse that is
increasingly one dimensional."61 Although he allows for contradictions produced by
conflict within and amongst media industries or between such industries and other sectors
of capital, the overwhelming weight of his analysis points to the "systematic envelopment
of human consciousness by corporate speech."62 And since information technologies are
seen as a central instrument in this envelopment, the assessment of them is comprehensively
negative:


98
It is not a question of "either-or". . . good technology or bad technology use.
It is solely a matter of developing and using the new communication
technology for holding on to the economic benefits derived from a world
system of power. . . insistence on the potential and positive features of the
current communication instrumentation is disingenuous at best.63
"Mind management" in the cultural sphere becomes thus the corollary of deskilling and in
the workplace.64
These two streams of technology-as-domination analysis--one focussed on the
labour process and the other on the media--are melded by Frank Webster and Kevin
Robins in their relentlessly bleak account of "cybernetic capitalism."65 This makes explicit
the connection of Taylorism with media management. Taylorism, Webster and Robins point
out, was in its original formulation not only a doctrine of shop floor control but also an
overall social philosophy which pursued increasing productivity as "the key to future
prosperity, harmony and progress."66 The deployment of information technology represents
the realisation of this second phase of "generalised or social Taylorism," extending
capitalist control of knowledge and information beyond the factory to society as a whole.67
Confronting this prospect, Webster and Robins articulate the deep foreboding
characteristic of so much contemporary Marxian analysis of technology :
 This . . . is what we foresee in the future: a society in which corporate
capital, using the most advanced forms of I.T. that have been designed to
suit its requirements and constantly talking about the imperatives and
promises of a technological revolution, extends and consolidates its hold in


99
society, strengthening its control over employees (and shedding significant
numbers) while intruding further into the everyday lives of consumers both
groups of whom it observes, analyses and schemes about what changes
might be to the company's advantage and perceived as inevitable--by those
likely to suffer from restructuring--or desirable--by those able to pay the
going rate. Behind, often in front, and almost always in collusion with this
centralised corporate capital, is arraigned a disciplinary state, equipped
with the latest surveillance technologies, able to contain dissent from those
minorities unwilling to accede to the market's control or unable, through
unemployment and/or poverty, to participate in its technologies of
abundance.68
The changes presented by information revolutionaries as liberatory thus signify something
quite opposite--greater reach for the `visible hand' of managerial control, now exercised
through an arsenal of devices for broadcasting, monitoring and surveillance to allow the
observation and shaping of social subjects as both workers and customers.
Although scientific socialists, like Mandel, had always condemned the uses to
which capital puts technology, this critique of the technology-as-domination cut much
deeper. For scientific socialists, machines are neutral, although capital's deployment of
them is objectionable. For technology-as-domination theorists, however, this apparent
neutrality is a lie. Technologies embody social choices made by those with power over
their construction. Political intentions are present not only at the level of use, but of


100
research and construction--not merely in what is done with machines, but in how they are
designed, and, indeed, in whether potential innovations are realised at all or suppressed.
The thought that technology might, in its very core, incarnate the intentions of the
capitalists who make them, while certainly present in Marx, was first enlarged on by the
Frankfurt School theorists--who nevertheless clung, somewhat self-contradictorily to the
hope that technological rationality might be rescued from capital's grasp. But in the
subsequent development of this line of thought, the redemptive hope largely fades. In a flat
contradiction of scientific socialism's technological optimism, machines are seen as
buttressing rather than overturning established power. Noble says:
Technology . . . is not an irreducible first cause; its social effects follow
from social causes that brought it into being; behind the technology that
affects social relations lie the very same social relations. Little wonder,
then, that the technology usually tends to reinforce rather than subvert those
relations.69
Increasingly technological development comes to be seen as so deeply tainted by drives
toward domination and omnipotence as to constitute a social pathology--a madness to be
resisted at all costs.70
From such a position, it is natural that many technology-as-domination theorists
look for inspiration to the machine wreckers of the first Industrial Revolution--the
Luddites. For Noble, Webster and Robins the pejorative use of this epithet by information
revolutionaries slanders the real nature of a movement which represented a coherent
protest against destructive industrialisation advanced under the banner of technological
necessity. And, just as in the first industrial revolution capital accumulated itself through


101
popular immiseration, so the computerised `second industrial revolution' will expand
corporate wealth and control by massive dislocation, deskilling, and unemployment. What
is required to confront this prospect is a revival of the resistant spirit of General Ludd--a
neo-Luddism for the information age.71
Thus for Noble "the essence of technology question today" is that "there is a war
on, but only one side is armed."72 Notions of technological transcendence peddled by
information society theorists are no more than legitimations for the corporate assault on
workers. Given capital's control of research and innovation, the immediate possibility of
shaping and humanising the approaching wave of technological change is minimal. Rather,
leftist energies should be directed toward an immediate effort at halting, or at least
drastically slowing, its diffusion. Pointing to the actual incidence of sabotage amongst
people replaced by computers, Noble declares that " if workers have begun to smash the
physical machinery of domination <then> responsible intellectuals must begin to
deliberately smash the mental machinery of domination.”73
Of all the positions examined in this chapter, this neo-Luddite stance seems to me
the most insightful. It is the one that most fully confronts the ambition of the information
society project, not as a foreordained ascent of civilisation, but as a strategy of societal
power. This theoretical perspective is backed with concrete studies of the shaping of new
technologies to capitalist ends, both in the workplace and beyond it. And the consequent
call for resistance has an integrity lacking in the obeisances paid by scientific socialists
and social democrats alike to capitalist `progress.'
However, such analysis also has serious and ultimately self-defeating limitations.
At root this is because the technology-as-domination school overestimate capital's capacity


102
to command living labour with dead labour. It restores the human subject whom objective
Marxism banishes, but it introduces this subject primarily as victim. In this respect, the
reproach often levelled against Braverman's labour process analysis--that it sees workers
only as the passive objects of capitalist designs, and ignores the consequences of their
counter-strategies and resistances--is justified. So too are the criticisms made of media
analysts who acknowledge audiences only as the cultural dupes of advertisers. On both
fronts, capitalism's intentions and its capacities are too easily equated--a conflation which
Stewart Ewen has rightly criticised for its belief in "the self-generating potency of . . .
technology and domination."74
The more persuasively such analysis demonstrates the complete instrumentality of
technoscience to capital, the harder it becomes to credibly posit opposition or alternative.
This of course is precisely where the Frankfort School encountered a fatal self-
contradiction. For if technological dominance was in fact as total as Adorno or
Horkheimer suggested, it became difficult to explain even the basis for their own critical
viewpoint, let alone how it could possibly mobilise political action. Critical theory
relentlessly painted itself into a corner, where hope could only be sustained at the price of
heroic inconsistency. This dilemma is repeated by many later theorists, in whose portrait of
techno-capitalism revolutionary possibility gives way to dystopian nightmares of
indoctrination, surveillance and robotisation. The result is a radical pessimism that, while
certainly puncturing the euphoria of information society theory, also concedes its hegemony
over the future.
The problem is only partially addressed by the neo-Luddite theorists. In reviving
the figure of the machine-smasher their analyses vigorously reassert the active capacity of


103
capital's subjects--but only in a reactive mode. Such defensiveness can end in the
romanticisation of forms of labour which are either already manifestly dehumanising, or,
alternatively, which represent islands of relative privilege (the tendency of labour process
analysts to focus on the predicament of highly skilled male workers is a case in point.)
Further, it can take little account of the possibility--particularly apparent in the field of
media and communication technologies--that capital's labouring subjects may find real use-
values, perhaps even subversive ones, for the new technologies.
Ultimately, this position suffers the deficiencies of all oppositional theories that
conceive struggle only as resistance, and not as counter-initiative. Most neo-Luddite
authors in fact admit the need to eventually develop perspectives not just of resistance, but
of reappropriation.75 But the theoretical optic they have so powerfully developed cannot
really register such possibilities. For if capital does possess such entire, unilateral powers
to implant its logic into technologies as neo-Luddites assert, then efforts to recapture these
systems or turn them to alternative use are foredoomed.
It should be noted that although such critiques often begin with a rediscovery of
Marx, they frequently end with a repudiation of him. For the more strongly Marx's writings
on technology as domination are emphasised, the greater the inclination to dismiss or regret
his equally undeniable assertions about its liberatory potentials. Although Marx was
clearly sympathetic to the Luddites, he was also critical of them --remarking that
. . . it took time and experience before the workers learnt to distinguish
between machinery and its employment by capital, and transfer their attacks
from the material instruments of production to the form of society which
utilises these instruments.76


104
For many neo-Luddites, such comments only show how deeply Marxism was mortgaged to
bourgeois ideas of progress, and its inadequacy to the current crisis. However, in their
justified attacks on scientific socialism neo-Luddites have in fact discarded something
critical in Marx's vision--his understanding of technological development as a
contradictory process yielding countervailing possibilities for contending agencies. To
affirm and extend this latter strand, we need theory which, without reverting to the
automatism of scientific socialism, can find in technological knowledge empowerment not
just for capital, but for those who fight against it.
 Post-Fordism: New Times?
The discovery of such a perspective has, however, been complicated by the
emergence of yet another line of Marxian analysis, one moving in an almost diametrically
opposite direction from neo-Luddism. If this line also leads eventually to a departure from
Marxism, it takes its exit by an opposite door: one marked not by despair at the oppressive
power of capital's new technologies but by enchantment with their liberatory potentials.
And if this tendency marks a return to a `positive' Marxian attitude towards technology, it is
one very different from the revolutionary teleology of scientific socialism. For what it
looks forward to is not the inevitable victory of socialism, but the technological
reconciliation of workers with capital.
Much of this analysis has marched under the banner of `post-Fordism.' This is a
phrase that has entered a diversity of  theoretical positions. Not all analysis that uses the
term shares the spirit of compromise that I discuss here: for example, the work of David
Harvey and several of the radical geographers who have followed in his footsteps is very


105
different in tone.77  My remarks here should therefore not be taken as a total rejection of
the concept. Indeed, later in this work I sometimes `post-Fordism’ as a convenient label to
designate recent changes in the way capitalism  operates. Nevertheless, here I want to
focus on the way in which a certain version of `post-Fordism’  has become widely
associated with a perspective that brings neo-Marxian analysis surprisingly close to that of
liberal academics, management consultants, and, indeed, to the positions of the information
society theorists.
To understand this process, it is necessary to look at one of the roots of the post-
Fordist idea, in the work of the French 'Regulation School' of political economy. In what
seemed in origin a classic Marxian project, theorists such as Michel Aglietta and Alain
Lipietz set out to investigate the conditions governing the surprisingly successful and
ongoing reproduction of contemporary capitalist society. Capitalism, they proposed, is
neither an historically invariant formation, nor one teleologically destined to collapse.
Rather, it repeatedly overcomes internal contradictions by generating successive "regimes
of accumulation"--intermeshed orderings of wage relations, consumption norms, and state
intervention which synchronise the overall social prerequisites for the extraction and
realisation of surplus-value.78 Consolidation of such a regime depends on the successful
development of a "mode of regulation" based on "the institutional forms, procedures and
habits which either coerce or persuade private agents to conform to its schema,"79 and also,
in some later versions of the theory, on its integration of a viable "industrial paradigm," or
technological system of production.80
The principal application of this theoretical perspective has been to develop the
category of `Fordism.' Fordism of course takes its name from the integration of a Taylorist


106
division of labour with intense mechanisation pioneered in the auto-plant assembly lines of
Henry Ford. Inspired by Antonio Gramsci's fragmentary but suggestive essay
"Americanism and Fordism," Regulation School theorists expanded the meaning of the term
to designate the regime of accumulation characteristic of industrial capitalism during the
middle period of the twentieth century.81 Fordism in this sense was a comprehensive
system of social organisation, coordinating factory-based assembly-line production, mass
markets consuming standardised manufactured goods, and Keynesian stabilisation of the
business cycle. Under Fordism, capital enjoyed its post-World War II "Golden Age."
But in the late 1960s and early 1970s, the Regulation School argues, Fordism
encountered a serious crisis. Their accounts of its causes vary in the writings of various
theorists--ranging through a saturation of mass markets, shopfloor disaffection, the fiscal
costs of the welfare state, and changing conditions of global competition. Often these
factors are combined in an impeccably overdetermined account. But in any event,
Regulation School theorists agree that, starting about twenty five years ago, capital's most
successful regime of accumulation began to falter; sliding profit rates inaugurated a period
of continuing flux and uncertainty, disintegration and restructuring in the global economy
that continues to this day.
If Fordism is breaking up, the obvious issue is: what will succeed it ? This is the
question theories of a `post-' or `neo-' Fordist regime attempt to answer. While accounts of
the emergent regime vary in detail, it is generally agreed that it will centrally involve the
introduction of new technologies--a change in "industrial paradigm." Aglietta himself
speculated that a "neo-Fordist" regime would replace the "mechanical principle" of the
assembly line with computerised systems based on the "informational principle."82His


107
view of such developments was far from rosy: while their arrival unleashed "the most
shameless propaganda about the liberation of man in work," they actually meant intensified
workplace deskilling and, at the level of society as a whole "a strong totalitarian
tendency."83 Some theorists drawing on his work retain this sceptical orientation. But
others have elaborated the idea of post- Fordism far more optimistically.
 
Here the Regulation School's Marxism intersects in a remarkable way with non-,
indeed anti-Marxist, perspectives. One of the most important of these is the work of
Michael Piore and Charles Sabel on the "second industrial divide."84 Piore and Sabel, far
from being Marxists, are, if anything, Proudhonist in their orientation--fascinated by the
prospects of escaping the alienation of modern capitalism by return to small-scale,
cooperative, artisanal production.85 For these theorists, the disintegration of Fordism
amounts to a moment equivalent in importance to the first industrial revolution. On the
other side of this divide lie bright prospects. Information technologies possess a
reprogrammability that gives them a plasticity unknown to dedicated industrial machinery.
This, Piore and Sabel argue, will allow the restoration to the workplace of the judgement,
learning and variety lost to Taylorism.
New computerised systems of "flexible specialisation" can both respond to the
disaggregation of standardised Fordist mass consumption into more fluid, niched and
customised markets and at the same time supersede the deadening routine of Fordist mass
production.86 The monotony of the industrial assembly line will give way to versatile high-
tech craft work that requires the willing engagement of the operator's knowledge and
attention and places a premium on cooperation between management and worker. The
result Piore and Sabel claim, will be to dissolve the alienation and antagonism of the


108
capitalist workplace and lay the basis for a new, artisanal, computerised post-Fordist
"yeoman democracy."87
By the mid 1980s, the production of such optimistic post-Fordist prophecies had
become a veritable academic industry.The concept of a new regime of accumulation was
variously married with theories of flexible specialisation, Japanese management or
Swedish humanised workplaces to generate a series of predictive models of labour/
capital cooperation in the new epoch.88 With their promise of a new era pivotally shaped
by computers and telecommunications, these versions of post-Fordism triggered memories
amongst both critics and supporters of post-industrialism and information society theory.
Indeed, for its proponents on the left, one of the attractions of the concept was undoubtedly
that it represented a rejoinder to such theories. It seemed to offer a way of talking about
computers that did not pretend capitalism had ceased to exist, yet did not box itself into the
relentless pessimism of theories of technology-as-domination.89 Yet in doing so, it often
replicated the most problematic aspects of post-industrial theory. For, as Pelaez and
Holloway point out in their scathing attack on theories of post-Fordism, in many of these
accounts the complexity of Aglietta's original analysis of the crisis of Fordism is simplified
into a blunt technological determinism whereby it is the sheer force of new technologies
that produces the new era.90
A more sophisticated version of the argument--strongly advanced by Lipietz, a
founder and foremost populariser of Regulation School theory--is that the crisis of Fordism
opens the way to a variety of alternative accumulation regimes. Some of these would be
better for workers than others. One could have either neo-Fordist regimes--in which
informatics duplicate and intensify traditional patterns of exploitation--or truly post-Fordist


109
systems, which take advantage of the new technological opportunities for reskilling and
responsibility. For Lipietz, the pursuit of this latter path, the search for a "a way out of the
crisis" based on "responsible involvement," in which workers gain higher security, higher
pay, and/or shorter hours in return for their cooperation in post-Taylorist high technology
systems represents "the dream of a new deal for the 21st century."91
However, many critics have suggested that such dreams of a high-tech "new deal"
rest on a very uncritical acceptance of management propaganda about new production
systems. Post-Fordist analysis, they charge, de-emphasises the way "flexible
specialisation" segments the workforce between a `core' of permanent skilled workers and
a `periphery' of casualised and temporary employees.92 It also often glosses over how,
even within this `core,' the new post-Taylorist work organisation, with its `autonomous
work teams,' peer policing, and internalised competition have been developed as an attack
on trades union strength.93 Morover, its customary contrasts between dirty assembly lines
and clean computers ignores the reality of stress, repetitive strain injuries, eye strain, and
electronic sweatshops.
 
To this I would add that many theorists of post-Fordism are remarkably silent about
the way automation and global communication have been deployed to swell the reserve
army of the unemployed, in a way that ferociously undercuts the strength of movements
struggling for improved conditions of work and life. Even where these negative features of
restructuring are recognised in `post-Fordist' analysis, as they are in some of Lipietz's
work, they are seen as contingent options, undesirable alternatives within an array of social
options. What is not confronted is the possibility identified by neo-Luddite analysts,
namely that these destructive outcomes might not be subsidiary to capital's logic, but rather


110
central to it --that post-Fordist restructuring might be a project predicated on discipline
through austerity as a prerequisite for future profit. In this view, the weakening of
resistance, on the shopfloor and in society at large, is a central purpose in the corporate
deployment of new technologies, and the chances of negotiating a "new deal" around their
use are thus probably illusory.
This tendency to downplay the darker side of capitalist restructuring is even more
apparent when post-Fordism has entered discussions on media and popular culture. Just as
in the the labour process debate the post-Fordist cachet often marked a shift away from
pessimism about the degradation of work toward post-Taylorist optimism, so in the field of
culture it has been associated with a rejection of sombre theories of mind-management in
favour of an effervescent enthusiasm for `popular culture.' A salient example is the concept
of `New Times' proposed in the British journal Marxism Today by a cluster of authors
including Stuart Hall, Dick Hebdige, Robin Murray and John Urry.94 In the New Times
analysis the switch from standardised mass consumption to flexible specialisation is seen
as bringing with it an intensified attention to advertising, design, fashion, media and market
information. This generates a postmodern ambience of sliding signifiers, simulacra and
spectacle, a culture whose volatility and recombinancy both reflects and contributes to the
fluidity of post-Fordist production systems.95
However, in marked contrast to theorists such as Schiller, New Times analysts do
not view this explosion of media and imagery with suspicion or alarm. Rather, the new
scope of consumer choice--including the proliferation of media channels--and the energetic
experimentation of post-Fordist commercial culture, with its gender-bending
advertisements, socially conscious products, global eclecticism and self conscious


111
embrace of feminism and multiculturalism, are seen as opening an exciting space replete
with possibilities for the forms of life championed in various identity politics. Hall speaks
of the disintegration of Fordism catalyzing a "revolution of the subject," and creating an
"expansion in the positionalities and identities available to ordinary people."96 Exhorting
the left to adapt to the pluralising, decentralising and variegating aspect of the new cultural
regime he cites Marx's famous lines about the dynamic effects of "the constant
revolutionising of production" in which "all fixed, fast frozen relationships . . . are swept
away . . . All that is solid melts away."
In the eyes of critics such as A. Sivanandan, however, what has melted away in the
enthusiasm for post-Fordism is the solidity of Marxist commitments.97 Even more moderate
critics voiced concerns that the "designer socialism" of Hall and his colleagues expressed
the limited perspectives of a fraction of left intelligentsia favoured by the growth of new
cultural industries, and that their enthusiasm for "new times" was achieved only at the
expense of forgetting about "old enemies."98 And indeed, the New Times celebrations of
post-Fordism's cultural vivacity seem remarkably indifferent to the appearance in
Thatcherite Britain of new exclusions and stratification at least as pernicious as the
massified divisions of Fordism. Eloquent about the improved choices post-Fordism brings
to consumers, it was very silent on the street-level bricolage left for those destituted by the
degradation of the welfare state. When this is taken together with an evident distaste for the
militancies of miners' strikes or anti-poll tax riots, a politics hovering vaguely on the left of
a Labour Party marching rapidly to the right, and a theoretical rapprochement with
specifically `post-Marxist ' theorists, it is difficult not to think that the New Times analysis
made the title of Marxism Today into a very postmodern irony.


112
Distaste for such positions has led many Marxists to entirely reject the categories of
Fordism and post-Fordist as a mystification of capital's perennial, and ugly, features. This
may be to throw the baby out with the bathwater. The argument that capital entered a phase
of drastic restructuring in the early 1970s is a compelling one. In recognising this shift,
theorists who use the category of post-Fordism have often been more alert to important
changes in work, culture, and politics than their more orthodox Marxist critics. They could
even be said to have rediscovered a sense of the dynamic, tumultuous and experimental
nature of capitalist development that was salient in Marx's own writings, but is often
forgotten by those who insist that capital is always 'the same old thing.'99
However, to agree with the post-Fordists that capitalism is undergoing a period of
rapid change is not to assent to their analysis of the cause, course or consequence of this
transformation. As Julie Graham has pointed out, embedded within the theoretical
apparatus of the Regulation School is a deep tendency to downplay the conflict at the heart
of capitalist society.100 For their analysis takes as its focus and "point of entry" the
requirements for capital's successful organisation of society, not the contestation of its
rule.101 Its research agenda is built around capitalist growth, not class struggle. Once such
study is divorced from scientific socialists' teleology of inevitable breakdown, it tacitly
enters onto the same ground as non- or anti-Marxist theories of economic development, so
that "Marxism becomes another theory of capitalist growth, focusing primarily on those
social processes that promote capital accumulation and excluding those that do not."102 The
result, as Graham notes, is a vision that is premised on the "vitality and uncontested
hegemony" of capital's reproduction, but "obscures the weaknesses and instabilities of that


113
process (and) hides the failures and unevenness that make non-capitalist alternatives an
existing and future option."103
This emphasis on the historical adaptability of capital, taken in conjunction the
general demoralisation of the left in the 1980s, has led to a very rapid acceptance that what
will emerge from the crisis of Fordism can only be another capitalist regime of
accumulation. The assumption that restructuring will succeed--an inverse reflection of
scientific socialism's faith in inevitable collapse--leads, by gradual but inexorable stages,
to a circumscription of left action. Even in the work of Lipietz, shrewdest and most
persuasive of post-Fordist reformists, it is impossible not to be struck by how emphatically
socialism is ruled off the agenda for the foreseeable future, how complete is the acceptance
of the hegemony of the market, or how large the concessions to the corporate agenda for the
reorganisation of work. The only issue becomes what sort of capitalist regime will emerge,
and how good a "deal" workers and social movements can cut within it.
This effects what Les Levidow has termed a "foreclosure of the future."104 By
implicitly accepting the success of capital's restructuring it directs attention away from
forms of action which might challenge that completion. It shuts the door on strategies where
workers' knowledge of new production systems yield, not partnership with management,
but new ways to challenge managerial command, and new ways in which emergent media
networks are made to circulate struggles rather than commodities. In doing so, it represses
radical potentialities in favour of reformist hopes.105 This is done in the name of realism.
But given the enormous offensive capacity the new technologies allow global business, the
expectation that capital will negotiate any reformist compromise unless faced with a
serious challenge to its overall control of society is itself utterly utopian. For Lipietz, the


114
task is "to find a way out of the crisis." But the Marxist project has never been to help
capitalism find a way out of crisis. It has been to find a way of capitalism. This is
precisely the possibility that much post-Fordist writing abdicates.
Condition Terminal?
In this chapter we have seen how various schools of Marxism have responded in
radically contrasting ways to the `information revolution.' This diversity of response arises
from the complexity of Marx's own writings on technology. The amplification and
extension of different aspects of these texts has given rise to very different perspectives on
the relation of machines to social change. Scientific socialism has conceived of a
teleological interaction of forces and relations of production, leading to the eventual
collapse of capital; technology-as-domination theorists, on the other hand, see machinery
as consolidating and deepening capitalist power; and post-Fordists have often found in
new technologies the promise of a humanisation of work which would transcend the
traditional patterns of exploitation.
All these accounts suffer major defects as a reply to the anti-Marxist challenge of
the information revolutionaries. In a way that uncannily mirrors the logic of their
opponents, scientific socialism effectively liquidates human agency, and substitutes for it
an inexorable, and ultimately sinister, technological automatism. Technology-as-
domination theorists restore to view the question of the subjectivity constituted by a
machine saturated society-- but can conceive of it only as a process of victimised
exploitation, to which the best response is a reactive, heroic, but probably hopeless neo-
Luddism. Many post-Fordist accounts, on the other hand have embraced so much of the
information revolutionaries own euphoria about the new subject of technology as to


115
essentially abdicate the negative moment of critique and subscribe to capital's own logic of
technological development.
Indeed, all three perspectives lead, although by different routes, to potential
disintegrations of or exits from Marxism: scientific socialism shattered by the confounding
of teleological optimism marked by the events of 1989; neo-Luddism descending into a
dystopian, radical pessimism; and several versions of post-Fordism converging with a
post-Marxist politics that claims to go `beyond' issues of capital and class. Surveying these
dead-ends, it would appear that the information age has put Marxism into a terminal
condition.

stripped of political implication, have been reabsorbed by post-industrial long-wave
theorists, with their visions of ineffable economic cycles pulsing tidally across the
centuries. 'Long wave theorists' such as Christopher. Freeman and Carletta Perez

Peter Hall and Paschal Preston, The Carrier Wave: New Information Technology and the
Geography of Innovation, 1846-2003 (London: Unwin Hyman, 1988) base their work on
Kondratieff's theory of inexorable--albeit mysterious--economic cycles linked to clusters
of technological innovation and situate the emergence of computers and communications as
part of the new "techno-economic" paradigm marking the onset of "fifth Kondratieff." or
"carrier wave" about to unfold at the turn of the century (Hall and Preston 1988) While this
construction moderates claims of the scope of epochal change made by postindustrialists--
situating the microchip and fibre optic cable within a sequence of technological revolutions
whose predecessors include steam, steel processing, electricity --it retains the idea of
momentous technological change overtaking the contemporary world with inhuman
irresistibility.

105 This tendency appears even where supporters of the Regulation School believe they are
arguing most strongly for the 'radicalism' of their outlook. Thus Mark Ellam, "Puzzling Out
the Post-Fordist Debate: Technology, Markets and Institutions," Post-Fordism: A Reader,
ed. Ash Amin (Blackwell: Oxford, 1994) 66, contrasts the Regulation School with "neo-
Schumpeterean" and "neo-Smithian" approaches, and approves it because it "sees the new
rulebook of capitalist life as only partially written with room for many more coauthors." In
support of this, he asserts the insight that "In fact, strategic resistance against new
technology and the market may well be essential if a new period of stable capitalist growth


127
                                                                                                                                                
is to be secured." (orginal emphasis). This strikes us as the apogee of functionalist
recuperation: "strategic resistance" is defined by its role in consolidating accumulation.
