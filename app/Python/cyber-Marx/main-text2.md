Revolutions
Two Revolutions
On the eve of the twenty-first century the only revolution spoken of in advanced
capitalism is the information revolution. Few other ideas have proven so compelling for
people attempting to comprehend incessant and accelerating technological change in their
daily lives. Indeed, along with a number of synonymous or associated terms--`post-
industrialism,' `super-industrialism,' `the technetronic society,' `the wired society,' `the
control revolution,' `high technology society,' `the second industrial divide,' `post-Fordism,'
`the globalisation of technology'--the phrase `information revolution' has come to
profoundly define contemporary anxieties and hopes about the future. For, according to the
theorists of this revolution, the technoscientific knowledge crystallised in computers,
telecommunications, and biotechnologies is now unleashing an ongoing and irresistible
transformation of civilisation, dramatic in its consequences, unavoidably traumatic in the
short term, but opening onto horizons nothing short of utopian.
The development and content of the doctrine of information revolution have already
been given extensive critical analysis.1 But I want here to relate it to a different body of
revolutionary theory--one whose star has fallen, even as that of the information revolution
has risen: Marxism. Marxists have shared information revolutionaries' belief in the
profound social consequences of technoscientific change. But they have differed from them
in relating the dominative and liberatory potential of machines to the struggle between
labour and capital, and to another kind of revolution--communist revolution. No
propositions could today appear more fatally archaic. In the age of cyberspace, Lenin lies


27
in ruins. And many would say that the inverse trajectories of Marxism and the information
revolution--one ascending as the other declines--are causally connected. Marxism,
information revolutionaries claim, was unfit for the information age, doomed by allegiance
to a labour theory of value in an era of intelligent machines; by a base/superstructure model
of society blind to the significance of symbolic data; by a despotic statism that tried in vain
to repress irresistibly proliferating channels of communications; and by a concept of
revolution made obsolete by technological progress.
But if information revolutionaries have polemicised against Marxism, they have
also themselves claimed many characteristically Marxist themes--notions of `progress,' of
`materialism,' of `liberation' and, of course, of `revolution' itself. This common vocabulary
in part goes back to the Enlightenment heritage that the insurrectionary Marx shared with
technocratic utopians such as Babbage and Saint Simon, men whose schemes for a
perfected industrialism overseen by scientific experts are the forerunners of information
society theory.2 But it also has a more recent basis. Some of today's most prominent
information revolutionaries are themselves one-time Marxists, apostates who have drawn
heavily on their former beliefs even while developing a new creed. This chapter therefore
examines the information revolutionaries' hostile annexation of Marxism, showing how
they turn Marx against Marx in pursuit of a technologically altered world where
communism is neither possible nor necessary.
 From the End of Ideology to Post-Industrialism
Although it is only recently that the idea of `information revolution' has become
widely current, it is the immediate descendant of a concept of the late 1960s--post-


28
industrial society. But to understand the relation of both these theories to Marxism it is
necessary to look yet further back and glimpse behind the shoulder of post-industrialism the
shape of a yet earlier concept--that of the "end of ideology."3
In the late 1950s and early 1960s a number of intellectuals, surveying the
apparently calm and prosperous conditions of North American and European `industrial'
societies, suggested that these had reached a plateau of more or less permanent
stabilisation. Post-war affluence, the institutionalisation of collective bargaining, and the
welfare state had banished the class conflicts of an earlier era from the scene. Such
societies presented the successful socio-economic model, toward which other experiments,
including those in the `underdeveloped' and `socialist' world, would gradually converge.
This was the condition of the "end of ideology"--which meant, in general, an end of
alternatives to liberal capitalism, and, more specifically and pointedly, an end to Marxism
as a revolutionary force. Amongst the most eloquent spokesmen for this thesis was one
Daniel Bell, a rising young intellectual rapidly departing early Trotskyite flirtations on a
rightward trajectory which would eventually deliver him as a founding figure of American
neoconservatism.4
Few social theories have, however, had the misfortune to be as swiftly discredited
as the "end of ideology" thesis. Within a matter of years the appearance of peaceful,
passionless capitalist stability was spectacularly contradicted by the upsurge of domestic
and international dissent in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Industrial society--the
unsurpassable pinnacle of modernity, prosperity and technological advance--went into
paroxysm, its military machine stalled in the jungles of Vietnam; its urban ghettos burning
through successive summers; its huge automobile factories paralysed by labour conflict; its


29
university campuses in rebellion; its culture subverted by the music, drugs and politics of
youth revolt; its domestic arrangements and relation to nature shaken by nascent feminist
and ecological movements.
Bell's "second coming" as a prophet of post-industrialism can be understood as a
reaction to these events.5 Faced with the unexpected convulsions of `industrial society,'
many intellectuals sought explanations in the possibility that these tumults marked nothing
less than the growing pains associated with the emergence of a radically new social order.
Such notions were variously inflected, embracing both right and left variants. But the most
influential version, the one from which a direct line to today's concept of the information
revolution can be traced, arose amongst the think-tanks and sponsored research projects
offering futurological guidance for US state policy and corporate strategy.
From this context emerged ideas such as that of the "technological society" fostered
in Harvard's IBM-sponsored Program on Science and Technology (1971), the "knowledge
society" predicted by management guru Peter Drucker (1968), the "technetronic era"
described by soon-to-be US National Security advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski (1970), the
"year 2000" scenarios elaborated by Herman Kahn and Anthony Wiener out of the RAND
Corporation and the Hudson Institute (1967), and, most famously, the work of Bell, whose
The Coming of Post-Industrial Society, published in 1973 but expressing ideas which its
author had been developing since at least 1968, was to prove definitive of the entire
genre.6
Taking the US as the exemplar of future global developments, Bell argued that out
of the crises of his day was appearing a new type of "post-industrial" society, to be fully
visible "in the next thirty to fifty years."7 The principal motor of this post-industrial


30
transition was the increasingly systematised relationship between scientific discovery and
technological application, which was making theoretical knowledge society's central
wealth producing resource. Around this central axis of change were grouped a set of
loosely associated transformations: a shift from a goods producing to a service economy; a
move in occupational distribution away from manual labour to the pre-eminence of
professional and technical work; increasing capacities of assessment and forecasting; and a
new "intellectual technology" of games-theory and systems-analysis, materially embedded
in computer systems.8
The result would be a society "organised around knowledge for the purpose of
social control and the directing of innovation and change."9 The most important agents in
this post-industrial society would be scientists, engineers and administrators, a new
"knowledge class" lodged primarily within government and academia, bearers of the
rationalist skills and virtues required by increasing organisational and technological
complexity.10 Bell argued that the endeavours of this new class could create an epoch of
rationalised integration and prosperity-which, while not without its own problems, would
finally escape from the material want, economic crisis and class conflict of the industrial
era.
As he advanced this new position, Bell had firmly in mind the adversarial presence
of Marx. For although the upheavals of the late 60s challenged socialist parties and
governments as well as capitalist ones, they were undeniably shot through with the spirit of
the very revolutionary tradition that the "end of ideology" thesis had pronounced defunct.
Marx was present in the support for Vietnamese and Cuban guerrillas, in the theories of the
New Left, and in the slogans of workers and students in Paris, Turin and Detroit. The


31
Coming of Post-Industrial Society in fact opens with the image of Marx in the British
Museum hearing "in every faint sound of riot or each creaking downturn of the business
cycle the rumblings of revolution and the abrupt transformation of society."11 Saluting
Marx's work, Bell situates his own efforts in the same tradition of "social forecasting"--and
then launches into a sustained attack on Marxist claims that capitalist societies must
violently succumb to their internal contradictions.12
This rebuttal proceeds not by a simple rejection of Marx, but by an ingenious
recuperation.13 Bell proposes that there are actually two contradictory "schemas" in Marx's
analysis of capitalism. The first, best-known, is the "revolutionary" prediction of
sharpening class contradictions, market anarchy and deepening crisis contained in volume
one of Capital. The second, Bell claims, is suggested in the later volumes, and envisages a
quite different "rationalising" tendency, glimpsed by Marx but better understood by
theorists such as Max Weber, a tendency apparent in the separation of professional
management from capitalist ownership, the rise of a `middle' class, the bureaucratisation of
enterprise, and the spread of stockholding. This latter trend, Bell says, blurs and softens
class conflict. The history of the twentieth century is the story of the cancellation of the
former revolutionary prediction by the latter rationalising one---culminating in the advent
of post-industrial society.
Knowledge, says Bell in one of his most widely repeated formulations, will
replace both labour and capital as the main factor of production. Between the opposition of
capitalist and worker emerges a new class--"a professional class, based on knowledge
rather property."14 The rise of this new class follows a quasi-Marxian logic that relates the
emergence of new historical subjects to new forces of production, but effectively negates


32
its revolutionary force.15 Capital will be transformed by technical and administrative
experts, abandoning fixation with profit, becoming more socially responsible, and giving
"moral issues" equal priority with balance sheets.16 Labour too will be transfigured.
Technological development will raise living standards, automate manual toil and thereby
liquidate Marx's subject of history--the immiserated industrial proletariat. "If there is an
erosion of the working class in post-industrial society," Bell asks, posing the question all
information society theorists will subsequently hurl at Marxism, "how can Marx's vision of
social change be maintained?"17
Ultimately, in an ambivalence that persists throughout information society theory,
Bell equivocates as to whether this regime of scientific expertise peacefully transcends
capitalism or simply elevates it to a new level of stability and organisation.18 He toys with
the idea that the "knowledge class" will become a new ruling class, only to regretfully
retreat from this suggestion. But in any case its appearance is sufficient to nullify Marx's
prediction of war between capital and labour, smoothing the sharp edges of bipolar class
antagonism so as to make the idea of communist revolution a quaint anachronism.
The post-industrial prophecy thus projects into an imminent future the very
conditions of stabilisation which the "end of ideology" thesis had mistakenly declared
already achieved. As Krishan Kumar has pointed out, Bell and his colleagues, faced by the
revelation that contemporary society was not in fact fully pacified, responded by proposing
an extra stage to the march of progress.19 With the suitable application of expertise and
technology, the lingering problems would be cleared up once and for all around the year
2000.


33
Often, Bell speaks of this outcome with oracular certainty. Yet this tone is at odds
with another more urgent and combative element in his writings--condemnation, polemic,
warning. Rational progress--embodied in the technocratic state and its knowledge elite--is
under siege by the irrational protest by the New Left, student revolt, affirmative action
groups, and an "adversary culture."20 Only if the pilotage of society is entrusted to the
cadres of technical experts, scientists, engineers and administrators will chaos be avoided,
and the dawning era safely ushered in. No mere extrapolation from predetermined trends,
but a determined assertion of what those trends will be, post-industrial futurology foresees
the future it intends to make.
From Post-industrialism to the Information Society
In the late 1960s and early 70s such post-industrial theory enjoyed wide popularity
amongst academics, government experts and corporate managers. Nowhere was it more
avidly received than in Japan. There, translated texts by North American futurists were
reworked by authors such as Tadeo Umesao, Kenichi Kohyama, Yujiro Hayashi, and
Yoneji Masuda to produce the concepts of johoka shakai or joho shakai --'informational
society' or `information society.'21 According to Tessa Morris-Suzuki's study of Japanese
information society theory, joho shakai gave particular emphasis to computers' potential for
changing industrial production methods by introducing unprecedented levels of automation
and of integration between office, factory and consumer.22 At the same time, the content of
production was envisaged as becoming more `information intensive,' in the sense that


34
innovation, planning, design and marketing would represent an integral and increasing
share in the value of goods and services.
In the work of futurists such as Masuda these transformations were linked to an
idealistic vision of an emergent society in which increased availability of information and
free time resulted in declining materialism, improved self-actualisation, voluntary civic
participation, enhanced global and ecological consciousness, and, ultimately a revival of
spirituality--in short "computopia."23 But this concept of extensive computerisation also
entered the domain of public policy, sponsored by the powerful Ministry of International
Trade and Industry, as a hard-headed development strategy aimed at overcoming shortages
in labour and natural resources, securing international markets and remedying the
widespread social disaffection of the 1960s. The creation of an "information society"
became a centrepiece of Japanese economic planning.
In North America and Europe, interest in these ideas was accelerated by economic
recession, whose first tremors had appeared in the late 60s. Bell and his colleagues had
assumed an uninterrupted continuation of post-war rates of economic growth. But by the
mid-1970s this prediction was abruptly confounded as social disorder was met by
austerity, recession and economic crisis. However, as the West's leaders searched for
solutions to social economic malaise, their eyes turned to the `Japanese miracle'--only to
discover joho shakai as a strategy for computerisation, robotisation, workplace
reorganisation and systematic `softening' of the economy. Under this guise, post-
industrialism earned a new lease of life. In 1978, a conference of Japanese and US
communications scholars resulted in the publication of the first North American book to
use the term “information society” in its title.24


35
At the same time, related ideas were independently gaining currency on both sides
of the Atlantic. In 1977, the US Government's Office of Telecommunication published
Marc Porat's influential study of the "information economy" which suggested that an
increasing portion of GNP depended on "information activity" and a growing proportion of
jobs on "information work."25 In Europe, a broadly similar effect was produced by the
publication in 1978 of a French governmental report on computerisation, L'Informatisation
de la Societie, by Simon Nora and Alain Minc.26 This argued that the convergence of
computers and telecommunications--which they termed "telematics"--would alter "the
entire nervous system of social organisation."27 In the light of this transformation, national
well-being depended on the fostering of domestically based high-technology industries,
and the computerisation of the operations of government.
Thus by the late 1970s, the `information revolution' was emerging as a central
category in government and corporate planning. In 1979 Bell recast his original post-
industrial thesis in the new, fashionable terms, emphasising the importance of computer and
telecommunication networks and speaking of an "information explosion" constituted by:
. . . a set of reciprocal relations between the expansion of science, the
hitching of that science to a new technology, and the growing demand for
news, entertainments and instrumental knowledge, all in the context of
rapidly increasing population, more literate and more educated, living in a
vastly enlarged world that is now tied together, almost in real time, by
cable, telephone and international satellite, whose inhabitants are made
aware of each other by the vivid pictorial imagery of television, and that
has at its disposal large data banks of computerised information.28


36
This statement was simultaneous with and succeeded by a spate of similar academic
studies; by best selling popularisations such as Alvin Toffler's The Third Wave and John
Naisbett's Megatrends ; by a burgeoning business literature devoted to managing in the
information age; and by journalistic coverage of the type which made the microcomputer
Time's "Person of the Year" for 1982.29 All of this translated theories of the information
revolution into a popular idiom of the 1980s.
These theories revamped the post-industrial vision of epochal transition, giving it
glossier sheen, leaner design, and enhanced computing power. Post-industrialism had
primarily defined the new era in terms of its departure from the crises of industrialism.
Information society theory gives this shift a more substantial content: industry is succeeded
by information. The borderline between eras is that dividing mechanical from digital
machines, steel mills from silicon chips, railroads from communication networks. Post-
industrialist technocracy, moreover, had worn the mark of an attachment to governmental
bureaucracy. Information revolution, more attuned to the climate of Thatcherism and
Reaganism, dispenses with this. Technocracy is replaced by high-tech, organisation men by
intelligent machines, experts by expert systems, intelligentsia by artificial intelligences,
mainframes by microcomputers, pyramidal hierarchies by distributed systems, central
office by cyberspace.30
In this form, the idea of an information revolution--a revolution simultaneously
inevitable and desirable--became a crucial intellectual and rhetorical component in a
project of high-technology restructuring pursued collaboratively by state and corporate
sectors throughout the advanced capitalist world.31 For corporations, the image of an
approaching information age provided a slogan to accompany the robotising of factories,


37
automating of offices, selling of cable television, and marketing of microcomputers, new
media and on-line services. For government, the approach of the information society was
invoked to justify public subsidisation of corporate high-technology research, the forging of
academic-business partnerships, the deregulation of phone companies, and the privatisation
of telecommunications and other information utilities in the public domain.
Those who propounded its doctrine--political leaders, corporate executives, state
bureaucrats, research scientists, academic theorists, journalistic popularisers--did not
merely describe the future. They prescribed it. Although the arrival of the new epoch was
declared inevitable, definite steps were demanded to adjust to its realities, hurry its
benefits, pre-empt its problems, and secure positional advantage within it. These included
massive investment in new machines, vast restructurings of work and unemployment, the
stimulation of new markets, the inculcation of unfamiliar leisure habits and cultural forms,
the reorganisation of research, education and training, the treatment of technophobia and the
crushing of `Luddism.' The proffered choice was adaptation or obsolescence. And insofar
as such exhortation did indeed result in a deepening social commitment to, and dependence
on, information technologies, it secured for itself the virtuous circularity of self-fulfilling
prophecy--generating the reality it predicted.32
Revolutionary Doctrine
Theories of the information revolution are not all the same. At each stage in the
unfolding of the doctrine advocates of the most recent version urge the novelty of their
position and distance it from the preceding one. There are also substantial differences
within each generation of the argument, as well as significant variations of tone between its
various academic, popular and official registers.33 Nonetheless, the principle claims of the


38
information revolutionaries can be summarised in seven points of `revolutionary
doctrine.'34
1. The world is in the midst of a transition to a new stage of civilisation, a
transition comparable to the earlier shift from agrarian to industrial society. In this
transition computers and telecommunications play a role equivalent to the steam engine and
railroad in the 19th century. Underlying this idea is a powerful technological determinism.
Masuda writes:
When epoch-making technological innovation occurs, changes take place in
the existing society and a new society emerges. The steam engine
precipitated the industrial revolution, bringing about the changes that lead
to a new economic and political system . . . The information epoch resulting
from computer-communication technology will bring about a societal
transformation just as great or even greater than the industrial revolution.35
Other accounts acknowledge that the effects of technology on society are not immediate,
nor the interaction entirely unidirectional. But the overall tenor of the argument is usually
that machines are the real makers of social change. The transformative effects of
information technologies are usually conceived of as becoming visible in the 1960s,
although originating earlier, starting in developed economies--Japan, the US, and other
OECD countries--and proceeding at an accelerating rate and with expanding scope as we
approach the millennium, moving on a trajectory that is basically benign, eventually
universal, and certainly unavoidable--the latest phase in the march of progress.
2. The crucial resource of the new society is technoscientific knowledge. While
technological innovation is understood to have always been the critical factor in societal


39
transformation, the distinguishing mark of the current epoch is generally held to be the
direct harnessing of scientific research to this process. Whereas previously scientific
discovery and technological application proceeded with relative independence and only
sporadic intersection, now the pure knowledge of science can no longer be sharply
distinguished from its practical realisation in technology. Science and technology are so
institutionally integrated as to fuse in a single operation, which Bell designated by the
phrase "research and development " and is more recently signified as "technoscience."36
The result is what Drucker calls a "knowledge society," or what Alvin and Heidi Toffler
term a "powershift" whereby "both force and wealth themselves have come to depend on
knowledge."37
3. The principle manifestation and prime mover of the new era is the invention and
diffusion of information technologies--that is, technologies which transfer, process, store
and disseminate digitalised data: computers, telecommunications, and, by some accounts,
biotechnology. Information revolutionaries point to the extraordinarily swift and broad
development each of these fields of informatics has undergone since 1945--computers
passing through successive generations, each of smaller size, larger capacity and higher
speed; telecommunications moving from analogue to digital signals, and adopting new
switching and transmission methods which dramatically improve performance, reliability,
and costs; biotechnology advancing from the initial discoveries of DNA and RNA to
everyday in-vitro fertilisation and transgenic species creation. Information revolutionaries
anticipate that this pace of innovation will not only continue, but accelerate at an
exponential rate.


40
Moreover, they point out, the real power of information technologies lies not so
much in their independent capacities, but rather in the fact that their common digital
language permit the convergence of their discrete capabilities into increasingly powerful,
combined, synergistic technological systems. Thus the full potential of communications and
computer technologies only emerges at their confluence into a single stream of
`compunications,' `telematics,' `computer mediated communication,' or `intelligent
networks,' enabling the creation of on-line data bank, email services and global computer
connectivity. There are signs of similar fusions between biotechnology and
microelectronics.38 This process of convergence is seen as eventually culminating in the
creation of a generalised digital medium within whose networks an enormous range of
transactions and operations--from manufacturing through messaging to medicine--will be
conducted. The information revolution is thus perceived as a technological change that
does not just alter individual products but pervades the fundamental processes of an entire
culture.39
4. The generation of wealth increasingly depends on an `information economy' in
which the exchange and manipulation of symbolic data matches, exceeds or subsumes the
importance of material processing. Since Porat's study of the "information economy" the
idea that information technologies are provoking a qualitative change in the nature of
employment and the sources of wealth has been variously interpreted but widely
accepted.40 The prevailing view now declares that information is a central "economic
resource" of the 21st century.41 Jorge Schement has aptly characterised this creed as
"informational materialism."42 Its main tenets are summarised in the Tofflers' account of the
contemporary "super-symbolic economy"--a "new system of accelerated wealth creation"


41
increasingly dependent on "the exchange of data, information and knowledge," where land,
labour, financing and raw materials become less important than the symbolic knowledge
which can increasingly discover substitutes for them; where technological and
organisational innovation are at a premium; where faster decision-making and better
internal communication are a central commercial objective; where mass production is
replaced with flexible production systems synchronised to detailed customer feedback
about market conditions and preferences; where electronic transfers replace metal or paper
money as the major medium of exchange; where goods and services are modularised and
configured into systems requiring a constant multiplication and revision of standards;
where new abstract and intellectual skills demanding high levels of education and training
become the crucial attributes of the labour force; where computerised monitoring governs
the profitable recycling of wastes; and where global news and data flows are an essential
strategic asset.43 Although other information revolutionaries might dispute the details of this
portrait, it embodies most of the conventional wisdom about the economic importance of
technological knowledge.
5. These techno-economic changes are accompanied by far-reaching and
fundamentally positive social transformations. Here information revolutionaries display
their most enthusiastic optimism. The undesirable features of industrial society--
meaningless work, huge impersonal organisations, rigid routines and hierarchies,
anonymous and alienating urban existences are seen dissolving. In their place, the
information age holds out the hope of diversification, localism, flexibility, creativity, and
equality. Promises include the computer-aided recovery of craft skills and artisanal
traditions; the convenience of universal teleshopping, telebanking, and interactive


42
entertainment; the assistance of expert systems for education, health care, psychotherapy
and home security; the revivification of domestic life in an electronic cottage; the
participatory democracy of electronic town halls; and an historically unprecedented
diffusion every sort of knowledge--'all information in all places at all times.' A brilliant
culture of individual and collective self-actualisation is seen arising from the matrix of the
networks.
This is not to say that information revolutionaries deny potential problems.
Technological unemployment, intrusive surveillance, electronic crime and `future shock'
are all duly acknowledged. But they are represented as problems of adjustment--temporary
setbacks or avoidable hazards on what remains in essence an ascending path. Bell, no
facile utopian, recognises anxieties about technological domination and dehumanisation,
especially in the cultural realm, but nevertheless insists that the tendency of information
systems is toward "the freeing of technology from its `imperative' nature," and the creation
of "alternative modes of achieving individuality and variety within a vastly increased
output of goods."44 Others have been less restrained: Dizard, for example, speaks of the
information society as one where the "the search for a new Eden through the melding of
nature and machine" eventually yields "social salvation through better communication and
information."45
6. The information revolution is planetary in scale. Although early post-
industrialists focused on changes in the developed world, they quickly identified a
tendency toward a unified world economy as one major consequence of enhanced
communication technologies.46 Recognising the disparity between advanced economies and
the Third World, they nevertheless believed in the overall trajectory of `development' by


43
which Western societies pioneered advances that would eventually, given suitable aid,
expert direction and trading connections, be adopted and emulated by other regions. Later
information society theorists followed this logic. Some, strongly influenced by Marshall
McLuhan's notion of an electronic "global village," amplified on this one-world theme in a
very optimistic manner.47 Some have argued that rapid computerisation would enable Third
World countries to leap right from a preindustrial to a post-industrial society--leapfrogging
over the industrial stage. Others suggest that computer and telecommunications would open
up possibilities for decentralised, de-urbanised, village-based industry bringing material
prosperity to the Third World without destroying cultural autonomy and tradition--what
Toffler calls "Gandhi with satellites."48 Even those who don't share these high hopes tend
to see global disparities being rectified by a trickle-down economics in which huge
technologically-generated increases in productivity, although at first concentrated in the
developed world, will eventually be disseminated across the planet.
7. The information revolution marks not only a new phase in human civilisation but
also a new stage in the development of life itself. At the extreme limits of their prediction,
many information revolutionaries see the augmenting powers of intelligent machines
tending logically toward the creation of "synthetic life."49 The steady transfer of human
abilities to machines will, it is argued, lead to the production of technologies whose
capacities exceed those of their creator. Roboticist Hans Moravec typifies this view.
Sooner or later," Moravec asserts, "our machines will become knowledgeable enough to
handle their own maintenance, reproduction and self improvement without help."50 When
this happens, humanity will pass away, "having lost the evolutionary race to a new kind of
competition," superseded by its own "mind children."51 Computers are thus not merely


44
viewed as servants for humankind but also as a potential successor species--the next stage
in evolution.
Tofflerism: Marx Against Marx
As the thesis of post-industrial society transformed into the theory of information
revolution, its anti-Marxism simply remodulated itself. There was perhaps less talk of a
new technocratic class mediating the tensions between capital and labour. But increasingly
the direction of technological development itself was claimed to contradict Marx's
analysis. The computer was discovered as the nemesis of socialism, a machine whose
astounding capacities confounded class struggle.
Again these arguments appeared particularly telling because their proponents often
claimed to be not so much repudiating Marx as simply updating him--following his own
logic through to unanticipated conclusions. Pointing to Marxism's customary emphasis on
the development of the means of production--and interpreting it as referring entirely to
innovations in machinery--information society theorists said, in effect, that if "the handmill
gives you society with the feudal lord; the steam-mill with the industrial capitalist," then
what arrived with the microcomputer was the information society.52 The real `historical
materialists' are those who recognise the arrival of this new order rather than clinging to
outdated notions of capital and class.
No one has pursued this line more energetically than the indefatigable populariser
of information revolution, Alvin Toffler. Toffler is himself a former Marxist convinced by
Stalinism and American affluence that:


45
Marxism was a misleading, obsolete tool for understanding reality in the
high technology world. Using Marxism to diagnose the inner structures of
high technology societies today is like limiting ones self to a magnifying
glass in the age of the electron microscope.53
But although Toffler, and his co-author and wife Heidi, are relentless polemicists against
"antique Marxist ideas, applicable at best to yesterday's industrialism," their own concept
of history owes an obvious debt to Marx.54
The Tofflers' work hinges on a narrative, adapted from Bell's schema of
preindustrial, industrial and post-industrial societies, of civilisation propelled forward by
a series of "waves"--the First agrarian, the Second industrial, the Third, current, wave,
informational.55 Hendrick Hertzberg has recently pointed out an eerie, if superficial
similarity between this and Marx's story of how feudalism (the equivalent of Toffler's
agrarian First wave) gives way to capitalism (the equivalent of the Toffler's Second
Wave), and capitalism, in turn, is replaced by communism (the equivalent of Toffler's
cybernetic Third Wave). As Hertzberg observes,
Each stage, in its time, constitutes a tremendous advance in human progress;
each eventually becomes obsolete (the "contradictions," as the Marxists
say, begin to get out of hand); and the next emerges from the collapsing ruin
of its predecessor.56
Moreover, Hertzberg notes, Toffler even sounds like Marx. The first sentence of his most
recent book, Creating a New Civilisation, reads "A new civilisation is emerging in our
lives, and blind men everywhere are trying to suppress it,"--an obvious plagiarism of the
famous opening of The Communist Manifesto: "A spectre is haunting Europe--the spectre


46
of Communism. All the powers of old Europe have entered into a holy alliance to exorcise
this spectre."57
The crucial difference is, of course, that in Toffler's account the advent of the new
civilisation has nothing to do with class war, and everything to do with computers.
Exploitation of labour, alienation, dehumanising mechanisation, centralisation and
concentration of wealth, immiseration--all are characteristics, not of capitalism per se, but
rather of the fading Second Wave of industrial civilisation--a civilisation to whose
premises Marxism is itself profoundly tied. The advent of the information-driven Third
Wave will overcome such ills. Struggle against capital is irrelevant, because everything
once (and so deceptively) signified by the red flag--the classless society, non-alienated
work, the dissolution of property--will be achieved simply by the operation of the
technology which capital is itself so frenetically developing. "Archaeo-Marxists" who
"nurse dreams of revolution drawn from the yellow pages of yesterday's political tracts"
are left standing as we "speed into a new historical zone."58
The inability of Marxism to respond to the realities of the new era is, the Tofflers
argue, deeply inscribed in its theoretical tenets. Forged in reaction against the Hegelian
idealist philosophy, Marx's materialism is predicated on an opposition between the
physical, sensuous world of objects--the site of production--and the ethereal, abstract
realm of ideas. This binary contrast underpins Marx's notorious `base/superstructure'
metaphor, by which:
 . . . information, art, culture, law, theories and other intangible products of the
mind were merely part of a `superstructure' which hovered, as it were, over the


47
economic base of society. While there was, admittedly, a certain feedback
between the two, it was the base that determined the superstructure, rather than
the reverse.59
Such dualism renders Marxism inherently blind to the productive power of data-exchange,
symbolic manipulation, and the expansion of knowledge--the very activities central to the
modern economy. For Marxists," hardware was always more important than software";
now, however, the computer revolution teaches us that the opposite is true. Today, say the
Tofflers, "it is knowledge that drives the economy, not the economy that drives
knowledge":
Marx, in arguing the primacy of the material base, stood Hegel on his head.
The great irony of history today is that the new system of wealth creation, in
turn, is standing Marx on his.60
In a classic dialectical trope, historical materialism has been dematerialised.
Where the Tofflers find the anachronism of Marxism most obvious is in its concept
of the industrial proletariat as the agent of revolutionary change. It was, they say, not so
much capitalist ownership of the means of production but rather the crude technology of the
"smokestack era" that generated the drudgery against which revolutionary socialism fought.
"Marxism," remark the Tofflers in typical style, "glorified beefy workers straining muscles
in steel mills and factories."61 Now the legions of mass labour are vanishing: the
information economy is eliminating the factory--and with it, Marxism's historical
protagonist.


48
This farewell to the working class--an adieu bidden not only by the Tofflers and
their colleagues but also by many left intellectuals during the 1980s--takes two forms in
information revolution theory. The first, most straightforward, simply argues that
automation will progressively liquidate labour. There will be less and less work--hence
less and less of a `working' class. Early versions of post-industrialism were often linked to
the idea of an emergent `leisure society' in which the most pressing social problem would
be the overcoming of boredom. This vision has never entirely faded from information
society theory. However, an obvious problem diminishes its appeal--namely, that in the
context of a wage economy such a liberation from work manifests as unemployment.
Anxious to refute any idea that they merely aim to replace the tedium of the assembly line
with misery of the welfare queue, information revolutionaries like the Tofflers have in fact
often tended not to focus on the labour saving consequences of automation, and instead
pursue a quite different argument.
In this second version work, instead of being terminated, is transformed. Emphasis
falls not on the quantitative reduction of labour but on its qualitative improvement.
Automation, it is conceded, will eliminate jobs, primarily in manufacturing. But this will
be compensated for by new work, appearing in high technology, information-intensive
industries. However, the new jobs will be different from the ones they replace; they will
be better jobs. Here information society theory elaborates an argument first influentially
stated by the sociologist Robert Blauner during the 1960s in a critique of Marx's theory of
alienation--namely, that advanced technology reverses the inhuman, estranging effects of
industrial machinery on workers62


49
Computers, it is claimed, are fundamentally different from earlier forms of
mechanisation. Transmuting manual drudgery into mental labour, manipulating symbols
rather than objects, informatics not only frees workers from routine drudgery but also
places a new premium on critical and diagnostic capacities, co-operative problem solving
and the reintegration of previously fragmented tasks. These potentials tend to reverse the
Taylorist simplification and fragmentation of work. It either permits, in the weak form of
the argument, or, in its more determinist version, requires dissolution of traditional
hierarchies and command structures, and the introduction of new dimensions of autonomy
and job-satisfaction.
Thus a crucial part of Toffler's description of the Third Wave production depends
on the intellect and skills of the workforce. Industrial workers owned few of the tools of
production; today however "the most powerful wealth-amplifying tools are the symbols
inside workers' heads"63 Workers, therefore, "own a critical, often irreplaceable, share of
the `means of production.'”64The foundation for Marx's theory of class conflict thus drops
away. The consequence of the high-technology, post-Taylorist workplace is the
evaporation not only of the hostility, but even of the distinction, between management and
labour; in its place emerges a shared ethos of participation and professionalism, reinforced
by profit sharing, stock options and workplace quality circles. While there will still be
work, there will be no working `class,' because class as a collective identity based on
adversarial relations of production will have been dissolved.
At some points the Tofflers go even further, and suggests that the Third Wave will
transform not only work, but also property. This is often represented as a necessary
consequence of the economic peculiarities of information intensive goods and services.


50
Because information is not exhausted by use, can be reproduced easily and cheaply, and
often multiplies in value the more widely it is distributed, such goods and services are--
supposedly--immune from ownership or commodification. Since information constitutes the
central resource of the new age these property-transcendent features herald the advent of an
increasingly sharing, co-operative, equalitarian society. According to the Tofflers,
Marxists have an "obsession with ownership" that is anachronistic in an era of "info-
property"--"non-material, non-tangible, and "potentially infinite."65 In the unfolding of this
transformation revolutionary, overthrow of the ruling class is crudely beside the point.
What will occur is rather a gentle auto-dissolution of ownership.
At this point there is an interesting bifurcation in the work of information
revolutionaries. Some theorists, at some moments, look to a future `beyond capitalism.'
This perspective is exemplified by the early work of Toffler, and by the "computopia"
prophecies of Japan's most famous futurist, Masuda. It sees information technology
bringing a gradual, spontaneous and non-antagonistic relaxation of capitalist relations--
with corporate ownership eventually assumed by technologically-participatory workers
and citizens and the abundance of information generated resources dissolving commodity
exchange. What results is nothing less than an electronically-created classless society.
Other information revolutionaries--or sometimes the same theorists at other
moments--look only to a `better capitalism.' This is the view implicit in all the
governmental and corporate descriptions of the information society. It is also the
perspective of Toffler's more recent work, clearly adapted to the free-market climate of the
1980s and 90s. In this perspective, information technologies still produce incredible
economic and societal benefits. But these result mainly from an improved position in an


51
ever more-intensely competitive market society. Electronics yield, not post-capitalism, but
new investment possibilities, more efficient management techniques, better marketing
opportunities--faster, swifter, more efficient commodification.66
Yet despite their apparent divergence, both the `beyond capital' and the `better
capital' versions of the information revolution can be seen pointing in the same direction:
to a future in which the capitalist development of technology leads to social salvation,
whether through the perfection of the market or its transcendence. And in practice,
information revolutionaries straddle both positions without apparent embarrassment.
Masuda, who writes about the dissolution of the commodity form even while serving the
Ministries of the world's most dynamic capitalist power, speaks of his "computopia" not
only as a "classless society" but also as the fulfilment of Adam Smith's vision in The
Wealth of Nations of a "universal opulent society."67 Toffler hopped with ease from talking
about post-capitalism to advising ultra-right wing free marketeer, Newt Gingrich.
Indeed, in many moments of information society theory both visions merge in the
synthesis of a capital without contradictions, conflict or competition. In a typically
nebulous but heartfelt panegyric, William Halal asserts that "the relentless advance of
technology has become the driving force for social change," and celebrates the emergence
of a "hi-tech/hi-touch" business organisation that unites enterprise and democracy. "Rising
like a phoenix from the ashes of a dying epoch" the resulting "New Capitalism" will be so
transformed that "it is really no longer capitalism at all" because "it is governed
democratically to serve a full range of human goals rather than profit alone--yet it is still
free enterprise."68


52
Both the `beyond capitalism' and the `better capitalism' version of the information
revolution see high-technology reshaping society, and both see this as a good thing. Their
shared technological determinism means that the radical possibilities announced by the
visionaries of the `beyond capital' school are conceived of as a direct, linear consequence
of the innovation directed by the pragmatists of the `better capitalism' tendency. For this
reason the positions are complementary rather than antagonistic: the one is the perfect
idealist counterpoint to the utilitarianism of the other. In both cases the prognosis is the
same--more technology. And in both cases, what is decisively off the agenda of the future
is Marx's concept of revolution as class struggle.
The End of History: Déja Vu.
The ultimate vindication of this information-age anti-Marxism was of course the
end of `actually existing socialism.' In the 1970s some post-industrialists had prophesied a
certain convergence of capitalist and socialist systems as each resigned `ideological'
attachment to notions of either the free market or world revolution in favour of a common
resort to technocratic planning. But in the 1980s, the era of the Second Cold War, this
argument gave way to a more aggressive line. Totalitarianism was the inevitable outcome
of Marxism, but computers and telecommunications were "technologies of freedom" with
an intrinsic antipathy to such statism.69 In arguments strongly marked by the influence of
Frederick Hayek, it was widely argued that the creation of a knowledge economy was
inherently related to the play of the open market.70 High technology innovation depended on
levels of enterprise and initiative antithetical to rigid state control. Moreover, application


53
of such innovation would produce a complex and accelerated economy, dependent on data
flows elusive of centralised control. Any regime that attempted to restrict these flows
would inevitably fall victim to the populist technological empowerment brought by the
multiplication of microcomputers, video and fax systems.
It would seem hard to imagine a more convincing vindication of such arguments
than the ignominious disintegration of the Soviet bloc in 1989. As the statues of Lenin
toppled across Europe, Brzezinski, one of the originators of post-industrial theory,
ascribed the Soviet state's degeneration to a failure to grasp the "technetronic revolution"
which made its relative achievements in the field of heavy industrialisation and mass
education obsolete.71 Kenichi Ohmae, theorist of business in a "borderless world,"
enunciated a common verdict when he declared that information "never respected the
Berlin Wall":
. . . in an age of instant information, a wired-for-pictures world . . . any
government that cannot offer Western style choices of material goods,
services and travel will arouse the enmity of its citizens.72
The Tofflers, of course, knew how to truly twist the knife in the wounds of old comrades.
Declaring that "the central failure of the great socialist experiment of the 20th century lay in
its obsolete ideas about knowledge" they observed that;
Marx himself had given the classic definition of a revolutionary moment. It
came, he said, when the `social relations of production' (meaning the nature
of ownership and control) prevent further development of the `means of


54
production' (roughly speaking, the technology). That formula perfectly
described the socialist world crisis. Just as feudal `social relations' once
hindered industrial development, now socialist `social relations' made it all
but impossible for socialist countries to take advantage of the new wealth-
creation system based on computers, communication, and, above all, on
open information.73
The most ambitious statement of such ideas was, however, that of Francis
Fukuyama, a former deputy director in the US State Department and consultant with the
RAND corporation, who in a widely acclaimed article announced "the end of
history."74This, he hastened to point out, did not mean a cessation of empirical events, but
rather that such events could no longer be "understood as a single, coherent evolutionary
process" which would culminate when "mankind had achieved a form of society that
satisfied its deepest and most fundamental longings."75 Beyond such a point no further
progress in the development of underlying principles and institutions could occur, because
"all the really big questions had been settled."76This idea of history had, Fukuyama
observes, been enunciated by Hegel, but "made part of our daily intellectual atmosphere by
Karl Marx," who, he claims, believed that the "end of history" would be marked by the
advent of communism. Now, in the aftermath of the collapse of the USSR, it was clear that,
on the contrary, the "end of history" was achieved by the triumph of capitalist liberal
democracy.
Fukuyama is not a conventional information society theorist. But he shares with
these theorists a teleological faith in technological progress. He finds the "mechanism"
which explains the directionality and coherence of history in the "logic of modern
science."77 This, he claims "would seem to dictate a universal evolution in the direction of


55
capitalism."78 Because the unfolding of applied science makes possible the limitless
accumulation of wealth to satisfy ever-expanding human desires, and also confers
inestimable military advantages, it dictates homogenisation toward the form of society best
able to reap its benefits. This form is capitalist democracy, whose competitive enterprise,
decentralised market decisions and work-ethic favours technological innovation. This
superiority had seemed in doubt when the centrally planned economies of USSR and China
were able to rival the capitalist bloc in industrial production. But the inevitability of
evolution in the direction of "decentralised decision making and markets" became apparent
with the transition to a post-industrial order placing a premium on invention and
information:
One might say in fact that it was in the highly complex and dynamic "post-
industrial" economic world that Marxism-Leninism as an economic system
met its Waterloo.79
With this sorry example of the failure of alternatives, the global adoption of capitalism by
the countries of the developing world--Fukuyama calls it "the victory of the VCR" --is
inevitable.80 Whatever problems the future holds will arise primarily from the boredom
arising from the universal "peace and prosperity" created by the technoscientific
achievement of capitalism.81
This announcement may provoke an uncanny sense of deja vu. For we have come
full circle. The "end of history" Fukuyama presents is a massively enlarged version of the
"end of ideology" thesis, now global in scope and engineered not by industrialism but by


56
post-industrialism. At last, aided by the "mechanism" of information technology, the
spectre of Marxism has finally been laid to rest.
The Road Ahead?
Since 1989 history has, of course, refused to lie down and die. Nothing, however,
has diminished the prevailing conviction that the information revolution represents the
destiny of humankind. In the USA, the embrace of this doctrine by corporations and state
reached a new level of intensity with the Clinton administration's announcement of the so-
called `information superhighway'--a high-bandwidth, omnipurpose, digitalised
telecommunications network interconnecting the nation's computers, phones, and
televisions by fibre optic strands, coaxial cables, satellites and radio waves. In 1994, the
National Information Infrastructure (NII) bill initiated construction of the `highway' as a
governmentally subsidised but privately built, owned and operated network. The
immediate consequence was a frenzy of mergers by telephone, cable and entertainment
corporations positioning themselves to reap profits from video-on demand, telescoping,
telegambling, interactive gaming and on-line advertising.
As many commentators have pointed out, the `highway' image--with its connotations
of linear movement, physical transportation and material solidity--seems hopelessly
inadequate to convey the multi-directional, telecommunicational, virtual interactions of
cyberspace.82 Yet it clearly displays the purposes of the promoters of digital
infrastructures. For the metaphor invokes memories of the post-World War II Golden Age
of capitalism--the period sometimes known as Fordism, in tribute to the central role of the


57
auto-industry as a provider of jobs, production techniques and consumer goods.83 In this
era, road-building was an essential component in the reordering of social life that
integrated assembly-line labour, mass consumption of manufactured goods, suburban
housing and privatised mobility in an industrial regime that sustained three decades of
extraordinary prosperity. The rhetoric of the `highway' serves to summon up remembrances
of this boom period (while, of course, conveniently forgetting about negative effects of
automobile centred growth such as pollution, congestion, alienated labour and community
destruction). By analogy, it defines information technologies--computers and
telecommunications--as the 21st century successors of the 20th century automobiles and
roads, the leading technologies in what is hoped to be a new cycle of capitalist growth.
In this context, the formulas of information society theorists have spouted in an
unquenchable flow from the mouths of governmental and corporate leaders of all
complexions. US Democratic Vice-President Al Gore has made a stock-in-trade of
promising a cornucopia of possibilities for virtual education, democratisation and self-
improvement. In a speech on the "National Information Infrastructure" to the Television
Academy at the University of California in Los Angeles in 1994--a speech stirringly
subtitled "Information Conduits, Providers, Appliances and Consumers"--Gore expanded
on the highway metaphor by noting that if cars had advanced as rapidly as computer chips,
a Rolls Royce would today go a million miles and hour, cost twenty five cents and be one
millimetre in length.84 Such a rate of development,Gore declared, amounted to a "world
revolution." Rhetorically brushing away any hint of conflicting interests from his picture of
the cybernetic future, Gore went on to unblushingly promise business a compliant
regulatory climate, in which the state would facilitate but not encroach on commercial


58
opportunities of cyberspace, and simultaneously to guarantee citizens "open access" to the
networks. Declaring that the economic future of the USA. depended on its ability to grasp
the opportunities of the digital age, he contrasted the "innovation and entrepreneurship" of
capitalism with the dire example of the ex-USSR--"a country that used to put armed guards
in front of copiers"--and declared his hope that "America, born in revolution, can lead the
way in this new, peaceful world revolution" based on digital technology, and exhorted his
audience "not to predict the future but to make firm the arrangements for its arrival."
Gore's technophilia was, however, matched by that of his political rival, Newt
Gingrich, Republican Speaker in the House of Representatives. An aficionado of the works
of the Tofflers--for whose latest book he wrote an introduction--Gingrich synthesised
futurist revolutionary rhetoric with the most reactionary of right wing politics, rhapsodising
freely on the need to wire every child into cyberspace while simultaneously slashing at the
welfare programs. Gingrich's Progress and Freedom Foundation hosts major conferences
on the confluence of capitalism with the information age.85 In 1994 it published a document,
"Cyberspace and the American Dream: A Magna Carta for the Knowledge Age," co-
authored by information age luminaries such as Toffler, George Gilder and Esther Dyson.86
Beginning with a grandiloquent declaration that "The central event of the 20th century is the
overthrow of matter . . . The powers of mind are everywhere ascendant over the brute
force of things," the document is built around a Toffleresque contrast between the Second
`industrial' age and the Third `informational' age, now elaborated with reflections about
cyberspace as a "bioelectronic frontier," a "land of knowledge" whose "exploration can be
civilisation’s truest, highest calling."


59
After ruminating on "the nature of freedom" and "the essence of community" and
rejoicing in the power of cyber-communications to liberate us all from "smokestack barons
and bureaucrats from the past," the "Magna Carta" finally gets down to brass tacks with
some policy recommendations. These are remarkably to the point: strong intellectual
property rights to protect private ownership of information; a `highway' infrastructure to be
owned by an unregulated private monopoly; tax breaks for information-oriented companies;
and the widespread dismantling of federal government regulations.87 These proposals for
the consolidation of information age capitalism are far from airy dreaming; much of the
spirit of the "Magna Carta" proposals moves in the 1996 US Telecommunications Bill, a
legislative testament of faith in the power of deregulated, concentrated capital to manage
the new informational environment.88
The corporate sector itself has been almost as fulsome as its government clients
about the prospects for virtual capitalism. The ruminations of Bill Gates, owner of
Microsoft Corporation and cyberspace's premier captain of industry, can be taken as
exemplary. In his biography The Road Ahead--a title that carefully echoes the rhetoric of
the information highway--Gates looks forward to what he calls "Friction Free Capitalism."
In this scenario, omnipresent digital technologies become the basis for the perfection of the
market. Gates, who has the frankness to acknowledge that the driving force behind the
information highway is "the race for the gold," nonetheless introduces a utopianism of his
own when he suggests that the movement of business into cyberspace will produce Adam
Smith's dream of a world of "perfect knowledge" or "perfect information," a prerequisite
for "perfect competition." Ignoring the ironies that such words invite in the mouth of the
information age's most aggressive monopolist, Gates promises us "a new world of low-


60
friction, low-overhead capitalism, in which market information will be plentiful and
transaction costs low. It will be a shopper's heaven."89 Freed by technology from its
rigidities and imperfections, the market passes into a veritable paradise of exchange, in
which the global digital grids and lattices connect the whole planet in the limitless
transaction of prosperity and freedom.
However, even in such utopian pictures a few shadows sometimes appear. In the
context of a unified capitalist world economy, discussion of the information revolution is
now inseparable from that of `globalisation.'90 A harder, more anxious note replaces
rhapsodies about the “global village”. For it is now the pressure of a communicationally
integrated and increasingly competitive world market which enforces adaptation to the
information age. Techno-idealism falls to computer-age realpolitik. Rhetoric urging the
rapid adoption of new technologies now relies not only on the utopian promises of such
technologies, but, even more, on the costs--in terms of lost jobs and declining living
standards- of refusing them. However, if this introduces a newly anxious note to the
approach of the information revolution, it in no way diminishes its inexorability. While in
an era of mounting technological unemployment and global corporate mobility there may be
some qualms about the universal benevolence of the information age, there is even less
doubt about its necessity.
The world-wide collapse of socialist regimes, or their clear subordination to
market discipline, has meant that anti-Marxist diatribes now seem beyond the point for
contemporary high-tech futurists, such as George Gilder, Nicholas Negroponte, Michael
Rothschild or Kevin Kelly and the editors of Wired magazine. Rather, they focus on the
necessary identification of technological progress and the market economy. Many


61
commentaries endorse the views put frankly by Rothschild, whose recent "bionomic"
analysis of an "economy derived from technical information" asserts that "capitalism is
simply the way technology evolves" and is the "inevitable, natural state of human affairs"--
a phenomenon which it is a "waste of time and mental energy" to oppose, because "Like it
or not, the sun rises in the east."91
Yet despite the loss of any easily-identifiable ideological opponent, information
capital's revolutionary intellectuals retain a messianic sense of mission. Some recent
predictions by the roboticist, Moravec remind us of the scope of their ambitions.
Envisaging the emergence within the foreseeable future of highly advanced artificial
intelligences, he asks us further to imagine that "most of the human universe has been
converted to a computer network--a cyberspace--where such programs live, side by side,
with downloaded human minds and accompanying simulated human minds."92 Moravec
then outlines the political economy of this world. The cyberspatial entities will all make
their living "in something of a free market way," trading the products of their labour for the
essentials of life in the networks--memory space and computing time. Some will convert
undeveloped parts of the universe into cyberspace or improve the performance of existing
patches, thus creating new wealth. Others will act as banks, storing and redistributing
resources, buying and selling computing space, time and information:
Some entities in the cyberspace will fail to produce enough value to
support their requirements for existence--these eventually shrink and
disappear, or merge with other ventures. Others will succeed and grow.93


62
Moravec says that the closest present day parallel to the existence of these virtual creatures
would be "the growth, evolution, fragmentation, and consolidation of corporations, whose
options are shaped primarily by their economic performance.94 Noting that "a human would
likely fare poorly " in such a cyberspatial market, he looks, without regret, to the necessary
conclusion--our species merger with or supersession by these corporatised synthetic
entities.95 Reading such apocalyptic visions, one cannot but hear the echoes of some lines
of Marx's of which McKenzie Wark has recently reminded us in his brilliant discussion of
computerised stock markets--lines in which the young Marx speaks of the ultimate
destination of capital: "finally--and this goes for the capitalists too--an inhuman power
rules over everything."96
Appropriations and Exorcisms
The doctrine of the information revolution, as it has unfolded over the last half
century, has proven to be much more than just futurist speculation or even sociological
description. Rather, it has become an indispensable ingredient in a massive reorganisation
of advanced capitalist societies, centred on the introduction of new technologies.
Formulated and promoted within the think-tanks, policy institutes, laboratories, government
offices and consultancy circuits of the most powerful and prosperous centres of the
capitalist world economy, the theory of an inevitable information revolution provides the
rationale for this restructuring, legitimisation for social dislocation, and exhortation toward
a radiant future.


63
In its development, this idea has been propelled forward by competition with
another revolutionary theory that aimed to become a "material force": Marxism. This was
the foe that was meant to have been defeated by the "end of ideology" in the affluence of
post-war industrial societies. It was in response to an unforeseen crisis of these societies,
a crisis of international and domestic insurgencies permeated by the spirit of supposedly
dead and buried Marxism, that Bell and his colleagues produced the concept of post-
industrialism. Their annunciation of a new age was not merely a prediction, but a project,
an effort both of prophecy and partisanship aimed at setting in motion the social and
technological measures necessary to restore the stability of an order threatened by what
they saw as chaotic and subversive forces. This is the idea, which has subsequently
flowered into theories of the information revolution and virtual capitalism.
The relation of these theories to Marxism is, however, not just one of antagonism,
but of appropriation. Produced by intellectuals who were often familiar with or had
actually espoused Marxist ideas, the concept of the information society derives much of its
analytic force and imaginative power from a rewriting of Marxism that retains the notion of
historical progress towards a classless society, but reinscribes technological advance
rather than class conflict as the driving force in this transformation. It thus annexes the idea
of `revolution.' The collapse of actually existing socialism in popular uprisings intimately
linked to the capacities of new media to carry messages across the walls and curtains
behind which Marxian regimes had sheltered from the world market is, in the eyes of
information revolutionaries, the vindication of this project. It marks the final,
technologically-aided exorcism of the ghost of Marx. In what follows, however, I will


64
argue that this exorcism has failed. But first we must see what other Marxists have made of
`the information revolution.'

maverick Trotskyite, James Burnham in The Managerial Revolution. (Bloomington: Indiana

establishing bureaucrats and administrators as the dominant class in capitalist and socialist
countries alike was in turn inspired by Trotsky's critique of the "bureaucratic degeneration"
of the USSR.

30 It is symptomatic of this new tone that when Bell recast his earlier arguments in terms of
the information society theory he retained three of his original five descriptors of
postindustrialism, but dropped two--those dealing with the the professional and technical
class and the future orientation which he had previously related to the enlarged scope of
governmental planning and public policy. He does not explain this change. It can be
speculated that it reflects not only the heightened prominence automated information
systems had gained since the early 1970s, but also a rightward political shift, creating a
'free-enterprise' climate hostile to planning and bureaucracy in which computerisation was
frequently hailed as means of eliminating professional and technical jobs--technology
turned against technocracy.

40 In his post-industrial thesis Bell drew on the economic model of the "march through the
sectors" developed by Colin Clark in The Conditions of Economic Progress (London:


70
                                                                                                                                                
Macmillan, 1940). Dividing the economy into three sectors--primary (agricultural),
secondary (manufacturing), and tertiary (services)--Clark had posited a historical process
in which, as productivity rose successively in each sector, the bulk of the labour force
migrated to the next. Postindustrial society, Bell claimed, marked the point where the
majority of the labour force moved into the service sector--a proposition whose
definitional clarity and historical accuracy has since been the subject of hot debate.
Subsequently, some information society theorists have built on this contested foundation to
posit a distinct, delimited 'quaternary' information sector constituted by high-technology
industry and succeeding agriculture, manufacture and services at the leading edge of
economic growth. However, such models have been strongly criticised for obscuring the
actual interconnection and overlap of allegedly discrete sectors. And in fact what studies
such as Porat's show is the ubiquity of symbol-manipulating tasks across a wide range of
occupations. Many theorists have therefore abandoned the notion of a distinct information
"sector," and now favour an analysis which stresses the increased importance of
informational activity as a component within all aspects of the economy. Information
processing is seen not so much as a successor to manufacturing, services, or agriculture,
but rather as a "superordinate" function whose productivity-improving powers span each of
these areas.

66 For a sophisticated version of this position, one can do no better than the account of the
"control revolution" offered by James Beniger, a former official with the US Food and
Drug Administration. Beniger argues that information technologies represent the
consummation of a century long quest by capitalism to develop instruments of
"technobureaucratic control" adequate to overcome the repeated crises in production,
consumption and distribution of goods encountered during industrialisation. As the
culmination of this "control revolution", microelectronic methods of automation, co-
ordination, inventory, and advertisement are revolutionary in a double sense. On the one
hand, they mark a dramatic advance in human progress, offering means to overcome
protracted tumults and disorder of industrialism. But they are also revolutionary in a
"cyclical," "astronomical," sense, implying the "restoration of levels of economic and
political control" exercised in pre-industrial era. The information revolution is thus both a
progressive and a conservative revolution. Like so many information revolutionaries,
Beniger tips his cap to Marx, citing the famous aphorism about the way "men make their
own history, but not under circumstances of their own choosing," and observing that
because these circumstances have shifted "from land and capital to information" social
theory inherited from the nineteenth century is now challenged "much as the Industrial

Revolution challenged Marx . . . to reconsider preindustrial theories." But the end to which
Beniger's reconsideration of social theory looks is in fact precisely antithetic to Marx's.
For what it envisages is a market society in which the development of cybernetic
programming and and feedback techniques--including, Beniger believes, the eventual
creation of synthetic life forms--enables the removal of all blockages and interruptions
from the circuits of the commodity. The result is a seamlessly integrated totality, a perfect
structural-functionalist harmony in which every moment of social activity is organically
connected with and responsive to the other in fulfilment of the needs of the capitalist
whole.
