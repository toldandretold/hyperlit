Chapter 5
Circuits
The Circuit of Capital
The previous chapter traced the history that led class war onto the terrain of the
information revolution. This one makes a map of the contemporary battleground. To do so,
it uses one of one of Marx's central concepts, that of the circuit of capital.1 Put simply, this
shows how capital depends for its operations not just on exploitation in the immediate
workplace, but on the continuous integration of a whole series of social sites and
activities--sites and activities which, however, may also become scenes of subversion and
insurgency. Today, this circuit of accumulation and resistance passes through robotised
factories, interactive media, virtual classrooms, biotechnological laboratories, in vitro
fertilisation clinics, hazardous waste sites and out into the global networks of cyberspace.
Marx's original account describes only two moments in the circuit of capital. In
production, labour power and means of production (machinery and raw materials) are
combined to create commodities. In circulation, commodities are bought and sold; capital
must both sell the goods it has produced, realising the surplus value extracted in
production, and purchase the labour power and means of production necessary to restart
the process over again.
Since Marx proposed this model, however, capital has prodigiously expanded the
scope of its social organisation. This expansion, and the resistances it has provoked, has
made visible aspects of its circuit that he largely overlooked, but which are identified in
the autonomist analysis of the social factory.2 In the 1970s Mariarosa Dalla Costa and
Selma James made a crucial revision when they insisted that a vital moment in capital's


199
circuit was the reproduction of labour power---that is, the activities in which workers are
prepared and repaired for work.3 These are processes conducted not in the factory, but in
the community at large, in schools, hospitals, and, above all, in households, where they
have traditionally been the task of unwaged female labour.
More recently, another round of struggles has called attention to further aspects of
capital's circuits, previously largely overlooked by Marxists--the reproduction of nature.
Capital must not only constantly find the labour power to throw into production, but also
the raw materials this labour power converts into commodities. As mounting ecological
catastrophe catalyzes intensifying protests by green movements and aboriginal peoples, it
has become apparent that faith in the limitlessness of such resources is profoundly
mistaken. Whether raw materials are in fact available for accumulation depends on the
extent of capital's territorial and technological reach, on the degree to which ecosystems
have been depleted and defiled, and on the level of resistance this devastation arouses. The
reproduction (or non-reproduction) of nature increasingly becomes a problem for capital
and a terrain of conflict for those who oppose it.4
Taking account of the insights won not just by workers' struggles but also by
feminist and environmental movements this chapter posits a modified version of Marx’s
circuit of capital, constituted by four moments--production, the reproduction of labour
power (which is in turn examined under three sub-headings dealing with welfare,
schooling and medical services respectively), the reproduction of nature and, finally,
circulation. At each point we will see how capital uses high-technologies to enforce
command, by imposing increased levels of workplace exploitation, expanding its
subsumption of various social domains, deepening its penetration of the environment,


200
intensifying market relations, and establishing an overarching, panoptic system of
measurement, surveillance and control through digital networks.
However--and this is crucial--the cartography of capital’s circuit maps not just its
strengths but also its weaknesses. In plotting the nodes and links necessary to capital's
flow, it also charts the points where those continuities can be ruptured. At every moment
we will see how people oppose capital's technological discipline by refusal or
reappropriation; how these struggles multiply throughout capital's orbit; how conflicts at
one point precipitate crises in another; and how activists are using the very machines with
which capital integrates its operations to connect their diverse rebellions. In particular, I
argue that the development of new means of communication vital for the smooth flow of
capital’s circuit--fax, video, cable television, new broadcast technologies and especially
computer networks--also create the opportunity for otherwise isolated and dispersed points
of insurgency to connect and combine with one another. The circuit of high technology
capital thus also provides the pathways for the circulation of struggles. I draw examples
primarily from a North American context, perhaps one of the most inauspicious of current
contexts for class struggle and, consequently, an acid test for the contention that such
conflict has not vanished from the horizons of the information era.
Production: Automatic Systems
Let us start (though not stay) at the traditional heart of Marxist theory, the immediate
point of production, the site of work. Here, the information revolution has meant, first and
foremost, a leap towards a new, digitised level of automation--an extraordinary


201
intensification of capitals' perennial drive to eliminate its dependence on labour by
transferring workers' knowledge into machines. Over the last twenty five years
management has invested massively in computerised production technologies--
numerically-controlled machine tools, robots, automatic delivery devices, and just-in time
inventory systems.
These cybernetic devices first appeared in the workplace shortly after the end of
the Second World War, primarily in manufacturing and petro-chemical industries.5 At first,
their components were introduced in a piecemeal fashion, and only gradually connected in
increasingly self-regulating complexes. This process was, however, accelerated by the
industrial revolts of the 1960s and 1970s. Advanced versions of the new systems, aimed at
a maximum reduction of the workforce and seamless, centralised control from
managerially-controlled command centers were brought into the car factories, chemical
plants, and steel mills where mass worker militancy had been strongest. Even where these
experimental systems were so expensive as to be, in strictly economic terms, inefficient,
their labour-eliminating capacity was frequently critical in crushing the most advanced
elements of working class organisation.6 Today, however, such systems are being
experimented with throughout all sectors of work, from nursing to pizza-making to
lighthouse-keeping; while the fully implemented versions are still futuristic islands in a sea
of more traditional work methods, their discrete elements are widely disseminated, and the
tendency toward integration evident.
The labour-reducing capacities of these `new production systems,’ in their
advanced forms, are truly remarkable. The most sophisticated Japanese automated
factories claim to have nearly halved their workforce, while simultaneously tripling


202
production: in California, a plant capable of manufacturing a billion dollars worth of
computers a year requires only five manual-assembly workers and fewer than one-hundred
other workers, mostly engineers.7 Although such levels of automation are only the latest
step in capital’s long-protracted substitution of technology for people, it nonetheless seems
that computerisation does mark a watershed in the relation between worker and machine--a
quantum leap in the predominance of fixed over variable capital, dead labour over living.
Indeed, with the advent of new production systems we surely reach that horizon long-ago
foreseen by Marx where capital attains its "full development" with the creation of,
. . . an automatic system of machinery . . . a moving power that moves itself
. . . consisting of numerous mechanical and intellectual organs, so that the
workers themselves are cast merely as its conscious linkages.8
When he wrote these lines Marx undoubtedly had in mind the smoky clangor of a nineteenth
century industrial site. Yet they apply with redoubled accuracy to the sterile, silent
informational systems with which twenty-first century capital is now attempting to solve its
long-standing `labour problem.’
In North America, this solution for many years seemed to be succeeding remarkably
well. Throughout the 1980s, capital’s massive investments in advanced technology played
a vital role in crushing strikes. From airports, where the availability of new levels of
automation was a critical to the success of the Reagan administration in firing air-traffic
controllers, to the meatpacking industry, where extensive technological restructuring


203
reached a climax with the defeat of the two-year long strike at Hormel, new production
systems repeatedly helped capital prevail in workplace conflict.9 In other sectors, such as
the auto industry, fear of losing jobs to new technology quelled militancy and contributed to
a climate of demoralisation and defeat in which once-defiant industrial unions acquiesced
to concession bargaining and co-operation with management. Capital’s technological
superiority appeared to be absolute.
Yet although robotised systems have significantly depleted the ranks of the
industrial working class, it is clearly false to suggest that cybernetic systems entirely
eliminate capital’s need for labour. Despite the dreams of wide-eyed digital futurists, the
total liquidation of human intelligence from the production process has proven a singularly
intractable project. In many manufacturing sectors computerised automation has made
production dramatically `leaner.’ Yet the full `lights out’ scenario--in which the final
worker replaced by a robot exits the building and turns out the lights, leaving behind a
smoothly running automated darkness--remains an unattained goal. And even in the rare
plants which approach such scenarios, the operations of such so-called` workerless
factories’ in fact rest on a surrounding infrastructure of activities--from maintenance to
marketing--still dependent on myriad human agents.
Indeed, if one examines the last quarter century of high-technology innovation, a
paradox appears. While in the factory wage-labour has been relatively reduced, in the
larger social arena it has, if anything, expanded. Ever-wider areas of human activity--from
education to meal-making--being more widely and intensively subsumed within the
capitalist organisation of work. This is what is usually described as the rise of the `service
sector.’ As we saw in Chapter 2, this phenomenon has long been central to the analysis of


204
information society theorists like Daniel Bell and Alvin Toffler. In their hands, however,
the process has been so mythologised--as a sublimation of sweaty blue-collared
proletarians into suave white-collared professionals--to amount to a near-total
mystification the actual recomposition of the post-industrial workforce. 10
 For a more penetrating analysis, it is useful to look back for a moment to Marx. In
the Grundrisse, while emphasising capital’s relentless drive to replace humans with
machines--a trajectory that is of course central to his whole vision of crisis and revolution-
-Marx nonetheless does not speak of the total elimination of labour by automation. Rather,
he refers to its transformation into the “conscious linkage” within a technological system.
“Direct production”—the `hands-on’ transformation of raw materials into finished
products--would be increasingly automated. Living labour would be not so much "included
within the production process" but relate to it "more as watchman and regulator"--a
description which neatly covers the sort of invigilating and trouble-shooting functions for
which human beings are still found indispensable, even in the most sophisticated of new
production systems.11 Moreover, Marx implies, there would remains a field of activities
indirectly necessary for production, in which human involvement would remain--or indeed
become increasingly-- crucial. This indirect labour would entail two main types of
activity: on the one hand “scientific labour” and on the other “social combination.”12
Later, in Chapters 8 and 9, I will discuss the problems that Marx saw these
developments creating for capital. But at the moment I simply want only to suggest that in
these cryptic phrases, “scientific labour” and “social combination,” he offers some
orientation towards analyzing the notoriously amorphous service sector. Applying his lens,
we can discern within the category two distinct groups, both of whom are now being


205
systematically assimilated into the capitalist organisation of work. On the one hand, there
is “scientific labour”--the scientists, programmers, engineers and designers celebrated in
information society theorists portrayals of the `knowledge workers’ of the future. But on the
other, there are the multifarious workers concerned with the tasks of “social combination,”
involved in facilitating and sustaining the matrix of everyday human intercourse and
interaction within which even the most automated production remains obdurately
embedded. These tasks of  “social combination” comprise some relatively well paid,
creative and prestigious jobs, especially in the media and communications sectors. But they
also include the legions of retail clerks, cleaners, janitors, security guards, and fast-food
servers who, in fact, make up the bulk of employment in the information economy.13
Numerically much more significant than the “scientific labour” they support, but enjoying
only a fraction of the rewards, these latter workers constitute the new high-technology
proletariat.
Relative to the old industrial working class, concentrated in its factory bastions,
these new forms of “social” and “scientific” labour-power might appear unlikely
contenders in class struggle. They are disorganised, insofar as they come into being outside
the orbit of the traditional workers’ movement, towards whose symbols and institutions
they are often indifferent or hostile. They are dispersed, across an enormous variety of
spatially separated and qualitatively diverse sites. And they are divided, in a multitude of
ways, but particularly by the lines separating the relatively privileged cadres of “scientific
labour” from the super-exploited “social” labour that sustains it--a division frequently
reinforced by ethnicity and gender. Nevertheless, the presence of these post-industrial
labouring subjects, even in the midst of a world of artificial intelligences and information


206
highways, constitutes an ominous spot on management’s’ dream of an immaculate techno-
system freed from the insubordinate possibilities of human presence.
Indeed, in the last few years there have been signs that the post-industrialists’
requiem mass for class struggle was premature. Since the early 1990s a series of strikes
and organising drives in both the US and Canada have seemed to signal an unexpected
revival of labour militancy. In 1996, the number of hours lost to strike action in the US,
after dropping precipitously for decades, began to rise again, although only very slightly.14
More significant than such quantitative measure, however, were certain qualitative aspects
of the new insurgencies. For they were no longer predominantly "mass worker" actions,
situated in the classic industrial centres of working class power, but frequently arose
outside the factory, in the diffuse, social labour of the service sector. The continuing
militancy of many traditional industrial communities--one thinks of the three-way strike by
rubber, sugar and vehicle-manufacturing workers in Illinois `class war-zone’-- cautions
against any quick farewell to traditional terrains of class war. 15 But the wave of labour
restiveness also passes through new territories. Often it involves workers at the bottom of
the hierarchy of labour power, whose networks of support are founded as much in gender
and ethnicity as in the traditions of the labour movement. While established trades unions
may provide the organisational form, and sometimes real support and leadership, for these
insurgencies, such rebellions constantly bubbled up at a local level below and sometimes
in opposition to the upper levels of union bureaucracies, challenging established structures
and strategies, and reshaping them from below. 16
For an example, one need look no farther than Silicon Valley, historic centre of the
US computer industry.17 The most well known aspect of the Valley’s labour-history is the


207
emergence of the new strata of highly skilled technical workers--engineers, software
designers and programmers--central to the making of digital technology. Mostly male,
mostly white, very highly educated (the Valley has largest concentration of Ph.D.'s and
engineers in the world) these are the quintessential `knowledge workers’ needed by an
industry whose profit depends on a constant stream of innovation. Highly-paid, frenetically
creative, technologically compulsive, often enjoying substantial entrepreneurial
opportunities, this elite workforce has been the subject of innumerable adulatory media
reports, making their exploits an important part of the information revolution’s romantic
mythology.
 There is, however, another, far less glamorous, face to work in Silicon Valley--
that of the janitors, landscapers, cafeteria staff, and microchip assemblers who provide the
indispensable support for this technological creativity. Drawn largely from often immigrant
or ethnic minority communities, these workers--many of them women--are employed at low
or minimum pay, outside union organisation, without health insurance, maternity benefits or
recourse against sexual harassment. The Valley’s prestigious high-tech companies, such as
Apple, Intel, Hewlitt Packard, Oracle and IBM, could not function without this labour
force. But the major corporations try to distance themselves from unsightly super-
exploitation by a system of contracting-out that allows disavowal of responsibility for
working conditions and wages. The workplace segregation between the high-end
knowledge workers and low-end service labour is reinforced by residential patterns that
divide the Valley into ethnically sorted zones. Although Silicon Valley is situated in the
most prosperous county in the US, aggregate wealth on closer examination decomposes


208
into a scene of postindustrial segmentation where "the First World meets the Third in a
weird melange of high technology and misery."18
For many years, the dispersed nature of the Silicon Valley service workforce, its
high turnover, and divided ethnic composition, led the US labour movement to deem it
unorganisable. In the early 1990s, however, following a wave of worker complaints,
Justice for Janitors, an organisation of Services Employees International Union, began a
series of campaigns fighting for union recognition, pay raises, and settlement of sexual
harassment grievances.19 These campaigns used a wide variety of tactics--strikes, picket
lines, demonstrations, advertisements, leafleting campaigns, hunger strikes---which,
although all part of the historic repertoire of the American labour movement, were
conducted with an energy and determination that contrasted sharply with the submissive
defeatism prevailing in many major trades unions.
Moreover, in some respects the Justice for Janitors campaigns went beyond
familiar models of shopfloor activism. They made connections between workplace
conditions and issues of race and gender discrimination, and forged alliances with feminist
and ethnic community organisations. Because Silicon Valley workers are often directly or
indirectly exposed to the highly toxic chemicals used in microchip manufacture, they were
also on occasion able to link labour struggles with those of environmental and housing
activists challenging the computer industry’s poisoning of the local environment through
ground, air and water pollution. 20
 
The scope of the Justice for Janitors campaign took employers aback. The turning
point in the mobilising drive at Apple, for example, came when workers threatened to take
their campaign into the classrooms of California schools and universities--a major market


209
for Macintosh computers. The result was small but significant victories at a number of
high-tech companies--union certifications, pay raises, settlements of harassment cases.
Labour councils in Silicon Valley are now speaking in terms of more extensive campaigns
that will address not only the terrible conditions of `service’ workers, but also some of the
grievances of the `scientific’ workforce, such as maniacal schedules and lack of job
security. These new campaigns will, one organiser says, involve “everybody from janitors
to technical writers to software gypsies and testers to quality assurance engineers”:
The janitors were just the first among the contingent workforce . . .When we
talk about doing windows in this valley, we're not just talking about the
janitors who clean them, but the software engineers who write them.21
The revolt in Silicon Valley--Mecca of an industry whose products are specifically
intended to free capital from dependence on troublesome humanity--presents an extreme
irony. But it is by no means exceptional. During the 1990s, North America’s restructured,
post-Fordist, informational capitalism has been riddled with unanticipated conflicts. The
battle in the computer industry has spread to other areas in the US, and now involves
organisations such as the Southwest Network for Environmental Economic Justice, a
coalition of over fifty grassroots organisations from Texas, Oklahoma, New Mexico,
Colorado, Arizona, Nevada and California fighting toxic pollution and poor working
conditions.22 In Los Angeles, the same communities that rose up in the 1992 riots generated
a surge of labour militancy sweeping the hotels, fast foods, restaurants and dry-walling
sectors.23 In Las Vegas janitors and cleaners took on the giant high-technology gambling


210
and entertainment complexes of MGM.24 Along the US/Mexico line, women workers fought
a mobile garment industry that migrated sweatshop operations across borders.25 Delivery
workers of a partially-reformed Teamsters’ union won a historic victory against United
Parcels, at the heart of the increasingly important high-tech communication/transportation
industry. In Canada, protests against labor legislation and austerity programs from the
Ontario provincial government produced an unprecedented series of rolling one-day
general strikes in urban centres, while Quebec unions opened a major drive to organise the
youth labour in the McDonald’s fast-food chain. Elsewhere, the decade saw major
workplace battles waged by airline attendants from Alaska to Miami; newspaper workers
in San Francisco and Detroit; teaching assistants at Yale and other universities, and nurses
and education workers resisting public spending cutbacks from New York to Vancouver.26
These movements are, in terms of the types of workers involved, extraordinarily
diverse--so much so that they at first seem to defy generalisation. But this diversity is, in
itself, an important defining feature. For these are the revolts of a collective labouring
subject which is no longer an homogenous and concentrated industrial proletariat, but
rather heterogeneous and connective, performing the innumerable social activities
necessary to maintain the flow of production within capital’s increasingly complex and
extended techno-systems. And this new positioning of labour gives new organisational
form to its uprisings. Situated as the interstitial “conscious linkages” within capital’s
automated and elaborated chains of production, rebellious workers have been compelled to
increasingly seek “conscious linkages” with one another. Recognising the extreme
vulnerability of isolated fights, the new labour movements are frequently to be found
expanding the scope of struggle beyond the immediate site of conflict, following the


211
increasingly comprehensive and social scope of capital’s own circuits. This tendency takes
a variety of forms: increased efforts to organise sectorially, rather than in single plants;
cross-sectorial connections, such as linkages between striking workers in the
telecommunications and garment industries, or the mutual support between airline
attendants, construction workers and bus drivers; and increased resort to consumer
boycotts and `corporate campaigns' hitting at every aspect of an employer's investments.27
Even more importantly, workers' organisations have entered into experimental
coalitions with other social movements also in collision with corporate order, such as
welfare, anti-poverty, students, consumer and environmental groups. The result has been
new oppositional combinations. Thus, striking telephone workers join seniors, minorities
and consumer groups to beat back rate hike, or unionising drives in the ghettos of the fast
food and clothing industries intertwine with campaigns against racism and the persecution
of immigrants.28 Such alliances are fraught with difficulties, and can easily disintegrate. But
they expand the boundaries of official `labour' politics, so that the agency of
countermobilisation against capital begins to become, not so much the trades union, defined
as a purely workplace organisation, but rather the "labour/community alliance," with a
broader, social sphere of demands and interests.29
Discussing these developments, Kim Moody (who is connected to the Detroit
journal Labor Notes, an important node in the US circuits of labour dissidence) suggests
that the North American labour movement in the this century has gone through three phases
of organisation--from “craft” unions, to “industrial” unions, to an emergent “social
movement unionism.”30 For Moody, “social movement unionism, ” the vital current of
today’s struggles, is an activism whose scope expands beyond the factory gate into a wider


212
arena, overflowing the limits of strictly workplace struggle to include demands for broad
social and economic change and alliance with other movements. It is a form of struggle in
which “unions provide much of the economic leverage and organisational resources, while
social-movement organisations . . . provide greater numbers and a connection to the less
well organised or positioned sections of the working class.”31
This revival of worker militancy in North America coincides with similar, but
stronger, tendencies in Europe during the 1990s--the French general strikes of 1995-1996,
the Italian` Coba’ movement and wave of labour unrest in Britain and Germany.32 As we
have seen, Negri and other autonomist Marxists, writing predominantly in this European
context, have also theorised three cycles of class struggle and recomposition; from the
“professional” worker of the late 19th century, to the “mass “ worker of capital’s Fordist
era, to the emergent “socialised” worker of the current, post-Fordist, informational period.
What Negri and Moody are both suggesting, in different idioms and from different
national settings, is that capital’s high-technology decimation of the industrial working
class does not amount to the end of class struggle. The new production systems have
partially chased waged-labour out of the factory. In doing so, however, capital has diffused
its organisation of labour-power through society at large. These conditions of dispersal
initially appear as the depletion and fragmentation of traditional class solidarities. But they
can be reconstituted as conditions of new scope and interconnection. Contrary to
postindustrial fantasy, workplace conflicts are not dissolved in the new digital
environment; but they are decentred and recomposed with other arenas of activism.
However, to understand this dynamic more deeply, we must go beyond the workplace and
into the proliferating confrontations between popular movements and the capitalist state.


213
Reproduction of Labour Power I: The Panoptic State
If labour-power is to be available for exploitation it must constantly be reproduced.
That is to say, people must be socialised, schooled, trained, prepared and held in readiness
for work, in the quantities and qualities required by capital. Marx noted that "the
maintenance and reproduction of the working class remains a necessary condition for the
reproduction of capital,” but, reflecting both the laissez-faire political economy of his era
and the blindspots of his gender, omitted this process from his detailed analysis of capital's
circuits, declaring that "the capitalist may safely leave this to the worker's drives for self-
preservation and propagation." 33 Over the course of the twentieth century, however, other
Marxists, and particularly those within the autonomist tradition, have pointed out that in the
course of its development capital has increasingly been unwilling, and unable, to take this
reproductive activity for granted. To ensure the proper supply and disciplining of the minds
and bodies required for work, it has been compelled to systematically extend its control
over society as a whole--a control mediated through the Leviathan-like structures of the
state.34
 
Thus the first half of the twentieth century saw all advanced capitalist societies, to
varying degrees, respond to the threat of militant working class movements with a shift
from the "Rights State"--where the activity of government was restricted to securing the
conditions for the free-market--to the "Planner State"--in which the state managed the
reproduction of labour power through a vast array of schools, hospitals, welfare offices,
and other institutions. Although this transition was set in motion to ward off revolutionary
dangers, it also laid the basis for a new stage in capitalist growth. For the schools, health


214
care systems and various forms of social payments of the Planner State cultivated the
increasingly healthy, educated and peaceful forms of` `human capital' necessary for
intensive technoscientific development of the Fordist era. The advent of what is generally
known as the welfare state represented an ingenious social compromise crafted by
reformist business interests, social-democratic politicians and trades-union leaders, which
constituted both a real victory for workers--in terms of a general betterment of living
conditions--and a careful containment of that victory within the overall parameters of
continuing capitalist accumulation.
In the 1960s and 70s, however, this uneasy settlement began to disintegrate.
Movements of workers, the unemployed, welfare recipients, students and minority groups
began to make demands on the vast system of social administration that transgressed the
limits set by capitalist logic. They demanded, and sometimes won, increases in social
expenditures going beyond those compatible with business’s strictly rationed plans for
improving its workforce. In certain cases, such movements were also able to gain a degree
of local control over the administration of social programs so they were, in effect, running
the state apparatus from below.35 These encroachments were intolerable for North
American and European capital, whose rate of profit was already being squeezed by
shopfloor militancy and international competition. Its response--part of the larger
neoliberal restructuring offensive--was to repudiate the post-war social contract and
dismantle the Planner State, destroying what it could no longer control.
The new regime of governance, whose full appearance is usually identified with the
electoral victories of Reagan and Thatcher, has a double face. On the one hand,
privatisation, deregulation and cutbacks systematically subvert the welfare state, slashing


215
the social wage, weeding out enclaves of popular control, and attacking any of labour’s
protections from the disciplinary force of the market. The costs of reproducing labour
power are increasingly devolved back onto individuals and households. This shift becomes
ever more important to capital as corporate downsising and automation ejects more and
more workers from production, thereby swelling the ranks of the unemployed and
impoverished, increasing welfare roles and diminishing tax revenues. On the other, those
aspects of the state necessary to the protection of accumulation--such as the security
apparatus or subsidisation of high technology investment--are strengthened. There thus
appears the paradoxical neoliberal combination of what Andrew Gamble terms "the free
market and the strong state."36 In what autonomists term the “Crisis State,” the
governmental apparatus is dissolved in so far as it serves popular purposes, but maintained
or enlarged as the coercive and administrative arm of capital.
Computers, telecommunications and biotechnologies are embedded at the very core
of the Crisis State, as both means and end. Social programs are cut to free revenues for
assistance to corporations make huge investments in high technology, public channeled to
private purposes either directly through subsidisation or indirectly through tax breaks. High
technology is, in turn, used to effect cuts to welfare programs that start to be administered
through increasingly precise and omnipresent digitised systems. The delivery of social
services is increasingly automated--for example, by computerising the making of welfare
or unemployment insurance claims. This process not only cuts staff costs, but also reduces
payments by imposing daunting electronic hurdles which have to be surmounted by
precisely that sector of the population least equipped to handle them, and allowing the
digitalised or biometric monitoring of claimants.


216
As whole strata of the population are cut off from support, potential social disorder
is kept in check by the technologically intensive policing applied against the poor, indigent
and ghettoised. Around those convicted of transgression, the web of informational control
tightens inexorably. Prisons, as Foucault so forcefully pointed out, have long been cutting-
edge sites for the development of surveillance techniques. What is not always remembered
is that the original panoptic apparatus that Foucault discussed in a carceral setting was at
first designed for use in a factory setting, as an instrument of capitalist work discipline.37 In
today’s high-technology penitentiaries, however, carceral and the capitalist logic come
together. In an increasing number of privatised or semi-privatised US prisons, inmates are
put to work for private corporations, often on electronic data-entry jobs or other forms of
telework, in a process that uses high-technology to neatly fuses the Crisis State’s drive to
minimise social expenditures with the corporate imperative to cut labour costs to the
bone.38
The net tendency is toward a return to the social conditions of the 19th century
overseen by the technologies of the 21st. However, this regression, bringing with it huge
increases in poverty rates, social polarisation and general human suffering, has catalyzed
opposition. In North America, immiseration erupted into rage in the Los Angeles rebellion
of 1992, the most violent urban insurrection in the US since the mid-19th century. As Mike
Davis notes, Southcentral LA, a "housing/jobs ghetto in the early twentieth century
industrial city," is now "an electronic ghetto within the emerging information city "-- a
"data and media black hole, without local cable programming or links to major data
systems."39 The rioters came from the ranks of the un- and under-employed, in a community
whose traditional sources of employment in the aerospace and automobile industries had


217
been gutted through automation and global relocation. This population, dependent on the
scanty welfare, casualised service work or criminal industries which constitute the
underside of the information economy, was on an everyday basis was subject to a regime
of draconian police surveillance and brutalisation--a regime whose systemic violence,
publicly exposed in the videotaped beating of Rodney King, finally triggered a mass
explosion.
Its outbreak, in the same city that saw the Watts riot of 1965, was a stunning
testimonial to the collapse of a quarter century of capitalist reformism. Framed by the
mainstream media simply as an issue of` race, the uprising was in fact, as Mike Davis
observed, a "multicultural bread riot" involving Latinos, blacks and whites. 40 Moreover,
although the riot was a spontaneous eruption of despair and anger, it was by no means the
blind, mindless event which authorities attempted to represent it as. A few days after the
uprising, there appeared the "Bloods/Crips Proposal for LA's Face-Lift," a radical,
visionary plan for the renewal of the city produced by the infamous street gangs. 41. This
document, almost entirely ignored by mainstream media made extensive proposals for
reconstructing the urban environment, and for the introduction of governmentally funded
educational, health, employment and even law enforcement measures to reverse the
disintegration of community.
Although the conditions of South Central Los Angeles gave the 1992 rebellion its
singularity, it would be wrong to see it simply as a`one-off' event. From the late 1980s to
today the intensifying destruction of social safety nets has brought into being a variety of
new "poor people’s movements," ranging from the squatters of Homes not Jails, to End
Legislated Poverty in Vancouver, to the encampments of homeless in New York.42 For


218
example, Food Not Bombs is a group whose activities in San Francisco led to over seven
hundred arrests from 1988 to 1994. In addition to running the on-street soup kitchens which
have aroused the ire of municipal government, it operates its own radio network, based
largely on low- watt broadcasting, produces its own audio tapes and has a World Wide
Web site. Through these channels it disseminates information excluded from the
mainstream press about the police harassment of its programs and the structural causes of
poverty.43
In Toronto, a coalition of trades unionists and anti-poverty groups have taken aim at
a contract between the Ontario government and a private company, Andersen Consulting, to
automate the delivery of welfare services. The coalition argues that this contract aims to
simultaneously eliminate social services staff (Andersen gets a `bounty’ for each job cut)
and to make the system increasingly inaccessible to claimants. The coalition has publicised
Andersen’s record of cost overruns and unfulfilled promises on similar contracts
elsewhere in North America, traced its involvement in the privatisation schemes of
authoritarian governments from Russia to Nigeria, and its links to the military industrial
complex. In addition to holding marches, pickets and civil disobedience actions at the
corporation’s offices, the “Andersen Conversion Project” is also bringing forward
proposals for the transformation of the high-tech company to more socially constructive
purposes.44 In such movements, anti-poverty groups, trades unionists and other social
movements take the first steps to turn the technologies developed at public expense back
against the panoptic alliance of state and corporate power.

Reproduction of Labour II: Capital’s Biopolitics 
 
The Crisis State’s regime of high-technology control is not restricted to the policing
of welfare lines and inner city streets. It extends further, into homes and hospitals, where
the informational restructuring of capital has been intimately associated with new
interventions into the reproduction of labour power at its most basic levels--motherhood,
birth, and, indeed, the basic biological constitution of human beings.
As was discussed in Chapter 4, autonomist Marxist’s have since the 1970s argued
that capital benefits from the unpaid reproductive work of women. The classic nuclear
family paired the waged male worker and unwaged female housewife in a relation where
role of the latter was to maintain, repair and reproduce the labour power of the former. The
male worker's wage thus commanded unrewarded labour time not only in the factory but
also in the home. This conjunction of masculine domination and capitalist exploitation was
challenged by the feminist revolt of the 1960s and 70s on a multitude of fronts; in the
exodus of women from unpaid domestic labour in search of waged work, in demands for
"wages for housework," in the rejection of the various medical and psychiatric controls
placed over housewives. Amongst the most important of these struggles was that over
abortion rights. Women asserted control over their own fertility and repudiated a `natural'
fate as the unwaged reproductive laborers of the social factory.
The reconsolidating of `family values' and the discrediting of feminism were thus a
logical part in the neoliberal offensive of the 1980s. Limitations on and recriminalisations
of abortion services; legal regulation of the pre-natal conduct of`unfit' mothers; experiments
in the sterilisation of welfare mothers by mandatory Norplant implants were all crucial
aspects of Reaganite and Thatcherite regimes.45 What is often not fully recognised is how


220
closely these apparently `cultural’ or `ideological’ aspects of the Crisis State were, in fact,
closely bound up with its economic policies. For as welfare services are degraded under
the austerity regime of the Crisis State, the resumption of the traditional female role as a
'voluntary' caregiver for the young, sick, and elderly becomes critical to prevent total
social disintegration. Although the means to this end include both `pro' and `anti-natalist'
tendencies, the common theme of these interventions is enhanced state control over
maternity--control exercised to ensure the `proper' management of procreation and to
reconstruct the household as a costless, reliable site for the reproduction of labour power.
At the same time, however, the most advanced sectors of knowledge-based capital
have been experimenting with an alternative system of system of maternal control--one
based on biotechnologies. Already, in vitro fertilisation, amniocentesis, embryo selection,
and artificial insemination are becoming the instruments for an extraordinary experiment--
the conversion of motherhood into a domain for the direct extraction of surplus value. As
feminists such as Maria Meis and Kathryn Russell have argued, the commercial application
of such techniques drives female `labour power'--in the procreative sense-- towards the
condition of abstraction, divisibility and alienation traditionally experienced in industrial
work.46 Reproductive engineering applies a technological deskilling strategy, classic in
form but unprecedented in intensity, comprehending both conscious knowledge and
corporeal capacity, detaching, permutating and recombining the various moments of
pregnancy until the unifying factor governing the conception, gestation and delivery of a
child is no longer maternal but managerial.
This is clearest in the so-called `surrogate mother' business--the ultimate in female
service sector labour--in which poor women are, through an entrepreneurial intermediary,


221
paid by rich clients to undergo either artificial insemination or in vitro fertilisation and
carry and bear children. 47 But such obviously exploitative repro-tech arrangements only
represent the extreme of tendencies evident even in more seemingly benign uses. For
example, women who voluntarily attempt in vitro fertilisation not only pay for the service,
but also, in a complex and painful process of self-surveillance and constant testing often
knowingly or unknowingly providing the surplus material --'excess eggs'-- required for
further commercial experimentation.48
Anti-abortion crusades and reproductive technology businesses seem antithetical,
one resting on a sacralisation of procreation, the other on its utilitarian industrialisation.
And there are indeed real contradictions between these strategies, and between the factions
of capital which promote them. But the two strategies of control are also intimately
connected. Both counter the reproductive autonomy fought for by women. The `family
values' campaign cancels `choice' in an outrightly reactionary manner. But the corporate
biotechnologists coopt it as the watchword for the commodification of procreation. Just as
in production capital combines sweated labour and robotics, so `family values' and genetic
engineering are poles in a single overarching regime of reproductive control, with
biotechnological options commercially available to the rich, and surrogate mothers drawn
from the ranks of the poor.
In the very near future, moreover, reproductive technologies promise a spectacular
convergence with genetic engineering--the splicing, cutting and recombination of the
genetic code. After a gradual postwar development, founded in North America upon heavy
state investment in basic research, these technologies have since the crisis of Fordism in


222
the 1970s undergone an extraordinary acceleration in commercial development as part of
capital’s overall search for post-industrial sources of investment.49
The capacity to rewrite the `code of life' has been applied to agricultural, food
production and plant breeding to produce new strains of plants, new forms of food and new
types of fertiliser. 50 Increasingly, however, genetic engineering has in its sights direct,
control over human behavior. As Gottweiss argues, the burst of state and corporate interest
in biotechnologies during the crisis of the social factory arose because in addition to
yielding traditional economic benefits, it was conceptualised as "a potential contribution to
a broader social stabilisation, mainly by its expanded capacity to control behavior and
bodies."51
Today, these ambitions crystallise around the Human Genome Project, the US state
sponsored attempt to map and sequence all the DNA of a `normal' human prototype--a
project comparable in cost and scope to the space program of earlier decades.52 This
project is generally promoted as a means of curing hereditary diseases. Eventually, this
dream may be realised, and, if it is, the biotechnology industry anticipates lavish profits
from the creation of new ways to improve health, longevity and pleasure for those who can
afford them. However, it is important to recognise that currently, genetic engineering's main
achievements are neither therapeutic nor even diagnostic but predictive, allowing the
probabilistic identification of conditions for which no known remedy presently or
forseeably exist. 53
Such techniques offer corporate and state managers a way, not of healing, but of
targeting subjects with an alleged predisposition to costly disease. 54 The identification of
`hypersusceptible' workers with supposed genetic sensitivity towards toxic chemicals or


223
radiation has in the US already become a significant source both of employment
discrimination and of exclusion from health insurance coverage.55 It also provides an alibi
for failure to eliminate such pollutants, which become redefined not as social hazards, but
as problems of individual predisposition, capable of being handled by genetically
`subsensitive' labour. Extensive genetic screening holds out the promise of comprehensive,
DNA-level quality control over the reproduction of labour power, control aimed not at the
cure of disease put at the discarding of potentially unproductive, oversensitive or
expensive units.56
As the Human Genome Project generates the raw data necessary for new
`breakthroughs' to enhance the human body, the combination of genetic screening with
reproductive technologies offers prospects for the renewal of a eugenic agenda once
thought to have been discredited with the fall of fascism. However, the commercial thrust
behind the biorevolution means that such a program would probably have a different `feel'
from its historical predecessors. As employment possibilities become increasingly
dependent on a clean genetic profile, or even on possession of certain bioengineered
enhancements, positive and negative selection will be left to the survival instincts and
pocket book of individuals. People may bio-technologically reproduce the labour power of
themselves and their children in the most saleable form affordable, in the context of an
increasingly stratified, privatised and expensive medical system-- a development whose
potential is already apparent in the burgeoning market for synthesised human growth
hormones, silicon breast implants, cosmetic surgeries, performance enhancing drugs and
transplantable hearts, livers, kidneys and corneas.57 Capital will thus move towards
establishing a hierarchy of labour powers in which the various class-ificatory grades are


224
distinguished not simply by education and training, or according to traditional
discriminations of gender and race, but according to fundamental bodily modifications.58
As Peter Linebaugh has pointed out, in origin, the term "proletarian" designated someone
who has no function but to reproduce themselves.59 In Marxist usage, this has
conventionally been understood as a person who has nothing to sell but their labour power.
Soon, however, it may be applied to someone whose only economic asset is their
gestational capacity and their genetic heritage.
However, the emergent neoliberal biopolitics has encountered widespread
resistance. In North America, much of this has centred on the revival of the women’s
reproductive-rights movements. In many cases, its nucleus is the network of abortion
clinics and women’s’ health centres, whose defence, both from the harassment,
firebombings and assassinations of the right-to-life movement and from the cut-backs of
neoliberal governments, has formed a focus of activism. Women have also attempted to
enlarge their own technological control over procreation, through campaigns such as that
waged in the US for access to the abortion drug, RU 486. However, largely through the
influence of poor women and women of colour, the anti-abortion movement has undergone
a strategic reorientation, sometimes described as a shift "from abortion to reproductive
freedom."60 An earlier emphasis on individual choice has, at least in some sectors of the
movement, been gradually replaced by an emphasis on securing the “social conditions
necessary for autonomous choice," on the provision of adequate health services, housing,
and wages and welfare for women, and on winning control over the research and
availability of medical technologies, including opposition to both compulsory fertility and
eugenic sterilisation,61


225
One aspect of this expanded agenda has been an intensive critique of the repro-tech
industry. International feminist alliances such as the Feminist International Network of
Resistance to Reproductive & Genetic Engineering have exposed the deceptive success
rate claimed by the in vitro fertilisation industry, its exploitation of female labour, the
misogyny of sex selection amniocentesis, and the eugenic potential of the new
technologies.62 They have argued that the `choices' offered by the biotechnologists in fact
erode female freedom because they, as Sue Cox puts it, "close off women's abilities to
refuse various kinds of technological intervention."63 In Canada, the attempt by the Royal
Commission on New Reproductive Technologies to suppress such lines of critique
exploded into public scandal.64 Other points of struggle have involved indigenous people,
in both North and South America, concerned with the ramifications of Human Genome
Diversity Project (known as the `vampire project') which has sampled and patented human
cell lines from endangered aboriginal communities.65
 Other groups, with different concerns, have found themselves on a similar
collision course with the neoliberal administration of health. In the face of alliance
between a state apparatus committed to the reduction and rationing of health care, and a
burgeoning, profit-oriented medical-industrial complex formed at the intersection
transnational medical, pharmaceutical, agricultural, insurance and computer corporations,
there have appeared what Patrick Novotny, writing of the environmental justice activism,
calls movements of "popular epidemiology."66 These movements often involve groups
marginalised by the industrial-medical complex--people of colour, women, gays and
lesbians. They challenge established expertise, demand additional allocations of funding,


226
question the priority of profits over people, reappropriate popular capacities for research,
and often seek systemic rather than palliative answers to the causes of ill-health.
A striking example is the extraordinary self-organisation of the anti-AIDS
movement. In the face of initially inept and callous governmental responses to the HIV
epidemic, organisations such as ACT UP and Project Inform attacked the state’s
underfunding of research, and its subordination to commercial purposes. They also
reshaped research agendas; amassed and circulated immunological and virological
information, both by computer networks and other means; investigated `alternative'
treatments; set up guerrilla clinics, smuggling rings and buyers clubs; clandestinely
manufactured commercially-patented drugs; and showed enormous sophistication in video-
activism and other forms of cultural agitation.67 Although these movements on occasion
cooperated with pharmaceutical companies, they simultaneously criticised these companies
unsparingly for either ignoring AIDS research, or attempting to extract superprofits from
new treatments. These points were underlined by dramatic demonstrations and occupations
against companies such as Hoffman Larouche, Boroughs Welcome, Kowa Pharmaceuticals,
and Astra. Peter Arno and Karen Felden describes the most famous of such actions, the
ACT-UP invasion the New York Stock Exchange protesting AZT price gouging:
 Seconds before the 9:30 am opening bell, the activists began to blare
portable foghorns . . . Fake $100 bills imprinted with the words `Fuck your
profiteering. We die while you play business' were tossed to the traders
below.68


227
Over the history of the anti-AIDS movement, these forms of activism, initially
concentrated in the white, male gay community, have become increasingly prominent in
movements of people of colour and women. In the process, AIDS has been recognised as a
disease of poverty, primarily afflicting those whom the disintegration of social
infrastructures, community networks, health-care and education render vulnerable. Anti-
AIDS struggles have thus been connected to campaigns for improved public health funding,
comprehensive medical insurance, and the reallocation of military spending.69
As Steven Epstein points out, anti-AIDS activism, which itself draws on the earlier
example of the women's health movement, is part of a widening circle of popular
mobilisations for the “democratisation” of medical technoscience.70 These movements
include those of women seeking to establish causal links between breast cancer and
industrial pollution; unions opposed to genetic screening and drug testing in the workplace;
and green activists, farmers and consumer groups concerned about the implications of
artificially mutated foodstuffs. Alongside these single-issue movements, and sometimes
intertwining with them in complex ways, are broader movements. These aim at preserving
the medical services once guaranteed by the welfare state, as in various Canadian
coalitions of hospital workers and community groups defending hospitals and clinics
against cuts, or at actively extending the socialisation of health care, as in the struggle over
health insurance in the US. All of these efforts run athwart the priorities of a state
committed primarily to containing social costs, and a corporate logic focused purely on the
profitability of life and death.


228
Reproduction of Labour III: The Corporate-Academic Complex
At the same time as the Crisis State dismantles the social welfare system, it
continues to maintain and enlarge the functions of government as a funding and coordinating
agency for capital’s technoscientific development. The demands of the information era
mean that even as schools, hospitals and social services deteriorate, business still—indeed
more than ever—demands literate workers, carefully socialised technicians and world-
class molecular biologists and software engineers. An integral part of the transition to a
post-Fordist model of accumulation has therefore been a major restructuring of public
education, a restructuring which has nowhere been more dramatic than in North American
universities.
Just as in the workplace, the restructuring of academia has unfolded through a
process of revolt and recuperation. Thirty years ago, campuses from California to Paris
were in tumult as the post-war generation of students-- the first mass draft of the
intellectually trained labour-power required by an ever-more socially-organised and
scientifically-oriented capitalism-- rose against the rigidities and atrocities of the Fordist
regime. After the tear gas, the shootings and academic purges, the neoliberal response was
radical restructuring. Over the late 1970s and 1980s rates of funding for university
education in most capitalist economies were cut. Tuition fees and student debt were
sharply raised, measures which, alongside a climbing unemployment rate and general
economic austerity, chilled student protest, while programs seen as subversive, or simply
as inutile to industry, were cut.


229
With campus unrest apparently quashed, conditions were set for a new, deeper
integration of universities and business, one vital to the development of high-technology
`knowledge industries.'71 The watchword was “corporate-university partnership.” In this
new academic order, basic research is sacrificed to applied programs of immediate benefit
to the corporate sector. Research parks, private sector liaisons, consultancies and cross-
appointments with industry, and academic-corporate consortiums burgeon. Moneys
subtracted from base operating budgets are reinjected back into programs of direct utility
to high technology capital, such as schools of communication, engineering and business
administration, and special institutes for computer, biotechnology and space research.
University administrators move effortlessly between interlocking corporate and academic
boards. Enabled by changes in intellectual property laws to exercise ownership rights over
patents resulting from government funded grants, universities become active players in the
merchandising of research results. Amidst this intensifying commercial ethos, the internal
operations of academia become steadily more corporatised, with management practices
mirroring those of the private sector.
This new rapprochement with academia has performed two purposes for capital.
First, it has provided business with the facilities to socialise the costs and risks of
extraordinarily expensive high-technology research, while privatising the benefits of the
innovations.72 Second, it has subsidised capital’s retraining of its post-Fordist labour-
force. Rising tuition fees devolve an ever increasing part of the costs of education onto
students and their families, effectively excluding from the universities those sectors of the
population whose intellectual advancement is considered irrelevant to accumulation. Those
that can pay for entry are trained, sorted and socialised for the new information economy


230
by increasingly vocational and technically oriented curricula that stress proficiencies in
computer literacy at the expense of critical social analysis.
However, the belief that campuses were pacified now appears premature. Rather,
the late 1980s and 1990s have seen the emergence of a new cycle of university struggles.73
As Robert Ovetz notes, this wave of unrest stems from numerous different but
interanimating sources.74 Of central importance is the mounting economic jeopardy in
which many students now find themselves. Higher education, rather than guaranteeing
personal success, serves to create a standing reserve army of intellectual labour, from
whom capital can cull the relatively small number of full-time employees required by the
`knowledge economy.' With rates of unemployment for college and university graduates
high, many find that years of study ensure only life-long and unpayable debt. These grim
prospects have led to a spate of protests against tuition increases, student aid cuts, and
skyrocketing debt loads.
These concerns interweave with a web of other campus protests: against program
closures; against commercial development of university lands; against involvement with
corporate investment in authoritarian regimes such as those of China or Indonesia.
Alongside these run demands by minorities and women for campus centres, daycares and
programs of multicultural and feminist studies. The net result has been a slowly mounting
campus turbulence, involving picket lines, demonstrations, occupations, national student
strikes in Canada and major confrontations between police and students on several North
American campuses. Indeed, as James Laxer observes, it is likely that in Canada more
students were actually `on the streets' in political protest in the mid-1990s than in the 1960s
and 70s.75


231
These student protests further overlap with an outburst of campus labour conflicts.
Following the overall downsising logic of post-Fordist capital, academic administrators
demand that workers must do more with--and for-- less. The one-time ivory tower
witnesses an intensification in the rate of exploitation. This logic is usually visited first,
and most severely, on the service workers--the clerical, administrative, janitorial and
cafeteria staff--who provide the indispensable infrastructure for the accumulation of
intellectual capital. But it eventually arrives at the door of university instructors. Teachers
experience increases in the pace and volume of work. A classic strategy of casualisation
decreases permanent hiring in favour of reliance on pools of sessional instructors and
graduate students who form a contingent academic labour force subjected to chronic
insecurity and lack of benefits, and required to exercise mind-bending flexibility in
pedagogic preparation.
This speed-up of academic production has produced a response that, while
shocking to academic traditionalists, would come as no surprise at all to workers in, say,
the auto industry. On many North American campuses, including some of the most
prestigious, regular university faculty are now unionised--something that would have been
largely unthinkable even a decade ago. Strikes by college instructors are no rarity.
Graduate students are now an important constituency for labour organising. Teaching
assistants' strikes have spread across North American campuses, involving institutions as
famous as Yale and scores of others.76
 The campus activism arising from this combination of factors has a very different flavour
from that of the 1960s and 70s--which for most of the participants in today's rebellions
belongs to a barely known and faintly mythic past. The revolts of thirty years ago


232
recognised and resisted the movement towards integration of the university "knowledge
factory" into advanced capitalism’s military-industrial complex. But the fact that this
assimilation was only partially completed, together with the relative affluence of the
period, gave these uprisings a certain removal from the world of the labour market.
Campuses could become temporary red ghettoes or autonomous zones; but there was a
fundamental divorce between what was experienced in these enclaves and the more
general conditions of work and exploitation.
Today, the near-total fusion of academia with business, and the manifest
subordination of education to the imperatives of the job-market, removes such relative
freedom. But it opens the way for connections between both students and instructors and
other waged and unwaged workers, making their conditions far closer to that of the rest of
the labour force. The conventional distinction so often made between university and the
`real' world, at once self-deprecating and self-protective, becomes less and less relevant.
If students and teachers consequently lose some of the latitude of action relative privilege
once afforded, they also become potentially participant in and connected to movements
outside the university, movements for whom academia can therefore also become a node
within the overall circulation of struggles.
Reproduction of Nature: Hazardous Wastes
To grasp the full scope of the opposition running around capital’s circuits,
however, it is necessary to look beyond struggles over work and wages, or and even over
welfare, health care and education. Capital mobilises technology to control not only


233
labour, nor society as a whole, but also nature itself. It needs not just workers but also raw
materials. As it reduces people to labour power, so it reduces nature to a resource: both
exist to be used up. And as capital as far as possible avoids paying for the reproduction of
labour power it exploits by devolving these costs onto households and communities, so to
it minimises its costs for the repair and restoration of the natural world by assuming that
these processes can be left to the regenerative powers of nature. For all that Marx often
participated in the scientific triumphalism of his century, he nonetheless clearly recognised
the dangers of this trajectory when he spoke of capitalism "simultaneously undermining the
original sources of all wealth--the soil and the worker."77 Today, amidst a global vista of
deforestation, desertification, dying oceans, disappearing ozone, and disintegrating immune
systems, the cost of this exhaustive process has become all too apparent, and ecological
issues constitute one of the main arenas in which popular movements confront corporate
power.
 Indeed, an eruption of such green movements was one aspect of the general crisis
of the Fordist social factory in the late 1960s and 1970s. As public awareness of the
damage wrought by radioactive emissions, industrial wastes and pesticide poisoning
mounted, capital found its freedom to `externalise’ costs by dumping poisons onto the
surrounding communities challenged by unfamiliar forms of resistance. At sites from
Diablo Canyon to Love Canal, environmental activists stormed fences and blockaded
gates, disrupting industrial mega-projects as effectively as labour unrest on the assembly
line.78 In one of the most notable large scale reverses inflicted on a large-scale capitalist
enterprise, development of the North American nuclear power industry was effectively
stalled by the ever rising costs of safety measures demanded by an anxious and angry


234
public.79 Across many other sectors of Fordist capital both the sheer depletion of easily
accessible natural resources and the growing resistance to corporate despoliation began to
constitute a serious barrier to accumulation.
The post-industrial leap into the world of computers, telecommunications and
biotechnologies was in part a response to this threat. As the arrival of high-technology on
the shop floor was accompanied by promises of liberation from work, so too was it
celebrated as the answer to the evils of pollution. Clean information systems would
replace industrial smokestacks, recycle wastes, reduce the use of fossil fuels, eliminate
paper from offices, replace motorcars with telecommuting, allow for better planning and
preservation of natural resources and dematerialise production into an innocuous flow of
bits and bytes. These promises became integral to a succession of strategies--`sustainable
development,' `Third Wave environmentalism,' `ecological modernisation.'80 All these
announce that technological surveillance, substitution and surrogacy will deflect ecological
apocalypse, enabling capital to manage the continued reproduction of nature by making a
move from mining nature to remodeling it-- shifting from stripping of nature to synthesising
it, recreating a world of artificially-generated resources to substitute for the gutted planet
left in the aftermath of industrialism. 81
The problem with such plans, however, is that they do nothing to touch the
relentless corporate drive to expand the circle of production and consumption. A system in
which the survival of each individual firm depends on its ability to enlarge its market,
regardless of collective consequences, capital remains committed to, as Marx put it,
"production for productions sake."82 In practice, therefore, high technology has been used
not so much to halt the destruction of nature but to increase the efficiency of the destroying


235
agencies, and circumvent opposition to their activities. Automobile factories,
petrochemical plants, and pulp mills have, amidst fanfare about green business, been made
more energy-efficient (and hence more profitable)-- but have not slackened their search for
expanded (and hence more ecologically punishing) global markets. The advanced synthesis
of substitutes for scarce natural materials has become a license for the anxiety-free
liquidation of vanishing animals, minerals and vegetables. Telecommunications and
transport networks have dispersed pollution away from centres of activism and regulation
onto the doorstep of those least likely to resist, making the shipment of toxic residues to
urban ghettoes, native reservations or the Third World a post-Fordist sunrise industry.
Moreover, in many cases, the capitalist development of so-called clean technologies,
pursued under the same cost-cutting, profit-maximising logic that produced enormities of
industrial pollution, replicate the very patterns of ecological destruction they purportedly
eliminate. The computer industry's use of toxic substances in microchip assembly, for
example, has made Silicon Valley home to the highest concentration of hazardous-waste
sites in the United States.83
Since the new technologies do not, of themselves, halt the devastation of the
environment, they also fail to stop green counter-movements. While schemes of high-
technocratic resource management have played a part in coopting mainstream
environmentalism, they have also unintentionally provoked new and radical opposition.
Thus in the US the intensification in the long-standing practice of dumping hazardous
wastes -- including postindustrial toxins -- on the most impoverished and vulnerable
sectors of labour has catalyzed the rise of an `environmental justice' movement in
communities of colour, traditional working class neighborhoods, Native Indian Lands, and


236
regions of the rural poor.84 Puerto Rican farm workers opposing pesticide poisoning,
tenants associations fighting oil and petrochemical industries in Lousiana's `Cancer Alley,’
mothers battling incinerators in Latino neighborhoods of East Los Angeles, and Latino and
African American students of the Toxic Avengers coalition fighting the transportation of
nuclear waste in Brooklyn have bought into being a new round of ecological struggles.85
Often led by women--whose unwaged reproductive labour deals with the miscarriages,
birth defects, and slow deaths created by corporate poisoning--and characterised by
strategies which unites class, gender and race issues, these groups have dramatically
challenged the elitism of traditional environmentalism, and engaged in a series of head-on
confrontations with corporate power.
Generating its own programs of self-education, community research, and
communication the environmental justice movement represents an astounding flowering of
popular science amongst the excluded and dispossessed. In many cases, sectors of the
movement pursues objectives going far beyond the established limits of regulation. Their
proposals for funds to support workers unemployed by the closing of ecologically
destructive enterprises, restrictions on capital flight, elimination of the production of toxic
substances, the development of a less polluting transport system, community economic
development, equitable distribution of cleanup costs, and international laws that protect the
environment and workers are, in fact, tantamount to demands for a radically new economic
system.86 .
One of the most important aspects of this movement has been its efforts to
overcome of the rifts between working class and ecological activism. Since the 1970s
capital, by playing-off `jobs versus the environment,' has constantly counterpoised labour


237
and ecological concerns, often successfully dividing red from green. However, as it
becomes clear that high-tech business destroys livelihoods at the same rate as it destroys
ecosystems, the falsity of this choice has become increasingly apparent. While the worker-
green split remains virulent, in some sectors groupings of industrial and resource workers
have developed their own environmental projects and entered into dialogue with
ecological activists.87
One notable instance involves workers in that most unlikely of industries,
automobile manufacturing. Throughout the 1980s an extraordinary coalition of black and
Latino trades unionists and community groups in Van Nuys, California, successfully
opposed General Motors's plan to close its local car plant by threatening a boycott in the
lucrative Los Angeles auto market.88 In 1992, the "Save GM Van Nuys" campaign was
finally defeated. However, it then underwent a dramatic metamorphosis, providing the
nucleus for the WATCHDOG Organising Committee -- a group combating corporate air
pollution of working class neighborhoods, and seeking the conversion of the auto industry
to clean, ecologically viable forms of production.89
These activists made connections with workers from the Caterpillar vehicle plant
in Toronto, who, following an unsuccessful attempt to prevent closure of their plant by
occupation, had entered into dialogue with environmental and anti-poverty groups to
devise a "greenworks" conversion campaign.90 This alliance has in turn linked with
Japanese workers from a joint Toshiba--Amplex high-technology enterprise, where
resistance to plant closure led to an eight-year factory occupation.91 During this time the
workers not only continued to manufacture and market high-tech media, educational,
medical, and industrial operation systems, but ultimately started to redesign these products


238
in order to meet their own criteria of social and ecological environmental responsibility. 92
They were supported in these efforts by the Japanese peace and anti-nuclear movements,
for whom they produced portable loudspeakers for demonstrations, a citisens' Geiger-
counter, and another special radiation detector, funded by popular contribution, made for
the victims of the Chernobyl disaster at half the cost of commercial systems.
Taken in conjunction with the movements against genetic commodification
described earlier, such worker-green alliances introduce an extraordinary dimension to
struggles against information capital. For what is a stake in such initiatives is nothing less
than what Marx termed humanity's "species being"--its capacity to consciously direct its
own development as a biological collectivity.93 The issue today is whether this shaping
will be determined by capitalist command and market forces, or by broader social logics.
In this sense, proletarian struggles, which have, today, become struggles in which people
strive to collectively assert a self-determining power over the development of the human
species and its natural environment, potentially resume all the universalistic significance
that Marx once attributed to them.
Movements fighting at different points on capital’s circuit--against workplace
exploitation, dissolution of the welfare state, or ecological despoliation--have begun to
enter into alliances with each other, creating radical new combinations. The great difficulty
facing these struggles, however, remains their fragmentation and separation. Occurring at
different points within a vast social factory, and facing different facets of capitalist power,
the obstacles confronting the coordination of demands and actions are often prodigious.
Moreover, while these movements have a deep-level underlying interest in contesting the
corporate subsumption of society, this common ground can easily be obscured by more


239
local, but more apparent contradictions between them--conflicts between unionists and
welfare recipients, workers and environmentalists. Since capital constantly incorporates
these local contradictions its hierarchical organisations of control, both in and beyond the
workplace, its capacity to divide and conquer, isolating points of opposition and turning
them one against another is truly formidable. Paradoxically, however, although
informational capital enjoys extraordinary opportunities to overwhelm and disperse its
opponents, some of the very technological instruments it deploys to these ends also assist
counter-movements to overcome this fragmentation. It is to this process that we now turn.
Circulation I: Interactive Media
An explosive proliferation of technologies of communication, from telephone, radio
and broadcast television, through fax, video camera, VCRs, cell  phones, cable and
satellite television to computer networks, is one of--some would say the—most prominent
features of advanced capitalism today. As Fredric Jameson has observed, there is a
tendency to identify the benefits of the new media and the virtues of the free market, with
each legitimating the other—new communications technologies being praised for
accelerating economic growth, and the market exalted for promoting the free flow of
information.94 Yet there is another side to this dynamic. For amongst the new oppositional
movements whose emergence we are charting, alternative uses of all types of advanced
communication technologies are becoming a widespread and important element.
To examine this dialectic, it is necessary to move beyond analysis of the production
of commodities, the reproduction of labour-power, or the destruction of the environment,


240
and look at how capital circulates in the marketplace. If it is in the workplace that capital
extracts surplus value, it is in the market that this value must be realised through the sale of
commodities.95 Marx repeatedly emphasised that capital had a tendency to integrate these
two moments in its circuit, expanding the circle of consumption to match the growing
volume of goods its produced, and decreasing the turnover time by accelerating the speed
with which goods passed from production to consumption.96
In the course of the twentieth century, these requirements have become the basis for
a massive project of social engineering--the creation of a consumer society. Capital
discovered that, as work requires a labouring subject, so the market requires a consuming
subject, a subject that needs what capital produces and believes that these needs can and
must be satisfied in commodity form. And as in production it develops automatic
machinery to reduce and control subjects in their tasks as workers, so in the market it also
finds instruments to target and direct subjects in their tasks as consumers--a task performed
by ever more sophisticated waves of media technology.
 As so many commentators have pointed out, this commercial development of the
means of communication has momentous consequences for public speech.97 Whether
through explicit editorial intervention, journalistic self-censorship, or the demographic
imperatives of advertising, market-driven media tend to filter out news and analysis
critical of capitalism. This filtration is done with a gross mesh, not a fine one, and is less
absolute than the more monolithic models of capital’s “media monopoly” sometimes
suggest.98 Competition amongst various media capitals, or frictions between media empires
and other factions of capital, not to mention the occasional refusal of individual journalists
or artists to submit to managerial control, mean that something usually escapes.


241
Nevertheless, the corporate ownership of the major organs of societal communication tends
towards a situation in which, in Marx's classic formulation, "the ruling ideas are nothing
more than the ideal expression of the dominant material relationships"--in this case, an air-
brushed affirmation of the rightness and normality of omnipresent commodity exchange.99
This integration of media into capital’s subsumption of society first reached a high
level of consolidation in the era of the mass worker. Mass production and mass
consumption met in the virtuous circle of Fordism. Broadcast media became indispensable
components of this regime, deluging society with the advertising that trained the populace
in widespread consumption of standardised commodity goods. In the living rooms of North
America the radio and then the television set became the domestic entry point for the same
commodifying and conforming capitalist logic that in the factory drove the assembly line
and the time-and-motion study.100
However, the revolts of the 1960s and 1970s shattered the stability of this
arrangement. The rejection of the Fordist factory regime manifested in movements which,
as well as demanding better standards of living, asserted diverse needs for self-expression.
Social rebellion went hand in hand with experimentation in music, dress, drugs and art.
The cultural tumult of the era exploded the homogeneity of the mass market. When capital
reimposed social discipline through austerity, driving down wages and polarising incomes,
not only work but also consumption had to be restructured. One crucial element in this was
a major expansion of media industries.
From the late 1970s to the present there have appeared on the market a profusion of
new communications devices--cable and satellite TV, VCR's, camcorders, and personal
computers. Deployed beneath the mantle of increasingly concentrated, vertically and


242
horisontally integrated media empires, these technologies have been announced as marking
a new era of choice, liberation, and personal fulfillment. 101 In practice, they have
accomplished two corporate purposes. First, they have provided the channels for an
explosive growth of markets for entertainment and information. Here, as on the shopfloor,
capital has advanced by harnessing the energy unleashed against it. The desire for cultural
diversity, subversively expressed in the 1960s, has over the subsequent decades been
subjected to an unrelenting commodification, converting rock music, fashion, style,
personal growth and popular culture into highly variegated zones of vertiginous
commercial development.102
This skyrocketing commodification of culture has been vital as a compensation for a
flagging growth in other sectors. In the polarised post-Fordist economy, even those who
can no longer look forward to buy a house or car can still pay for a CD or cable, while
those who already have more residences and vehicles than they need can be persuaded to
spend on computers and electronic goods. Moreover, the high rates of obsolescence that
obtain in these fields--almost instantaneous in cases of evanescent soft goods songs, films
and video, scarcely less so in the ever changing electronic equipment--means that there is
little risk of saturating markets.
Second, the new media not only create fresh cultural commodities, but also permit
extraordinary refinements in marketing other products. Here a central element in the
restructuring of capital has been a huge increase in expenditures on advertising, sales
promotions and direct marketing.103 As the Fordist mass market was fragmented by falling
wages and social polarisation, corporations sought both to internationalise sales, and to
segment them, stimulating hyper-consumption amongst the relatively thin strata of well-paid


243
workers to compensate for the limited consumption capacity of the poor and unemployed.
New media systems, such as cable and satellite television channels are eminently suited to
this purpose. They both enlarge audiences (sometimes on a potentially global basis) and
make possible this ever more precise targeting of consumers differentiated by taste and
income.
This prospect is enhanced by the promise of various kinds of `interactive’ media--
systems such as computerised video-on-demand or teleshopping, which, unlike
unidirectional broadcasting, involve some degree of two-way transaction between receiver
and transmitter. One common but under-publicised feature of such systems is their capacity
to transmit back to the corporate provider detailed information about consumers' identities,
location, consumption habits, and daily schedule.104 Integrated with other electronic traces
left by point-of-sale devices, credit card scanning, billing and subscription records and
direct polling, this allows the compilation of comprehensive profiles of consumer
behavior. Such data then forms the basis for the highly targeted, demo- and psycho-graphic
micro-marketing required by the increasingly stratified and hierarchical organisation of
consumption. Furthermore, this data can be fed back into systems of flexibly-specialised
production and just-in-time inventory control designed for rapid response to shifting market
conditions. Interactive media thus hold out the promise of what Kevin Wilson terms "a
truly cybernetic cycle of production and consumption."105
The implications of this situation were perhaps best recognised two decades ago
when Dallas Smythe suggested that the watchers of TV, in "learning to buy," effectively
"worked" for advertisers.106 Electronic capital's expanding media reach meant it exploited
not just labour power in the factory but also "audience power" in the home.107 As the home


244
entertainment centre becomes the conduit not only for an incoming flow of corporate
propaganda but also for an outgoing stream of information about its viewers, this analysis
grows in credibility. The level of surveillance in the home tends toward that already
experienced in the workplace, and the activity of the waged "watchman" in the automatic
factory, described by Marx, becomes integrally linked with the unpaid "watching time"
which s/he passes in front of the television.108 The rate of surplus value extraction,
dependent on the exploitation of labour power, and the velocity of circulation, dependent
on the carefully targeted consumption capacity of the media audience, merely measure
different moments in a continuous, overarching, internally differentiated but increasingly
unified process of valorisation.
However, analyses such as Smythe's often assume capital's intended exploitation of
audience-power is fully successful. From my perspective, the more interesting question is
how it fails. If audience power is today analogous to labour power, then it too is a
disobedient subjectivity that evades, resists, and reshapes technological controls. There is
now extensive evidence that viewers, listeners and readers do not passively accept
hypodermic injection with narcotic messages, but are rather active agents who engage in
thousands of little lines of flight and fight--from turning off advertisements to the
oppositional reinterpretation of programs and the creation of micro-networks of
decommodified cultural activity.109
 At the very time when innovations in communication are becoming the basis for
vast commercial empires, there is apparent an opposite tendency that flouts the logic of the
market. People are using the new technologies to get or give out information for free:
reproducing, transmitting, sampling and reconfiguring without respect for commercial


245
property rights. This is known as `piracy.' And it is prevalent. As access to the new
communication machines becomes more and more thoroughly socialised, we see a wave of
photocopying, home taping, bootlegged videos, copied software, zapping, surfing,
descrambling, and culture jamming. Moreover, an increasingly wide variety of groups and
movements are using this generalised availability of communication technologies not
simply for individual but for collective purposes.
This manifests in the development of `alternative' or `autonomous' media.110 Such
experiments first blossomed during the 1960s and 1970s in a wave of radio-activism,
guerrilla video, and public access cable movements.111 Despite enormous difficulties they
have persisted. Radio-activism has continued and spread, reinvigorating itself in North
America by the proliferation of inexpensive, low power, and usually illegal microwatt FM
broadcasting by ghetto communities, squatters and the homeless.112 Oppositional video-
making has passed from the avant-garde to common practice amongst social movements.113
New areas of activism have opened around television, with the attempts in the US and
Canada to create and sustain public access cable--a medium whose political potential has
been developed by the Paper Tiger Television collective and its satellite broadcasting
Deep Dish project.114 Lack of resources mean that in most cases the reach of such
experiments is limited and their aspirations only very partially realised. But, however
raggedly, alternative media do posit something different from, and opposed to, capital's
mobilisation of "audience power."
Corporate interactivity is ratificatory: it posits dialogue only within the preset
limits of profitability. Autonomous media, on the other hand, are, as Rafael Roncaglio puts
it, "alterative"--probing the limits of established order.115 Their practice often includes


246
projects of self-representation, involving subjects in the definition and documentation of
their own social experience. They attempt to overcome the restrictions of technical
expertise characteristic of capital's division of labour. They experiment with forms of
collective ownership. Above all, alternative media often give a voice to precisely those
who are excluded or silenced by the commercial logic of market-driven information
industries--either because they are not demographically desirable or because they are
politically suspect.
 
Thus, looking back for a moment at the Los Angeles riots of 1992, one remarkable
aspect of the uprising was the degree to which the insurrectionaries were able to turn some
elements of capital’s high technology surveillance and media apparatus to their own
advantage.116 The uprising was, of course, ignited precisely by a classic instance of
counter-surveillance --George Halliday's videotaping of Rodney King's beating, and the
recording of incriminating police radio conversations. But even before the rebellion, its
idiom of anger had already been disseminated by the high-tech cultural inventions of the
ghettoised community--hip hop and rap, music whose political significance was neatly
demonstrated by President Clinton’s subsequent public attack on rap artist Sister
Souljah.117
During the riot, the omnipresence of the corporate media, covering the most
televised urban uprising in history, had an ambiguous effect: although its representations
frequently demonised and distorted the motives of the insurrectionaries, it could not
entirely avoid giving voice to their outrage.118 Simultaneously, a variety of autonomous
media, ranging from microwatt radio stations in ghettoised neighborhoods--such as the
famous Zoom Black Magic Liberation Radio--to computer networks connecting activists in


247
North America to others in Europe, spread a wider range of news, analysis and debate
ignored by mainstream media.119 All this contributed to the circulation of supporting riots
and demonstrations in Atlanta, Cleveland, Newark, San Francisco, Seattle, St. Louis, and
Toronto, and to the perception of the riot as an indictment of the social policies of the Bush
administration.120
Autonomous media have also played a significant part in less explosive but more
protracted forms of struggle, such as the new waves of labour activism. In Los Angeles
again, in an episode sometimes referred to as "the riot that didn't happen," Latino and
Chicano janitors and maids fighting for a first contract in the hotel industry won a
significant victory by threatening to circulate video evidence of abysmal working
conditions to potential convention guests.121 In Las Vegas, workers involved in struggle
with the entertainment giant MGM used similar “guerrilla media” tactics.122 The use by
trades unions of video and film for activist training, worker self-education and public
campaigning has become commonplace. In various US and Canadian cities, this media
activism has to the establishment of regular labour programming on community cable and
radio stations.123 This sort of activity is systematically fostered by organisations such as the
Labor Video Project, which also works to connect North American efforts in this field to
similar initiatives globally.124
These examples are only a part of a much wider circle of oppositional media
activities. Other instances that could be cited, some of which will be examined in later
chapters of this book, include the efforts of alternative media during the Persian Gulf War;
the mobilisation of support for political-activist prisoner Mumia Abu Jamal, accomplished
almost entirely through alternative radio, press, video and computer links; the Vancouver-


248
based `Adbusters' attempt to infiltrate commercial channels with "subvertisments”; and the
international computer networking associated with the transcontinental opposition to the
North American Free Trade Agreement, the Zapatista revolution and the campaign against
the Multilateral Agreement on Investment.125
Indeed, surveying the scope of this dissident media activity, it appears that capital,
in developing its media apparatus, has let the genie out of the bottle. Just as, by
computerising the factory, capital has not so much destroyed labour as dispersed it out into
the wider social sphere, so by wiring the household it has not necessarily consolidated
control over audiences. Rather, in its drive to extend the scope of the market, it has so
thoroughly disseminated and made familiar the technical means of communication as to
open the door to a series of individual and collective reappropriations. This means that on
occasion corporate control can be interrupted, and spaces opened within which a
multiplicity of social movements, all in different ways contesting the dominance of the
market, can be connected and made visible to each other. New information technologies
therefore appear not just as instruments for the circulation of commodities, but
simultaneously as channels for the circulation of struggles.
Circulation II: Struggles in Cyberspace
Today, some of the most dramatic manifestations of this contradiction appear in
cyberspace, that notional dimension constituted by flows of electronic data within
computer networks. In post-Fordist capital, these digital flows are used by “virtual
corporations” to link automated machines to just-in-time inventory systems, connect
dispersed production sites, accumulate and mine data about consumer tastes and habits, and


249
forge new marketing opportunities, coordinating these activities on a global scale and as
swiftly dispersing them.126 Indeed, it is in cyberspace that capital is now to attempting to
acquire a comprehensive command, control and communications capacity allowing it to
“appropriate, along with labour, the entire network of social relations.” 127 And yet at the
same time it is also in this virtual realm that some of the most remarkable experiments in
communicational counter-power are being conducted.
Computer-mediated-communications, created by the linking of computers and
telecommunications, were originally designed under military auspices, initially as part of
the US nuclear war fighting preparations, and later to connect the supercomputing centres
vital to Pentagon research. These origins have led many on the left to see the development
of such networks simply as a quintessential expression of capital’s technological
domination. However, there is another side to this process. In an entirely unforeseen
development, the technoscientific labour employed in the sites of the military-academic-
industrial complex--faculty, systems managers, and especially graduate students--extended
the network far beyond its original scope, using it for non-military research, designing
successive layers of alternative systems which connected into the main backbone. This
accretion of self-organised services proceeded, with the complicity of systems managers
enchanted by the technological `sweetness' of the results, until, as Peter Childers and Paul
Delany put it "the parasites had all but taken over the host."128
 
Strangely, in the era of that supposedly marked the triumph of the free market, the
most technologically advanced medium for planet-wide communication was in fact created
on the basis of state support, open usage and cooperative self-organisation. A proliferation
of autonomous activity transformed a military-industrial network into a system that in many


250
ways realises radical dreams of a democratic communication system: omni-purpose, multi-
centred, with participants transmitting as well as receiving, near real-time dialogue, a
highly devolved management structure, and-- since universities and other big institutions
have so far paid a flat rate for connection--offering relatively large numbers of people
access for little or no cost. On this basis there emerged the unplanned explosion of popular
interest in computer networking which by the late 1980s had catapulted the Internet on a
trajectory of exponential growth totally unforeseen by corporate planners.
Capital is now of course attempting to contain this outbreak of unanticipated
popular inventiveness—most significantly through the US government's National
Information Infrastructure initiative, with its plan for a publicly subsidised but corporately
owned and operated information superhighway. Such a system would rationalise the
already-existing but tangled web of fibre optic, cooper wires, cable radio waves and
satellites that provide the basis for telecommunications, cellular technologies and cable
television into a comprehensive, integrated network. Many companies are interested in this
highway for internal purposes: to connect customers with suppliers, improve monitoring of
employees, eliminate jobs, cut travel costs and gather competitive data. The giants of the
information and entertainments sector, however, see unprecedented market opportunities.
Telephone, cable, video and software companies a preparing to colonise cyberspace with
their `killer' applications--video-on-demand, tele-gambling, pay-per-computer games and
info-mercials. To many, the so-called highway running across the electronic frontier seems
closer to the late nineteenth century US railway development, complete with informational
`robber barons.’


251
However, cyberspace remains an arena of contradictions, in which capital's
development is both opposed and spurred by alternative initiatives. To create and operate
computer systems, commerce has had to summon up whole new strata of labour power,
ranging from computer scientists and software engineers, through programmers and
technicians, to computer-literate line and office workers, and ultimately to whole
populations relegated to tedious, mundane jobs yet required to be sufficiently computer-
literate to function in a system of on-line services and electronic goods. As this virtual
proletariat emerges, there also appears a tension between the potential interest and
abundance it sees in its technological environment, and the actual banality of cybernetic
control and commodification.
As so often before, new forms of conflict appear first under the guise of criminality
and delinquency--in this case, as `hacking.' If, following Andrew Ross, we define hacking
simply as the "unauthorised use of computers," then the term embraces computerised
sabotage; the reappropriation of work time to play games or write novels, or exchange
unauthorised email; so-called crimes of data copying, electronic trespass and information
dissemination; and unofficial experimentation with and alteration of systems up to and
including the invention of new machines and of alternative electronic institutions.129 These
activities are now giving capital's managers multiple headaches over loss of productivity,
theft of trade secrets, cybernetic revenge by terminated workers, and violations of
intellectual property laws.130
Moreover, the networks are now the site for an array of "virtual communities."131
These experiments in on-line social relations vary enormously; staggering diversity is
perhaps their preeminent feature. However, in many cases participants see such


252
communities as offering escape from the everyday logic of capital. In some cases, they are
consciously conceived as constituting a new, electronic form of civil society in which
many-to-many cybercommunications undermines the control of established societal
gatekeepers--including the giant media corporations--over flows of information. Indeed,
amongst libertarian technophiles these prospects sometimes inspire a populist version of
technologically-determinist information-revolution theory, with computer networks being
seen as the solvent that will spontaneously melt the hierarchies of capital into participatory
democracy.132
Faced with such propositions, many on the left have responded with buckets of cold
water. Marxian critics not only stress the Internet's military-industrial roots (the sure mark
of original sin) but point to the real demographic limitations on access to personal
computers, modems and technical expertise which sharply segregate computer access,
partly by gender, race, and age, but most sharply by income.133 Feminists, noting the
obstacles of time, money, socialisation, education and harassment that discourage the
involvement of women with the Internet, have also often been skeptical about its
emancipatory potential.134 Noting that the most likely owner of a personal computer and
modem is male, white, middle aged and affluent, such critics characterise “virtual
communities” as little more than elitist playgrounds of the privileged --the cyberspatial
equivalent of walled suburban communities. Observing the corporate drive to market on-
line, pay-per services these commentators anticipate the overrunning of free cyber-spaces
by commercial development, increasing stratification of information rich and information
poor, and relentless state and corporate surveillance. Confronting these prospects, they
write-off the alleged radical potentials of virtuality as rampant cyber-idealism.135


253
The actual dynamics of cyberspace are, however, more complex than either the
virtual communitarians or their critics allow. The relatively privileged status of most
(though by no means all) regular inhabitants of cyberspace undoubtedly limits the
likelihood of mass subversive uses. There are, however, countervailing factors. Capital's
omnipresent deployment of computers as work-tools and consumer goods, and the
extraordinary pace of planned obsolescence in this field, is making some of the basic
equipment for networking quite easily available. Significant numbers of people still have
free or cheap access via universities, schools and businesses. Moreover, in a political
context organisational access--the ability of a movement or group to receive and send
networked information, which can then be further distributed via more traditional methods-
-may be a more critical factor than individual ownership of computers.
Even a rapid survey of the Internet reveals that today it is used by a remarkably
wide variety of oppositional groups to by-pass the filters of the information industries,
speed internal communication, send out `action alerts,' and connect with potential allies.
Looking for the moment just at North America, we see diverse forms of network activism:
mailing lists such as ACTIV-L, LEFT-L, PEN-L (the Progressive Economists Network),
news groups such as P-NEWS, and World Wide Web sites for a wide variety of social
movements. This cyber-organising has included the construction of independent networks
which interface with the Internet but are entirely devoted to social activism, like the
Association for Progressive Communications, which arose in the mid-1980s from the
coalition of Peace-Net, Eco-Net and Conflict-Net and now constitutes a global computer
system dedicated to peace, human rights, labour and environmental issues.


254
Such networks mark the latest phase in the emergence of the autonomous media that
described earlier. Some social movements have been far swifter to establish a presence in
cyberspace others. Environmental groups, some of which contain many relatively affluent
professionals familiar with computers, and student campaigns, which often benefit from
their members’ free access to the Internet, have been early and frequent users. Women
remain significantly underrepresented, but there are nevertheless numerous feminist lists
and newsletters. Even if on the left the networks remain to some a degree a boy-toy, they
nevertheless frequently carries messages mobilising support for the protection of abortion
clinics, the defence of lesbian activists threatened by right wing violence, the prevention of
domestic violence, and the struggles of women workers. Organisations such as the APC
have launched projects specifically aimed at supporting the use of computer networking by
women from the popular sectors.136
It is impossible here to survey the entire range of this cyberspatial activism. But we
can get some sense of its growing importance by briefly looking at trades unions
developing involvement in this sphere. So-called `organised' labour has been relatively
slow to enter cyberspace, perhaps because of an abiding view of technology as a
managerial domain. Nonetheless, as Eric Lee has recently made clear in his study, The
Labour Movement and the Internet, this picture has been changing rapidly.137 The early
1980s saw the establishment of the first local North American “labournet,” in Canada, by
the British Columbia Teachers’ Federation.138 The subsequent decades have seen major
`Labortech' conferences; the initiation of lists such as LABOR-L and networks such as
Labour Net; and a burgeoning of North American union-affiliated bulletin boards, run by
teachers, firefighters, plumbers, communication and public service workers, musicians,


255
and journalists.139Some, such as the Canadian Union of Public Employee's Solinet, are now
well established. Several have connection to similar networks outside North America --
Glasnet in Russia, WorkNet in South Africa, Geonet in Germany, and Poptel in the United
Kingdom.140
The relation of these networks to the internal organisation of trades unions varies.
In many cases, computer communications are used simply to speed and make more efficient
traditional trades union industrial relations practices. Sometimes, access to networked
information has clearly been structured to reinforce internal bureaucracy and hierarchies.
But on occasion, debates in the networks have in fact become forums for unexpected
debate, dissent or rank and file initiatives.141
Moreover, in some recent struggles net-workers have taken the offensive on-line in
highly original ways. For example, in the Justice for Janitors campaign in Silicon, strikers
attempted to build links across the divide separating the `service’ and `scientific’ strata of
Silicon Valley, using the very means of communication produced by the companies with
whom they were locked in struggle. With the help of a small number of sympathisers
amongst the core professional staff, they found the email addresses of employees at Oracle
corporation, posted information about the exploitation of contract workers, and encouraged
their readers to protest the issue to management. They also disseminated news of the strike
through the Internet, inviting `netisens’ to complain to senior company officers and
providing email addresses. This was severely embarrassing to firms such as Apple whose
profitability substantially depends on maintaining a benign public image amongst
computer-users. One participant in this email campaign describes it as follows;


256
They had no idea how many people we were sending to . . . They started
answering, "We are not beating our janitors" and it turned out they were
beating them, really. Once they started with those answers then people
started to ask questions and it created a climate of heightened awareness of
what the janitors were doing, though it was not easily visible . . . The costs
of bad publicity, of morale being influenced by email are major. . for
people like us who live in that world to sense the communications
opportunity that exists right now--that email can be used to penetrate
barriers that exist for more conventional communications--was rather
exciting. Maybe after a while they'll set up filters and they'll get to keep all
of our messages out, but we'll be engaged in a lot of measures and counter
measures to keep communicating in that fashion . . . I think it's a creative
way to use the technology of the industry to undermine the social
relationships that have been built into it.142
A similar incident involves the newspaper industry, a business that has felt the full
weight of capital's drive to deskill, automate and shed labour. In 1994, some 2,600
workers from eight unions struck San Francisco's two daily papers. During the strike they
produced their own paper --the San Francisco Free Press. This was not only distributed
within the city, but was also made electronically accessible via World Wide Web, thus
making it probably the most widely circulated strike bulletin in the history of civilisation.
At the same time, the strikers initiated a boycott of companies that continued advertising


257
with newspapers behind picket lines. A computer list, Left-L, posted daily lists of "scab
advertisers," and encouraged subscribers to call these corporations' 1-800 phone numbers
with complaints. This boycott call appears to have been successful, with many companies
discontinuing advertising, and others having their advertisements run for free as the
newspaper proprietor's desperately attempted to save face. The eventual settlement was
widely seen as a victory for the strikers - an unusual moment in recent US labour history.143
Subsequently other labour struggles have pursued similar tactics. 144 However,
perhaps of even greater importance than this use of the nets as a weapon against employers
is the potential they open for connection and dialogue amongst movements. Sharing a
common cyberspace--such as the widely used Canadian Solinet network--enables
participant from different sectors of the labour movement to familiarise themselves with
each other concerns. But this process extends beyond the scope of the labour movement.
Lists like ACTIVE-L, the major North American activist forum, carry messages from
labour, environmental, feminist, indigenous groups. Sharing such an electronic forum
implicitly asserts these movements’ interconnections even while participants may still be
searching for the explicit formulation of such links. One of the main trade union networks,
LaborNet, is housed by the same organisation, the Institute for Global Communication,
which supports major environmental, human rights and peace networks, a situation which
encourages shared initiatives and informational cross-overs.
 Indeed, just as by creating a common medium for capitalist transactions
digitalisation drives toward the merging of once distinct industries, so it creates a
momentum for what Jim Davis terms a "popular digital convergence" amongst different
sectors of social labour.145 Organisations that fought separately for community access to


258
cable television or the employment conditions of phone workers or the artistic rights of
musicians and writers now find in their common concern around the "highway" a "new,
practical basis for working together."146 In combination with other autonomous media, such
networks provide a channel within which a multiplicity of oppositional forces, diverse in
goals, varied in constituency, specific in organisation, can, through dialogue, criticism and
debate, discover a new language of autonomy and alliance. In this sense, cyberspace is a
potentially recompositional space in which the atomisation that information capital inflicts
on socialised labour can be counteracted.
Of course, capital is now trying to reabsorb the unruliness of the networks through
the corporate information highway drive, an electronic law and order crackdown, and a
vast moral panic over pornography, terrorism and other evils on the Net.147 The brief
blossoming of the Internet may well, as Herbert Schiller prophecies, be swiftly "paved
over”, like the populist initiatives that marked the early days of radio, cable television and
earlier generations of communication technologies.148 However, it is also possible that this
familiar pattern of capitalist recuperation may encounter unexpected problems in the case
of computer communication. There are real questions as to whether there is actually
sufficient popular demand for commercial projects such as video-on-demand or
teleshopping to warrant the enormous investments that the highway demands. All
indications are that what people want from the on-line environment is global, communal
conversation rather than digital consumer services--in Negri's terms, "communication"
rather than "information."149 To the degree that capital stifles or excludes this possibility, it
risks killing the digital goose whose golden eggs it is already counting.


259
The most adventurous sections of information age business--such the cyber-
libertarians of the Electronic Frontier Foundation--gamble that they can avoid this impasse
by entering into a symbiotic relation with Internet culture, benefiting from the experiments
of virtual community constructors, the challenges of hackers, and the widespread interest in
two-way communication to spur technological development and perfect a new round of
digitally based accumulation. However, such a strategy requires corporate capital to
preserve a degree of openness within the networks, and to allow at least some continued
spaces for alternate digital institutions and experiments. In this case, the networks will
continue to serve as a medium not simply for the circulation of commodities, but also for
the circulation of struggles.
Cyberspace is important as a political arena, not, as some postmodern theorists
suggest, because it is a sphere where virtual conflicts replace struggles `on the ground,' but
because it is a medium within which terrestrial struggles can be made visible to and linked
with one another.150 Of course, this process is fraught with pitfalls. The European Counter-
Network, an autonomist network circulating news of struggles by workers, refugees, and
anti-fascists within the EEC notes the potential hazards of such computer activism:
technical fetishism, new hierarchies of expertise, health risks, and the "ultimate nightmare,"
. . . a simulated international radical network in which all communication is
mediated by modems and in which information circulates endlessly
between computers without being put back into a human context.151
As Dorothy Kidd and I have written elsewhere,


260
Attempts to use computers . . . in the struggle require constant, collective
reevaluation, to determine which strategies are effective, and which
dangerously compromised.152
Given such ongoing reassessment, however, there is plausible hope that computer
networking can help constitute new forms of anti-capitalist combination that do not rest on
the directives of a vanguard party, but rather arise out of the transverse, transnational
connections of oppositional groupings.153
Virtual Commune
It is widely known that in the aftermath of the 1848 proletarian uprisings in Paris,
the Emperor Napoleon III ordered Baron von Haussmann to redesign the city, and that a
centerpiece of this urban reconstruction was the widening of streets to allow the passage of
artillery for the suppression of any future insurrections. What is less well known is that
workers employed on this highway development project, impoverished masons and
builders housed in squalid Parisian slums, were leading participants in the next
revolutionary outbreak--the 1871 Paris Commune that seized the city in its entirety, rocking
the stability of capitalist Europe, and giving Marx a blazing, prefigurative glimpse of
communist society.154
Today, in the era of the information highway, capital is constructing its cyberspatial
thoroughfares to circumvent or overwhelm the industrial conflicts that once brought it to


261
crisis. Proceeding through its circuit we have seen it deploying high technologies to crush
all traces of opposition-- enforcing availability for work, commodifying ever-larger areas
of experience, deepening social controls and intensifying the depletion of ecosystems.
Capital has not, however, succeeded in technologically terminating the cycle of
struggles. Our travels along capital's data highways have discovered rebellions at every
point: people fighting for freedom from dependence on the wage, creating a
"communication commons," experimenting with new forms of self-organisation, and new
relations to the natural world.155 Such movements are incipient and embattled, yet
undeniable. Indeed, without in any way diminishing the magnitude of the defeats and
disarrays suffered by counter-movements over the last twenty years, I suggest that there are
now visible across the siliconised, bioengineered, post-Fordist landscape the signs of a
strange new class recomposition. This is proceeding on a much wider basis than that
traditionally conceived by Marxism. In virtual capitalism, the immediate point of
production cannot be considered the `privileged' site of struggle. Rather, the whole of
society becomes a wired workplace--but also a potential site for the interruption of
capital's integrated circuit.
There is no need to emphasise the present fragility and uncertainty of the various
reappropriations, counter-plans and alternative logics whose sinuous course we have
traced. In their isolation, each provides only a minor problem to corporate power. But in
their proliferation and interconnection they constitute a challenge to its dominion. It is
precisely the breadth and variety of such subversions that makes the fields of information
and communication so crucial today. For it is by a process of mutual discovery, recognition
and reinforcement--by an accelerating circulation of struggles--that such insurgencies could


262
attain a strength capable of prising apart the coils with which capital now encircles
society. However, an assessment of such possibilities cannot limit itself to the most
technologically-advanced sectors of development, but must rather take a perspective
embracing the truly global scope of information capital--a window that is opened in the
next chapter.

Notes
                                                
1 This concept of the circuit of capital recurs throughout Marx's work, but perhaps finds its
most systematic exposition in vol. 2 of Capital (London: Vintage, 1978) and, in a
somewhat different form, in the Introduction to Grundrisse (Harmondsworth: Penguin,
1973) 81-114.
2 The autonomist development of the concept can be found in Mario Tronti "Social
Capital," Telos 17 (1973): 105. Tronti elsewhere writes: "The more capitalist
development advances, that is to say the more the production of relative surplus value
penetrates everywhere, the more the circuit production-distribution-exchange-consumption
inevitably develops; that is to say that the relationship between capitalists production and
bourgeois society, between the factory and society, between society and the state, become
more and more organic. At the highest level of capitalist development social relations
become moments of the relations of production, and the whole society becomes an
articulation of production. In short, all of society lives as a function of the factory and the
factory extends its exclusive domination over all of society." (Tronti, Operai e Capitale,
cited & trans Cleaver, "The Inversion of Class Perspective" 137). See also Panzieri, "The
factory is becoming generalised. The factory is tending to pervade, to permeate the entire
arena of civil society ("Lotte Operaie Nello Sviluppo Capitalistico," Quaderni Piacentini
(1967), cited James O'Connor, Accumulation Crisis (Blackwell: Oxford, 1984) 151.). For
a very clear exposition of the concept iof the social factory see Harry Cleaver, "Malaria,

47 According to Andrew Kimbrell,  The Human Body Shop (Harper: San Francisco, 1993),
101, such agreements,
 . . . routinely require that the prospective mother submit to massive doses
of fertility drugs, hormone injections, amniocentesis and an array of genetic
probes and tests at the discretion of the client; require that the mother agrees
to abort the fetus on demand, and is all liable for all 'risks' associated with
conception, pregnancy and childbirth.
Payment is in the region of $10,000--$1,000 if the child is still-born.

50 As in other areas of capitalist technological development, these innovations have to be
understood not simply as means to increase productivity, but as tools to change social
relations. For example, many of the developments in biotechnology have been central to the
extension of large scale capitalist techniques to farming--agribusiness. In his classic essay,
"Technology as Political Weaponry," Science, Politics and the Agricultural Revolution in
Asia, ed. Robert Anderson (Boulder: Westview, 1981) 261-276, Harry Cleaver has
described how the 'Green Revolution' was used to break down forms of rural community
resistant to capitalist modernisation. The same process is now enacted on a multitude of
fronts: through the establishment of patent-rights over food sources cultivated in the wild
by peasant and indigenous communities; the creation of herbicide-resistant plant strains
tied to the products of particular chemical companies; the ability to bypass rural and Third
World producers by artificial synthesis of naturally occurring substances; and the
institution of methods--such as pharmological augmentation of cows by the use of bovine
growth hormone--which favour large scale enterprises. For recent developments on this
front, see Tom Athanasiou, "Greenwashing Agricultural Biotechnology," Processed

56.The implications are most immediately apparent in the US where many employers
directly carry the costs of workers health insurance, and thus have a powerful incentive not
to hire workers who can be expected to get sick. Although the peculiar atavism c of the US
health care system makes these issues surfaced very rapidly, the implications are far wider.

 62 For a collection stating the FINRAGE position see Spallone and Steinberg. FINRAGE
takes the position that such technologies are inherently dominative, and aims at an outright
ban on their development and new research agendas to discover different remedies for the
problems which the repro-tech industries complex purport to 'fix' technologically--for
example, the investigation of social and environmental causes of infertility. Other feminist
groups believe that although currently patriarchal and corporate control make these
technologies inimical to women, it may be possible to bend their trajectory in positive
directions. They therefore call not for the halting of development, but for free and non-


273
                                                                                                                                                
discriminatory access--for example, making new reproductive possibilities available to
lesbians and gays. There have also been concerns that the FINRAGE position fails to build
links with the women participants in in vitro programs, who constitute not only the
consumers but also the unwaged, experimental labour force of the repro-tech industry.
There are real contradictions, and heated controversy, between these different positions.
But both dissent strongly from the trajectory toward reproductive commodification.

81 This shift follows a path, which, as Harry Cleaver points out, Marx appears to have
foreseen. In volume1 of Capital 'nature' appears as an object outside of and opposed to
humans. But in its later volumes, Marx suggests that as capital increases the scope of its
organisation, nature is englobed by technology to a degree that that its original features
become largely unidentifiable. Harry Cleaver, Reading Capital Politically (Brighton:

lead onto broader perspectives: --"we could not but ask ourselves whether or not the
system as ordered would really promote the interests of the workers of the client company,
and if not how the design concept could be improved.".

95 The treatment of the sphere of consumption offered in this section is truncated, in that it
deals only with struggles surrounding capital's attempt to sell commodities, and not with its
activities as a purchaser of the labour power and raw materials required for "productive
consumption.". This issue is, however, later picked up, in regard to raw materials in the
section on the "The Reproduction of Nature," and in the next chapter, which discusses
capital's global cheap-labour strategy. Although Marx distinguished the extraction of
surplus value in the workplace from its realisation in the market, he also noted that the
faster capital circulates, the more often in a given period it can flow through the production
process and be augmented by the addition of surplus value. Increasing the speed with
which commodities are brought and sold can thus have the same consequence as increasing
the productivity of labour: more profits. See Marx, Grundrisse 539.

117 As Clarence Lusane, "Rap, Race, and Rebellion," Z Magazine Sep. (1992) 36,
comments, "On the one hand, rap is the voice of alienated, frustrated, and rebellious black
youth who recognise their marginality and vulnerability in post-industrial America. On the
other hand, rap is the packaging and marketing of discontent by some of the best ad
agencies and largest record poducers in the wold. It's this duality that . . . made rap and
rappers an explosive issue in the 1992 elections."

144 The Hotel and Restaurant Employees International used the Internet in its campaign to
organise a chain of luxury hotels known as the Western Lodging Group. According to
Nathan Newman, when mass firings of workers took place at the Lafayette Park Hotel, the
publicising of these news on the Internet generated hundreds of letters, calls and emails to
management. As the campaign evolved, the union targeted corporate customers of the hotel
who regularly use it to house employees or visiting clients. One of these was a software
corporation, PeopleSoft. The HREI highlighted negative facts from this company's own
financial reports and posted them to a series of computer oriented newsgroups. PeopleSoft
claims that within a week the value of their stock dropped by $63 million dollars because
of reactions by investors. Soon after, it announced it was moving customers and other
visitors to a different hotel. See Nathan Newman, "'Third Wave Unionism' Takes to the
