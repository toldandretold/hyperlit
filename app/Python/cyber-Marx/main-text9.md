Chapter 9
Intellects
General Intellect
At the beginning of this work I described class conflicts within high technology
capitalism as a "contest for general intellect." This final chapter returns to that phrase.
After describing Marx's original use of the term "general intellect," I examine the recent
reworking of his concept by a group of theorists clustered around the French journal Futur
Antérieur, and suggest how their perspective helps frame some of the issues discussed in
the preceding pages. I then conclude with some reflections on the implications of this
analysis of “general intellect” for those who teach and study in universities.
Marx introduces the concept of "general intellect" in a passage of the Grundrisse
known as the "Fragment on Machines."1 In these pages he departs from his customary
emphasis on the role of work in creating in the surpluses needed for social progress.
Rather, he suggests that at a certain point in the development of capital the creation of real
wealth will come to depend not on the direct expenditure of labour time in production, but
on two interrelated factors: technological expertise--"scientific labour"--and organisation--
"social combination."2 The crucial factor in production will become the "development of
the general powers of the human head"; "general social knowledge"; "social intellect"; or,
in a striking metaphor, "the general productive forces of the social brain."3
The main expression of the power of "general intellect" is the increasing
importance of machinery --"fixed capital"--in social organisation:


484
Nature builds no machines, no locomotives, railways, electric telegraphs,
self-acting mules etc. These are products of human industry: natural
material transformed into organs of the human will over nature, or of human
participation in nature. They are organs of the human brain, created by the
human hand: the power of knowledge, objectified. The development of
fixed capital indicates to what degree general social knowledge has
become a direct force of production, and to what degree, hence, the
conditions of the process of social life itself have come under the control of
the general intellect and been transformed in accordance with it.4
There are two forms of technology Marx particularly notes as signaling capitalism's
mobilisation of "general intellect." One is the development of production systems based on
"an automatic system of machinery . . . consisting of numerous mechanical and intellectual
organs, so that the workers themselves are cast merely as its conscious linkages."5 The
other, to which his allusions are more scattered but equally persistent, are the networks of
transport and communication integrating "the world market." The development of these
human-eliminating, globe-spanning machines indicates the degree to which "general
intellect" has been successfully mobilised and mastered by business, and "the accumulation
of knowledge and skill, of the general productive forces of the social brain . . . absorbed
into capital."6
However--and this is the whole point of Marx's analysis--such a level of
technological advance, which seems at first a capitalist utopia, contains within itself the
seeds of a capitalist nightmare. By setting in motion the powers of scientific knowledge


485
and social co-operation, capital ultimately undermines itself. This occurs for two reasons.
First, as advances in machinery and organisation reduce the requirement for direct labour
in production, the need for people to sell their labour power--the very basis of capitalism's
social order--is systematically eroded. There arises a "monstrous disproportion" between
individual labour time and the forces set in motion by organised science.
This is reinforced by a second tendency, the increasingly social nature of activity
required for technoscientific development, which unfolds not on the basis of individual
effort but as a vast co-operative endeavor. As this becomes more and more apparent,
highlighted by the diffusion and integration of communication and transport networks, both
private ownership and payment for isolated quanta of work-time appear increasingly as
irrelevant impediments to the full use of social resources. Automation and socialisation
together create the possibility of--and necessity for--dispensing with wage labour and
private ownership. In the era of general intellect "Capital thus works towards its own
dissolution as the form dominating production."7
Today, "The Fragment on Machines" seems simultaneously astoundingly prescient
and sadly anachronistic. In its extrapolation of capital's technoscientific trajectory it is
surely prophetic. What Marx describes is eminently recognisable as a portrait of what is
now commonly termed an `information society' or `knowledge economy,' in which the
entire intellectual resources of society, from shopfloor production teams, to university-
industry partnerships, to the regional `innovation milieux' of microelectronic and
biotechnology companies, is mobilised to produce the technological wonders of robotic
factories, gene splicing and global computer networks. Yet any suggestion that this
development of the productive forces leads automatically to the advent of socialism


486
appears definitively refuted. Instead, we seem to be witnessing a triumphant reorganisation
of capitalism that is deploying the new technological innovations to solidify an
unprecedented level of global domination. What --if anything--can now be made of the
revolutionary optimism of Marx's account of "general intellect"?
Futur Antérieur
It is this question that is addressed by the recent work of a group of theorists
associated with the French journal, Futur Antérieur. This group includes veterans of the
Italian autonomia movement whose earlier course was charted in Chapter 4, such as Toni
Negri and Paolo Virno, younger scholars making new departures within this tradition, such
as Michael Hardt and Maurizio Lazzarato, and others with roots in different lines of
Marxism, such as Jean-Marie Vincent.8 The central points of their analysis can be
summarised as follows.
The "mass worker" struggles of the 1960s and 1970s and the consequent crisis of
Fordism compelled capital towards extraordinary levels of high-technology automation
and global mobility. These post-Fordist experiments have now brought capital to a point
corresponding to Marx's account of "general intellect." However, rather than generating the
ordained demise of capitalism, these developments are resulting in something much more
ambiguous. Paradoxically, the revolutionary tendencies Marx identified--the erosion of
wage labour, the increasingly 'social' nature of production--are occurring, but in forms
prescribed by an order that continues to organise itself on the basis of the wage and private
ownership. As Virno remarks, these processes remind one of what Marx wrote about joint-
stock companies; that in such institutions "one witnesses the disappearance of private


487
property on the very ground of private property."9 Today post-Fordist capital displays a
similar transformation of communist potentialities into capitalist actualities. As Virno puts
it,
. . . the displacement is real, but the ground on which it is accomplished is
no less real. To think these two aspects jointly, without reducing the first to
a mere virtuality and the second to an external "rind": such is the difficulty
that cannot be avoided.10
In this situation it is not enough to focus, as Marx did, on the objectification of social
knowledge in new technologies. Rather, the critical issue is that of the nature of the human
activity required to create, support and enable this technoscientific apparatus. Here, Futur
Antérieur suggests we encounter another paradox. While capital has developed machines
to subordinate and reduce labour at the point of production, this development itself
demands the emergence a new range of social competencies and co-operations--the
cultivation of "general social knowledge." This subjective component of general intellect
Futur Antérieur group explore under the label of "mass intellectuality" ("intellectualité de
masse").
"Mass intellectuality" is the ensemble of `know-hows' which supports the operation
of the high-tech economy. It is "the social body" as a "repository of knowledges indivisible
from living subjects and from their linguistic co-operation.11" It comprises a "whole gamut
of qualifications, modes of communication, local knowledges, informal "language games"


488
and even certain ethical preoccupations"12 Negri says that "mass intellectuality" is the
activity of a "post-Fordist proletariat,"
. . . increasingly directly involved in computer-related, communicative and
formative work . . . shot through and constituted by the continuous
interweaving of technoscientific activity and the hard work of production of
commodities, by the territoriality of the networks within which this
interweaving is distributed, by the increasingly intimate combination of the
recomposition of times of labour and of forms of life.13
Mass intellect appears not just in production but throughout a whole network of educational
and cultural relations. It is present in industrial and service workers, labouring at the data-
face: in students keeping pace with technological innovation through `life-long learning';
and in the various technocultural literacies on which new markets for electronic and
entertainment goods depend. Mass intellectuality is intimately bound up with the new
prominence of what Negri and Lazzarato term "immaterial labour"-- the "distinctive quality
and mark" of work in "the epoch in which information and communication play an essential
role in each stage of the process of production."14 Overflowing and surpassing previous
Marxist distinctions between base and superstructure, economics and culture, mass
intellectuality is "difficult to describe in economic terms" but is "for that very reason (and
not despite it) the fundamental ingredient of today's capitalist production."15
The crucial question thus becomes how far capital can contain what Vincente terms
"this plural, multiform constantly mutating intelligence" of mass intellect within its


489
structures.16 As he observes, it "appears to domesticate general intellect without too much
difficulty."17 But this absorption in fact demands an extraordinary exercise of "supervision
and surveillance," involving "complex procedures of attributing rights to know and/or
rights of access to knowledge which are at the same time procedures of exclusion":
Good `management' of the processes of knowledge consists of polarising
them, of producing success and failure, of integrating legitimating
knowledges and disqualifying illegitimate knowledges, that is, ones
contrary to the reproduction of capital. It needs individuals who know what
they are doing, but only up to a certain point. Capitalist `management' and a
whole series of institutions (particularly of education) are trying to limit the
usage of knowledges produced and transmitted. In the name of profitability
and immediate results, they are prohibiting connections and relationships
that could profoundly modify the structure of the field of knowledge.18
The Futur Antérieur group suggests that these structures of exclusion and limitation can
become the occasion for new forms of social conflict.
Team Concept
Perhaps the most detailed analysis of the new antagonisms that Futur Antérieur sees
as characterising the era of “general intellect” is Negri and Lazzarato's discussion of
"participative management."19 As they point out, in many post-Fordist industries the


490
quantitative elimination of labour by computerised automation has paradoxically been
accompanied with increasing managerial concern about the quality of the remaining
workers. To prevent or fix the many breakdowns of new production systems, to run them at
peak capacity, requires operators who are creative, co-operative and alert. This
requirement has resulted in innumerable post-Taylorist experiments in work organisation "-
-'quality circles,' `team concept,' `Japanese management techniques,' `Total Quality
Management'--in which the intellectual and intersubjective aspects of labour previously
suppressed by Taylorism are mobilised for problem solving and participation. Such
systems demand that workers,
. . . become `active subjects' in the co-ordination of the different functions
of production, instead of being subjected to it as simple command. As the
new management prescribes, today it is "the soul of the worker" which must
come down into the factory.20
If new production systems are the objective side of capitalised "general intellect," the
work team represents its subjective side, in cellular form.
Such participative management schemes are, Negri and Lazzarato say, "techniques
of power."21 In an apparent contrast to Taylorism, capital grants its labour power a certain
fusion of conception and execution. Despotic management seems to retreat from the shop
floor. Capital continues, however, to dominate the overall process from the heights of the
enterprise, retaining control of finance, investment, marketing, and, of course, profit.
Problem-solving is predicated on accepting these pre-determined parameters.22 Although


491
management exhorts dialogue and interaction, communication is actually reduced to "a
simple relay of codification and decodification, within the context . . . that has been
completely normalised by the firm. 23 In this context, the exhortation to participate is, as
Lazzarato observes, authoritarian: "one must express oneself, one must speak, one must
communicate, one must co-operate."24 Indeed, the new team organisation is even more
totalitarian than the old assembly line, precisely because it seeks to involve the very
subjectivity and will of workers, making them "self control" themselves so that command
"arises from the subject itself, and from the communicative process."25
However, Negri and Lazzarato suggests there is another side to this process. In
delegating-even nominally--certain managerial responsibilities to workers, capital is
partially relinquishing its claim to act as the mediator and co-ordinator of production.
There is a potential tension between capital's control of enterprises and the increasingly
self-directed nature of work. Drawing on Negri and Lazzarato's work in the context of the
South African auto-industry, Franco Barcheisi observes,
. . . a massive contradiction arises for capital: it has to stimulate and
harness subjectivity by encouraging increasing worker responsibilisation,
even creativity, in order to grasp a social and communicational surplus
value in the workplace. This . . . comes to constitute a competitive edge in
the global fight for shrinking and specialised markets. But in doing so,
capital has to be careful in depriving worker subjectivity of any implication
in terms of power and control . . . In this way, capital silences subjectivity


492
just at the same time it calls it into life. Capital has not found, yet, the ways
to deal with this contradiction.26
Such tension becomes increasingly pronounced as business uses the knowledge squeezed
from team production to intensify automation, speed up work and increase lay-offs. In this
sense, Negri and Lazzarato suggest, post-Fordist production methods, although devised as a
means of circumventing and coopting workers organisations, contain the seeds of an
aggravated conflict.
Lazzarato has examined some of these dynamics in strikes at Peugeot car factories
in France in 1989.27 These strikes were significant because they broke a relatively long
period of industrial peace in the French automobile industry. They involved a new
generation of employees, supposedly distanced from the militancy of the older "mass"
assembly-line workers, including many immigrants, and trained for work in a highly
automated environment. Lazzarato argues that the company's rhetoric about `involvement,'
`participation,' and `dignity', although at first quite attractive to workers, gradually became
more and more mired in contradiction. There emerged an increasing discrepancy between
the company's supposed willingness to entertain all and any `suggestions' and its evident
determination to implement only those that enhanced productivity. The alleged ethic of co-
operation was riddled with actual grievances about pay and pace of work. This led to
mounting tension on the shop floor, which eventually exploded. In the strikes, one of the
workers' demands was for the company to live up to its own rhetoric about respect and co-
operation. Moreover, in this strike, Lazzarato argues, new forms of shop floor and
community organisation could be seen emerging, in some ways supplanting the more


493
conventional and rigid forms of trades union hierarchy. This, he suggests, shows that the
co-operative' aspects of the new work organisation were being mobilised, but in the form
of counter-power. Moreover, these isolated strikes can now been seen as anticipations of
the society wide explosions of the 1995/1996 general strike in France, with its remarkable
spontaneous organisation by myriad popular assembles.
Although North America has not seen concerted unrest on the scale of the French
strikes, Futur Antérieur's claim that forms of "participative management" are generating
new flash-points for industrial conflict receives some confirmation if we examine
workplace tendencies in the US and Canada. A survey of 1500 workers and managers on
the topic of team organisation, conducted by the US consultant firm Kepner-Tregoe
produced findings so shocking that the researchers had them checked by another company.
The verified results clearly showed that every aspect of participative management elicited
disenchanted cynicism amongst workers. In the words of Kepner-Tregoe's President:
The vitriolic response was amazing . . . Workers don't like their companies,
and there is a fundamental social change going on in this country regarding
workplace relations. The workers hear the verbiage about how `our people
are the most important asset we have' and they want to throw up.28
In at least one sector where capital’s drive for team work and other new
management techniques has been very intense, the automobile industry, the mid-1990s have
seen a series of significant strikes. Tactically, car workers discovered the susceptibility of
highly integrated, technologically sophisticated `just-in-time' production to strategic work


494
stoppages. Strategically, they made demands that responded aggressively to new
technological conditions by challenging on traditional managerial prerogatives. In Flint,
Michigan, car workers struck to compel hiring new workers rather than increasing
overtime, linked these demands to the need to reduce unemployment, and won partial
successes. 29 In 1996 Canadian autoworkers responded to contracting-out by General
Motors by striking in support of `job ownership'--shorter work time, restrictions and
outsourcing, and guaranteed job levels for the communities in which plants were located.30
The strike, which lasted twenty one days, and included the workers’ occupation of a plant
from which GM was attempting to remove dies to start production elsewhere, won
considerable public support and was victorious. In both these cases, workers fought for
real, not token, voice in production decisions, and linked workplace demands to a social
agenda aimed at counteracting the destructive consequences of capitalism’s post-Fordist
restructuring.
As we saw in Chapter 5, some North American factory workers, faced with drastic
downsizing have gone so far as to introduce alternative production proposals. Autoworkers
in Ontario and Los Angeles have entered into alliances with environmental and community
groups to introduce `green work’ plans, and have even began to connect up these projects
internationally. In other sectors, especially in the manufacturing and defence industries,
there have been instances where workers faced with automation and relocation have
challenged capital's right to shut down. 31 Plant closures have been met with plant
occupations and picket lines aimed not only at stopping strike-breakers getting in but at
preventing machines being taken out. Facing the withdrawal of waged work, labour has
deployed its invention power not so much to stop production (as in classic strike


495
strategies), but to keep it going—and, sometimes, to transform it, converting military or
ecologically damaging industries towards “socially useful production.”32 Sometimes
symbolic, sometimes sustained, such actions have occasionally either forced capital to
continue operations contrary to its intentions or transferred management entirely into the
hands of the workers. Repeatedly they have involved the creation of alliances with wider
community groups negatively affected by capital flight. Initially defensive and local,
usually limited in their aims, most of such efforts are painlessly reabsorbed within the
overall logic of market relations. Nevertheless, in their proliferation, they constitute a
multiplicity of subversive question marks about the priorities of capitalist production.
Alongside these projects for what be might called “autonomous production” are a
whole series of struggles over the allocation of time.33 The objectives workers seek are
diverse: resistance to lay-offs, roll-backs, speed-ups and contracting out; demands for
redundancy compensation; support for retraining; better pay and conditions for contingent
workers; protection of health and other benefits. These goals are not, per se, new. But they
are set in a new context--that of the vast potential surpluses of labour time produced by
automation. Underlying the new wave of struggles is a rejection of capital's prerogative to
plan and manage these surpluses to its own advantage. Most importantly, there are, as
discussed in Chapter 8, a number of initiatives to address the crisis of employment by
shortening the working day, and introducing new, general forms of income distribution
separate from the wage. These movements often emerge at the intersections of labour,
feminist, green and poor people’s movements. Currently tentative and in a state of flux,
their potential, in terms of weakening the wage relation, reorganising household labour and


496
stopping the environmental destruction resulting from capital’s drive for “production for
productions sake,” is very wide.
 In such movements social labour has mobilised the same intellectual and co-operative
capacities that capital tries to harness through teamwork, but in different directions, and
with a vastly expanded horizon of collective responsibility. These movements establish
networks of counter-research and pools of shared experience, new connections and
alliances; they build a capacity for counter-planning from below. In short, they represent a
nascent alternative to capitalism’s organisation of “general intellect.”
Interactive Networks
The other field where Futur Antérieur has investigated the contradictions of "general
intellect" is that of media and communication. As Vincente puts it, "general intellect" is in
fact “a labour of networks and communicative discourse";
In effect, it is not possible to have a "general intellect" without a great
variety of polymorphous communications, sequences of communication in
the teams and collectivities work, communications to use in a creative
fashion the knowledges already accumulated, communications to elaborate
and record new knowledges.34
Capital has developed technologies of information--mass media, telecommunications, and
computer networks--to consolidate markets and ideological control. But here too it has


497
been unable to develop the objective, fixed, machine side of "general intellect" without
also involving the subjective, variable, human aspect. Negri specifically rejects media
critiques framed only in terms of "manipulation."35 Although we now inhabit a world
where corporate media seem to constitute a vast "machine" which dominates society, there
are, he says, spaces on the “inside” of this machine within which new individual and
collective subjectivities can emerge.36
The Futur Antérieur authors have studied a number of movements in France where groups
opposing neoliberal policies have shown great dexterity in using media and information
technologies to publicise their cause. These include strikes by cultural workers--film-
crews and audio-visual technicians--fighting for improvements in the conditions of
contingent work; the movements of nurses opposing cut-backs and privatisation of health
care; and the student revolts of 1986, which were discussed in Chapter 4.37 In Italy,
Lazzarato has analyzed the media practices of the "Panther" student movement, which in the
late 1990s closed some one hundred and fifty Italian colleges and universities in protests
against privatisation.38These movements, Lazzarato says, were characterised by their
extreme sophistication in counter-management of the media. The students exercised careful
control of how, and under what conditions, journalists covered their actions. They refused
to subscribe to conventions damaging to the political integrity of the movement (e.g. focus
on leaders). And they made constant use of information technologies--particularly fax--to
generate their own coverage and bulletins. Lazzarato argues that the Panthers’ careful
orchestration of refusals and reappropriations display the generational characteristics of
subjects who, having come-of-age in a media environment, are capable of shaping this


498
terrain for their own political purposes, rather than merely being passively exploited as
objects of spectacular display.
These tendencies are, again, manifest in a North America context, where alternative
and subversive media channels--political film and video networks, community TV,
microwatt and community radio--have spread like fireweed. Even as corporate media
consolidate more massive vertically integrated empires, “mass intellect” seems engaged in
a proliferating counter-usage of information technology, springing hundreds of leaks and
counter-flows within capital’s communication apparatus. Such grassroots media
experiments are not only plaguing capital with an epidemic of transgressions against
“intellectual property,” but are playing a crucial role in circulating news and analysis of
struggle across sectorially diverse and geographically distant movements.
Nowhere has this been more apparent than in the field of computer-mediated
communications. As we have seen, in the development of this extraordinarily powerful
technology capital has in fact depended on a mass of informal, innovatory, intellectual
activity--'hacking'--on whose creativity commerce constantly draws even as it criminalises
it. It was precisely out of capital's inability to contain such activity that there emerged the
astounding growth of the Internet. This is surely the quintessential institution of "general
intellect." For, despite all the admitted banalities and exclusivities of Internet practice, one
at moments glimpses in its global exchanges what seems like the formation of a
polycentric, communicatively-connected, collective intelligence.39
 Today, of course capital is trying to recuperate this collective intelligence by
channeling it along the information highway, forcing its traffic into the commodified
pathways of video-on-demand, teleshopping, tele-gambling, and personalised advertising.


499
It is funneling network interactions into a commercial "interactivity." As Chris Carlsonn
observes, there is an interesting parallel between such media interactivity and participative
management techniques.40 For the control which corporate interactivity offers media
audiences,
. . mimics the false control offered by workers participation schemes,
wherein workers decide how to accomplish the businesses mission, but,
crucially, not what the mission is.41
If the work-team is the microcosmic, cellular, shopfloor form of capitalism’s “general
intellect,” the media interactivity of the corporate information highway is its macrocosmic
mode, expanding through the entire social metabolism in an attempt integrate subjects into a
seamless circuit of labour and consumption.
On the Internet, however, mass intellect has spectacularly refused to be corralled.
In earlier chapters, I have already given several instances of the dissident cyber-
communication that has become a significant part of oppositional politics in the 1990s. To
these examples I can do no better than add one more instance, originally reported by the
conservative Canadian newspaper The Globe and Mail, but, appropriately enough, emailed
to me by a telecommunications worker who tirelessly relays anti-capitalist news to an
array of electronic contacts. The report, dated May 1998, concerns the stalling of the
Multilateral Agreement on Investment (MAI).
The MAI was intended as the latest in the round of international agreements
assuring the untrammeled activity of the world market, in this case by effectively removing


500
governments ability to regulate corporate direct investment. Officials of the OECD pursued
preliminary discussions in high secrecy for eighteen months, apparently pursuing a stealth
strategy designed to circumvent opposition. In 1997, however, activists from the
Malaysian-based Third World Network alerted international social movements to these
proceedings. The Council for Canadians, a movement fighting the destruction of the
Canadian welfare state, obtained a draft of the treaty and, as The Globe and Mail puts it,
“immediately posted it on Web site and made sure allies around the world knew it was
there through e-mail.“ 42As news of the planned agreement leaked, it was met by a wave of
protest:
High-powered politicians had reams of statistics and analysis on why a set
of international investing rules would make the world a better place. They
were no match, however, for a global band of grassroots organisers, which,
with little more than computers and access to the Internet, helped derail a
deal. . . .Using the Internet’s capability to broadcast information instantly
worldwide (these) groups . . . have been able to keep each other informed
of the latest developments and supply information gleaned in one country
that may prove embarrassing to a government in another. By pooling their
information they have broken through the wall of secrecy that traditionally
surrounds international negotiations, forcing governments to deal with their
complaints. “We are in constant contact with our allies in other countries,”
said Maude Barlow, in the Council of Canadian’s chairwoman. “If a


501
negotiator says something to someone over a glass of wine, we’ll have it on
the Internet within an hour, all over the world.”43
The Globe and Mail goes on to remark that “the OECD’s efforts to harness the
Internet have not caught up in colour, content and consumer friendliness to those of the
advocacy groups” and reports an official’s rueful comment that it had failed on a “strategy
on information, communication and explication.“ The extent of the failure was clear when
disagreements amongst the negotiators, disagreements at least in partly reflecting the
pressures bought to bear on their domestic governments by popular movements, resulted in
a failing to meet their initial deadline for negotiating the MAI. “This is the first successful
Internet campaign by non-governmental organisations,” said one diplomat. “It’s been very
effective.”44
It would be foolish to exaggerate the significance of what may prove only a
temporary and tactical victory. Nor should The Globe and Mail’s account of “How the Net
Killed the MAI” be uncritically accepted, for it overlooks the amount of very traditional,
on-the-ground in person meetings, marches, demonstrations and pickets, involved in the
anti-MAI mobilisation. However, if its analysis is even partially true--and my own
experiences of the campaign suggests that it is--then this is a striking vindication of
Negro’s thesis about the capacities of mass intellect to reclaim advanced capital’s means
of communication. Moreover, this example suggests that social movements are beginning to
consider using this capacity in more than a reactive way. Spokespeople for the Council of
Canadians are cited as suggesting that the next stage of the anti-MAI campaign will activate
the global communications network to circulate plans for alternatives to capitalism’s


502
globalising project. They stress that while anti-MAI groups are “against this model of
economic globalisation” their use of the Internet shows their own commitment to the “idea
of coming together and working together” across international boundaries.45 Such global,
electronically facilitated counter-planning is precisely what might be expected of a
movement of “mass intellect.”
How General is “General Intellect”?
Looking at the contradictions appearing both in the workplace and in the larger
societal networks of the post-Fordist economy, the Futur Antérieur group argues that mass
intellect  is in fact potentially explosive for capital. This volatility arises not only from a
dynamic of immiseration--with more and more people being expelled from production by
automation--but also from a reappropriative process in which "mass intellect" begins to
fold back into itself the organisational and technological knowledges necessary for the
running of society. Negri now calls this capacity "constituent power," and describes the
task of radical politics as the creation of a "republic" that dissolves both capitalist
command and state authority.46 Virno speaks of an "exodus" from the "society of work"
made possible by a radical re-disposal of the surplus time arising from automation.47 It is
these potentialities of "mass intellect" which Futur Antérieur now sees pulsing through a
wave of social protest in advanced capitalist societies of the 1990s--in France, but also in
the large scale strikes and protests in Italy, Germany and Belgium, and to a lesser degree in
the North America.
The argument that subversive potentialities exist at the very heart of the
technological armature that seems to make contemporary capital so impregnable is an


503
attractive one. Although only starting to be translated and discussed in North America,
Futur Antérieur's revival and reworking of the category of "general intellect" has already
sparked some debate in Europe. This has, however, included some substantial criticisms.48
Perhaps the most serious of these objections is that, in its capitalist form, "general
intellect" is not "general" at all, but rather structured by an intensely hierarchical division
of labour. This restricts crucial knowledges to a narrow stratum of privileged, and hence
loyal, employers, leaving the rest to suffer the effects of technological deskilling. The
edifice of scientific-technological power depends not just on scientists, engineers,
programmers and various "symbolic analysts" but on a mass of janitors, homeworkers,
fast-food cooks and other service workers. But the crucial point, the critics say, is that
these latter are excluded from the intellectual functions of the capitalist economy. The
whole capitalist organisation of work is in fact, predicated on dividing the `head' of the
collective worker from the `arms,' `feet,' `digestive,' `excretory,' and `reproductive' organs.
Given this, the capacities Futur Antérieur focuses on would seem to be very unevenly
distributed.
Associated with this criticism is a suspicion about some of Futur Antérieur's
terminology--particularly its references to "immaterial labour." For this can easily be read
as obscuring the continued importance of a vast mass of all-too physical and material work
in the post-Fordist economy--domestically, in the service sector, and internationally, in
everything from labour on coffee plantations to the trade in body organs. To speak of
"immaterial labour" can also easily occlude some very corporeal components of high-tech
work, such as the epidemic of repetitive strain injuries associated with computer use.


504
These problems are clearly related to the relatively cursory analysis of the
gendered or international dimensions of "general intellect" offered by Futur Antérieur--
omissions that might be pointedly related to the fact that most of its authors are men,
located in Europe or North America. The new circuits of capital, it could be argued, look a
lot less "immaterial" and "intellectual" to the female and Southern workers who do so
much of the grueling physical toil demanded by a capitalist "general intellect" whose
headquarters remain preponderantly male and Northern. Indeed, the Futur Antérieur
analysis has been accused of an all-too-familiar sort of Marxist vanguardism, whose
protagonist is now not the `industrial' but the `intellectual' proletariat--a vanguardism
which is, however, made peculiarly implausible by the relatively privileged conditions
which its chosen protagonist enjoys.
Futur Antérieur authors have replied to these objections. Hardt and Negri go to
some pains to designate "mass intellectuality" as a general propensity of the post-Fordist
proletariat, and not as some "recomposed vanguard or leading sector." 49 Technoscientific
labour, they say, is a "massified quality of labouring intelligentsia, of cyborgs and
hackers."50 It is " a quality of subjectivity that extends through the various sectors of
production."51 Discussing the category of "immaterial" work, Hardt and Negri underline
that "however immaterial this labor might be it still involves both brains and bodies."52
"Mass intellectuality" has to be understood as including the affective, emotional work
performed inside and outside the home by women--for example, the labour of nurses which
is both "both highly technical and affective."53 Moreover, the Futur Antérieur focus on
advanced, post-Fordist production methods is not, they say, meant to deny the existence of
other Fordist or even more archaic techniques, particularly in the South. Rather, it only


505
suggests that high-technology practices furnish the command, control and communication
capacity through which the whole system operates, and that these practices, in both obvious
and subtle ways, bathe the whole arena of struggle in their influence.
As Ed Emery has recently suggested, resolution of the debate about “general
intellect” really calls for a project on the lines of what Marx called "a workers' inquiry,"
involving a network of researchers engaged in participatory study of emergent forms of
struggle.54
In the meantime, my own view is that while the Futur Antérieur analysis has to be very
seriously qualified, it is also `onto' something important. Although the initial propositions
of Negri, Lazzarato and Hardt need extensive revision to take fuller account of capital's
tendency to polarise the allocation of skills and competencies along lines of gender and
race, such a reworking need not invalidate the concept of "mass intellect."
As we saw in Chapter 5, while capital has found in computers and other forms of
informatics the weapons to assault the old factory-centered fortifications of working class,
this attack is rebounding in unpredicted ways. The creation and operation of such
technologies depends on widespread scientific and organisational competencies. Indeed, it
presumes the very development of so-called human capital which neoliberalism is now
eroding through its erosion of the educational, medical and communicational infrastructures
of the welfare state. The paradoxical result is that a technologically-armed corporate order
finds itself confronting the trades unionist with an autonomous production plan and a
computer network of international contacts; the anti-poverty activist with a micro-watt
transmitter and an alternative budget; the reproductive rights worker trained in medical
science, scanning the data-banks for genetic patents; the anti-Aids organiser with


506
camcorder and pharmaceutical expertise; the rioter connected to the Internet--in short, by a
force of social labour which will not acquiesce to technological revolution commanded
from above, but rather demands the right to direct this epochal transformation from below.
Moreover, although capital clearly attempts to limit and divide access to the social
knowledges vital to technoscientific power, it should not be assumed that this division and
fragmentation always succeeds. Indeed, the globalisation process described in Chapter 6 is
in large part unfolding as a story of capital’s failure to maintain such segregation. In an era
when Silicon Valley janitors can access email to embarrass the computer companies they
are striking against, and the World Wide Web carries the messages of Zapatistas and East
Timorese resistance fighters, it is clear that the wretched of the earth are neither entirely
outside the mechanisms high-technology production, or (more importantly) completely
powerless to reappropriate them.55 The question of whether capital will successfully
segment post-Fordist labour power, or if, on the contrary, rebellious subjects will break
down these barriers to establish new alliances, lies at the core of what I call "the contest
for general intellect." In this contest the contemporary proletariat fights to actualise
"general intellect," not according to the privatising, appropriative logic of capital, but in
ways that are deeply democratic and collective, and hence truly "general."
Virtual Universities
This account of the cycles and circuits of struggle in high-technology capitalism
was written in an academic context. It is therefore only appropriate to end by considering
what the analysis of “general intellect” might mean for those specifically and particularly
intellectual labourers who teach and study at universities.56 For no site could be more vital


507
to capital’s harnessing of collective intelligence than academia. Over the last twenty-five
years, it has been reshaped by an inexorable dialectic. Capitalist industry, mutating into its
informational phase, has become more intellectual; Microsoft calls its central production
facilities a `campus.' Simultaneously, universities have become more industrial, acting as
ancillary research and training facilities for capital's overall project of high-technology
development: Academia, Inc.
This advancement of “corporate-university partnership” has as its aim what David
Noble, North America’s most trenchant critic of this union, terms “the systematic
conversion of intellectual activity into intellectual capital, and, hence, intellectual
property.”57 As Noble points out, this process has passed through a series of phases. In the
first stage, unfolding through the 1970s and 1980s, the research activities of the university
were effectively commercialised. This was accomplished partly through the fostering of
industry sponsored or targeted programs at the expense of basic research; partly through the
installation of research parks and other entrepreneurial experiments on campus sites; and
partly by legal changes that give post-secondary institutions an interest in merchandising
patents resulting from faculty research. The second stage in the university-corporate
merger, however, has only appeared during the 1990s, with the drive towards the `virtual
university,' based on large-scale, computer-assisted, tele-learning--a development which,
Noble says, has as its aim nothing less than the commodification of the university’s
teaching function.
 
Virtual university experiments, now widespread in both the US and Canada, are
promoted under the banner of accessibility, innovation and inevitable technological
progress. But, Noble argues, they are really concerned with “transforming courses into


508
courseware, (and) the activity of instruction itself into commercially viable proprietary
products that can be owned and bought and sold in the market.”58 At the core of this
process is a classic industrial strategy of deskilling and automation, downloading
instructor’s courses into reusable software packages over whose use they surrender all
pedagogical control. Experiments in this direction typically involve the universities in
complex partnerships with computer corporations, carrier companies and edutainment
providers. These commercial interests look to the virtual university as a market for
hardware and software products, and educational software as a saleable on-line
commodity. For university administrators, virtual universities offer a dramatic way of
cutting labour costs and centralising managerial control. This is accomplished either by the
simple elimination of the faculty whose knowledge has been extracted in digital form, or,
in the case of the remaining live instructors, through an envelopment in multiple on-line
teaching requirements, complete with endless email solicitations, Web site preparations,
and monitored electronic activities. Although there is an almost complete lack of
substantial evidence as to the pedagogical benefits of computerised education, this does not
deter the rush to convert universities into what Noble scathingly terms “digital diploma
mills.”59
Those who have followed the cycle of capitalist restructuring and class
recomposition outlined in this book will not be surprised to hear that the “virtualising” of
universities has already provoked resistance. At both the University of California Los
Angeles, and at the University of British Columbia, students have opposed the additional
fees that universities impose to implement such high-tech schemes. And at Canadian
universities, such as York and Arcadia, faculty have struck to maintain control over


509
teaching methods in the face of mounting administrative attempts to technologically control
their work.60
These resistances should be supported and extended. But it is also important to ask
whether there are any aspects of the “virtual university” agenda, and the larger process of
academic-corporate fusion of which it is part, which offer not just threats, but
opportunities. Writing in a European context, Negri and Lazzarato suggest that this might be
the case. In the era of the `ivory-tower,' they say, when universities were only partially
integrated into capitalism, or marginal to its central functions, academics appeared
(however much this actually mystified real interconnections) to be removed from industrial
activity and its attendant class-conflicts. It was from this position of apparent exteriority
that the intellectual could commit or engage himself with political movements. From the
end of the Second World War, however, this distance began to rapidly diminish. Today,
when the distance separating the university from business has sunk to virtually zero,
university teachers find themselves unequivocally involved in capital’s appropriation of
“general intellect.”
These changed conditions, Negri and Lazzarato suggest, creates the grounds for a
new relation between dissenting academics and oppositional social movements. Rather
than descending from the heights of the university to commit themselves to a cause largely
external to their daily experience, possibilities emerge for academics to make more
"transverse" connections.61 Academics perhaps lose some pretensions as the bearer of
great truths and grand analysis, but become the carriers of particular skills, knowledges
and accesses useful to movements in which they participate on the basis of increasing
commonalties with other members of post-Fordist “mass intellect.”62


510
I would add that the matrix for these connections are the new movements of social
unrest. Participation in these movements pull academics and students into contact with
other public service workers protesting cutbacks, wider labour and trades unionist
organisations, and the many diverse constituencies surging against capital’s agenda of high-
technology austerity. Out of such contacts comes a corporate-university interaction very
different from that which capital intends—one which disseminates opposition to corporate
rule from the streets back onto the campuses, and again from the campuses out onto the
streets.
The possibility of such a counterflow exists because, to effectively harness mass
intellect to accumulation, capital must maintain a certain degree of openness within the
universities. Part of what business seeks in its invasion of academia is the creativity and
experimentation of social labour-power, qualities vital to a high-technology economy
based on perpetual innovation. But if industry is to benefit from such invention-power, it
cannot entirely regiment the institutions of education. However carefully it circumscribes
the budgets and mission-statements of academia, capital’s incessant search for competitive
advantage requires chances for unforeseen synthesis, opportunities for the unpredicted but
really profitable idea or invention to emerge. And this unavoidable condition of an
economic order based on general intellect gives a limited but real porosity to universities.
This porosity can be exploited by dissident academics--to research and teach on topics of
value to social movements in opposition to capital; to invite activists and analysts from
these movements onto campuses and into lectures and seminars; and to use the university's
resources, including its easy access to the great communication networks of our age, to
circulate news and analysis that are otherwise marginalised.


511
The administrative imposition of computers and other high-technology on the
classroom should sometimes simply be opposed as pedagogically destructive. But in other
cases--and sometimes simultaneously-- it is possible to recapture the virtual apparatus for
alternative purposes. It should be remembered that students and academics played a major
part in the unauthorised creation of the Internet that took the nascent technology of
computer-mediated communication beyond the unilateral control of the military-industrial
complex, and opened it to a popular use that blindsided corporate planning. Subsequently,
students have continued to use the networks for subversive purposes. To give just one
example, in spring of 1994 Latino and Chicano students at the Universities of Michigan,
Colorado, Nebraska and numerous sites in California erupted in hunger strikes and
occupations. They demanded new programs, anti-racist initiatives, grape boycotts in
support of farmworkers, and the naming of buildings in memory of Caesar Chavez. Their
protests were extensively connected and co-ordinated by computer-communications
facilitated by sympathetic librarians, faculty and union organisers.63 Similarly, 1995 and
1996 saw the email-co-ordination of multi-campus protests against reductions in student
aid and rising tuition fees both in Canada and the US.64
More broadly, it is clear that much of the of the circulation of oppositional content
on the Internet today is conducted from academic centres by students and teachers, acting as
relays to wider constituencies. Noble would be the first to appreciate the irony that his
denunciations of “digital diploma mills” have been primarily distributed through by way of
email and electronic publications. In the era of mass intellect, a purely Luddite stance is
not enough. To grasp the tactical and strategic chances presented by capital’s failure to


512
control the technological dynamics it has set in motion, activists must be, as Dorothy Kidd
and I once put it, “Luddites on Mondays and Fridays, cyberpunks the rest of the week.”65
Conclusion
In academia, as elsewhere, labour power is never completely controllable. To the
degree that capital uses the university to harness general intellect, insisting its workforce
engage in life-long learning as the price of employability, it runs the risk that people will
teach and learn something other than what it intends. In my own practice, a crucial aspect
of teaching that “something other” is to address critically the utopian promises of
information revolution examined at the beginning of this book.
It is both very important, and relatively easy, to demonstrate how hollow these
promises have proven over the last three decades: how they have brought the majority of
people in Europe and North America not new technologically-generated wealth, but
declining or stagnant real wages; how the mirage of increased, enriched leisure has
evaporated into rates of unemployment and poverty unimaginable twenty years ago; how
the `knowledge class' that was to humanise capital has found itself pink-slipped by its
corporate masters, sharing the welfare line with millions of others; how the high-skill,
high-tech service jobs are fractional compared to the burgeoning mass of poorly paid and
precarious `McJobs'; how the `co-operative' workplace is terrorised by downsizing,
closures and concessionary roll-backs; how the heralded multiplication of media channels
masks an intensifying concentration of ownership; how promises of `all information
everywhere' translates into a vast extension of property rights and corporate power. From
this point of view, the utopian announced by information revolutionaries is mere fraud.


513
However, to teach this, unalloyed, can simply reinforce despair and cynicism.
Demystification, practiced alone, leads to a dead end--to the assertion of monolithic and
unbreakable capitalist power that characterises so much of what passes for Marxism today.
The more difficult task is to identify the possibilities of things being other than they are. As
Raymond Williams wrote, the crucial challenge is "making hope practical, rather than
despair convincing."66
For this purpose, I have found the analysis offered by of autonomist Marxism, with
its emphasis on the constantly changing and renewed cycle of struggles between capital and
labour, particularly valuablel. This perspective shows how the information revolution
came into being as a result of a social contest, as part of a vast restructuring by capital
intended to evade and suppress working class opposition. More importantly, it suggests
that this informational restructuring has failed. Rather than pacifying class conflict,
digitalisation and genetic engineering only displace capital’s constant internal war--so that
the lines of contestation now run along the inside of the very technological systems
deployed to overcome them.
To contain crisis, capital has been compelled to set in play agents and subjects
whose capacities outrun its control. Now, more than ever before, it has "conjured up such
gigantic means of production and of exchange" that it becomes like "a sorcerer, who is no
longer able to control the powers of the nether world which he has called up by his
spells."67 If workers' refusal of work has resulted in extraordinary levels of automation, the
new machine-systems now threaten the viability of the wage economy itself. If local
militancies have provoked capital to seek global mobility, the very communication and
transportation networks down which it flees provide the threads of new, transnational


514
solidarities. If people's desires for education and self-development have been made the
stuff of a knowledge-for-profit market, collective intelligence turns to criticise the human
and environmental costs of this trajectory--and to devise alternatives.
At its present very high level of technoscientific development, corporate power
finds itself dependent on levels of co-operative activity, unimpeded communication, and
free circulation of knowledge that, far from being easily integrated into its hierarchies,
exist in persistent tension with its command. Thus the possibilities that information
revolutionaries speak of cannot just be written off as false promises. Rather, they are a
refracted and distorted version of real potentialities for a new social order, liberated from
the despotic constraints of constant work, denied wealth and destructive accumulation.
 
However, the actualisation of these hopes demands breaking-through the limits
capital currently imposes on human development. I have argued that there are now visible
signs of an emergent collectivity refusing the logic of commodification, uprising at the very
moment that the world market seems to have swallowed the entire planet. Deepening and
expanding this process of recomposition depends on interconnection between many and
disparate movements at different points along capitalism’s circuits. Ironically, the
conversations necessary for creation of the new combination are now being conducted
across the world-spanning communication networks that information-age capital has itself
created. It is as a contribution to that circulation of struggles that this book is offered.

The Labor Process and Control of Labor: The Changing Nature of Work Relations in the
Late Twentieth Century, Berch.Berberoglu (Westport: Praeger, 1993) .In the steel plants he
examines workers are required to communicate, interact and participate, but only within
certain predetermined parameters is embodied in the various forms of "premise" or
"alogorithmic.control" associated with informatic production systems. In "premise
control," top management calculates cost-efficient ways to conduct each step in the
operation: these are then transmitted as rules through the computer system. Parameters
within which choices can be made are already embedded in the programs directing
production Responsibility thus take the form of adjustments within a pre-set process, rather
than control over it. Command resides at the level of the total system, so that the autonomy


517
                                                                                                                                                
bestowed on the parts is strictly limited. As Prechel puts it in his study of the post-Fordist
US steel industry, management can thus "centralise command, while decentralising
responsibility for the decision," pushing responsibility down the organisational hierarchy,
while maintaining control at the top. It is this sort of "premise ontrol" which allows some
companies to devolve responsibilities from middle level and line-management to the shop
floor, while still maintaining ultimate authority firmly within the control of upper level
management. This creates a paradoxical position where, while the worker may indeed by
'skilled' this skill is divorced from any individual or group 'control' over the production
process. On this point see also Steven Vallas, Power in the Workplace: The Politics of
Production at AT & T (New York: State University of New York, 1993).
