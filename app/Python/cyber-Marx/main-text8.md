Chapter 8
Alternatives
The Great Leviathan
Describing alternatives to capitalism has always troubled Marxists. Marx's early
writings contain lyrical evocations of post-capitalist possibilities. But he and Engels were
highly critical of "utopian socialisms"--many of them technocratic ancestors of today's
information society theory--that drew-up elaborate pictures of ideal societies without
recognising the need for struggle and conflict to attain them.1 Rejecting these "Comtist
cookbooks about the future," they held that communism is "not a state of affairs which is to
be established, an ideal to which reality [will] have to adjust itself" but rather "the real
movement which abolishes the present state of things."2
Today, however, mere invocation of the "real movement " is not immediately
encouraging. A vast block of despair and cynicism consolidates the dominance of the
world market. The catastrophe of state socialism has left millions convinced that, however
appalling the trajectory of capitalism may be, there is simply no alternative to it. This
resignation is then reinforced by information capital's managers--those whom Pierre
Bourdieu recently called the "kings of technocracy-- in whose discourse any attempt to
think beyond the `realities' of global competition and automating technology is instantly
dismissed as tantamount to delirium.3 As Massimo De Angelis observes, such "technicism"
serves as the "ultimate legitimisation" for capitalism, making its economic order into “a
great Leviathan, the unchangeable and unquestionable constraint facing all political and
cultural subjectivity, a constraint that subsumes everything.”4


424
De Angelis argues that in the face of this conceptual closure there is an urgent need
"recover a utopian discourse, in thought as well as in antagonistic and constitutive
practice."5 He observes that, “Through an interesting play on words, the word utopia is
defined in English as nowhere - no place. But this could also be read as now here - here
and now.”6 De Angelis goes on to distinguish between "realisable" futures, that
"presuppose a pre-conceived plan which must be realised (by subordinating to the plan all
the people who don't like it)," and "actualisable" futures, where "whatever is actualisable
is already existing in a virtual way, where virtuality is a dimension of reality."7 He urges
utopian invention, "not as the alternative model, not as a party program or a plan in search
of subjects to subordinate" but as "an open and inclusive horizon of thought, antagonistic
practice and communication" that can "show different possible horizons and contrast them
to the poverty of the mainstream one."8
It is in the spirit of De Angelis’ proposal that I offer a sketch of an alternative
future. I propose a series of measures--the institution of a guaranteed annual income, the
creation of universal communications networks, the use of these networks in decentralised,
participatory counter-planning, and the democratic control of decisions about
technoscientific development. These elements would, in their full implementation and
synergistic interaction, go a long way towards constituting a viable alternative to
capitalism. Moreover, each of the separate elements proposed here, and each of the
various gradients and steps in their realisation, can be seen as delineating fronts of
struggle. They are conceived of as invading beachheads that can be established on the
shoreline of capital and advanced, up to the point where their combined effect overwhelms


425
the logic of the entire system. The final section of the chapter briefly reflects on some
conditions under which this might occur.
The ideas proposed here have not fallen from the sky. They extrapolate not only
from a variety of theoretical sources but also from what is really being done, now, in what
autonomists would term the "self-valorising" practices of a multitude of activists.9 The
interweaving of elements and possibilities that are now in fact commanding wide attention
can constitute what might be considered a utopian future.10
This thought-experiment does, however, have some important limitations. It focuses
only on those issues that relate to this book’s major theme--the social uses of the new
information technologies. Its basic orientation comes from Marx's observation in
Grundrisse, that while machinery may be the "most appropriate form" of capital, capital is
not necessarily the most appropriate social form for machines.11 To illustrate this point, I
assume a society in which high-technologies are fairly readily available. Since currently
these conditions obtain most strongly in a handful of advanced capitalist economies, the
sketch is Eurocentric. There is a missing dimension, whose importance I acknowledge but
do not address, one that involves issues such as the release of the South from an
exterminatory debt burden, the reversal of the flows of value from South to North, the
payment by the North for the preservation of the ecological resource vital to planetary
survival, and the support of spaces for what is sometimes termed "autonomous
development" freed from the economic and cultural constraints of neo-colonialism.12
I think of this sketch as a proposal for `communism’--a continuation of the red
thread which Marx and so many others have spun across centuries. But I also know that this
name, `communism,’ has become so heavy, so sodden with blood and weighted with


426
nightmarish history, and carries with it such a burden of explanation, repudiation and
qualification, that many regard it as unspeakable, at least for this generation and probably
several more.13 What word might be used instead? I do not want to talk of `socialism,' a
concept profoundly tainted--in its authoritarian forms, by terror; and in its social
democratic variants, by failed compromise.14 I might follow the lead of Cornelius
Castioradis, who now speaks of an "autonomous society"--but this phrase also is freighted
with its author's changing allegiances, and too rhetorically ponderous to be attractive.15
Therefore, sometimes use another term: commonwealth. Some of the connotations
of this word, too, are unappealing. But others are very appropriate. It designates quite
exactly what I have in mind-a common-wealth of collectively shared resources. It derives
from a root around which clusters other concepts important to this study --like communism,
communication, and commons. Common-wealth also recalls the energy of 17th-century
revolutionary republicanism: if this proposal seems like a 21st century version of the
visions of Diggers and Ranters seeking a "world turned upside down," so be it.16
Zerowork: Guaranteed Income
Marx wrote that:
. . . the realm of freedom actually begins only where labour which is
determined by necessity and mundane considerations ceases: thus in the
very nature of things it lies beyond the sphere of actual material production
. . . Beyond it begins that development of human energy which is an end in
itself, the true realm of freedom, which, however, can blossom forth only


427
with this realm of necessity as its basis. The shortening of the working day
is its basic prerequisite.17
This is the prospect that the' information revolution' seems to bring in sight.
Since the dawn of such computerised automation, people have been concerned about the
consequences for employment. As early as 1949, Norbert Weiner, the father of cybernetics,
raised the spectre of a crisis of work resulting from robotisation.18 The classic reply to this
anxiety was that labour displaced from the manufacturing sector would be reabsorbed in
the service or information sector. For several decades, this optimistic prediction seemed to
be borne out by the course of events. As I suggested in Chapter 5, the diminishment of
“direct labour” in production has been complemented by a expansion in “indirect”
labour—both in the field of technoscientific work and in the myriad tasks of marketing,
transportation, public service, cleaning and caretaking that constitute the social matrix of a
highly automated economy.
Today, however, there are signs that this logic may be exhausting itself. For the same type
of technological systems which decimated manufacturing jobs are now being applied in the
tertiary sectors meant to soak up the surplus labour displaced from industrial production. In
the banking, insurance, wholesale and retail industries, companies are using seamless, end-
to-end information processing systems to eliminate whole layers of employees. Moreover,
the acceleration of this process is an unacknowledged aspect of the 'information highway.'
Teleshopping, video on demand, and virtual services mean the mass liquidation of clerks,
salespeople, and other supernumeraries.19 As the spate of layoffs in telecommunications


428
demonstrates, those who are building the highway are the first to go. Capital is automating
not just the factory but the entire social factory.
In many advanced capitalist economies--including those of Canada and much of the
European Economic Union--unemployment rates are now at levels unthinkable fifty years
ago. In the US, visible joblessness is much lower. However, the relatively low US official
unemployment figures quite possibly disguise the scope of the job crisis behind a huge
expansion of part-time and temporary work--the so-called `McJobs,' which in effect
institutionalise chronic underemployment.20 This situation certainly can't all be laid at the
door of automation. The global relocation of labour (capital's other major weapon against
workers, itself made possible by technological advances in transportation and
communication) is a factor. There are also are further cyclical, organisational and
demographic elements in play. Nonetheless, attempts to deny the contribution of
technological redundancy, along with all the negative multiplier effects of decreased
consumer demand, seem increasingly obtuse. So serious is the consequent crisis of social
disintegration that even some mainstream economists now concede that a serious problem
exists.21 And within the last few years several social theorists from a very wide variety of
perspectives--Stanley Aronowitz and William De Fazio in The Jobless Future, Jeremy
Rifkin in The End of Work, Barrie Sherman and Phil Judkins in Licensed to Work--have
acknowledged that we may be in view of the point foreseen by Marx, where the
replacement of living labour by machines fatally undermines the wage relation.22
Potentially, the extraordinary productivity increases created by high levels of automation
could be realised in terms of general increases in income and/or supported leisure time.
There emerges the potential for what Paolo Virno terms;


429
The reduction of obligatory labour time to a virtually negligible part of life,
the possibility of conceiving employment as one of the moments of
existence and not as forced labour nor as the source of a permanent
identity.23
However, because capital continues to impose the linkage of income to work (for all
except the owners of the means of production) a diametrically opposite situation is
produced: an intensified availability for work, enforced by the immiseration of
unemployment. Thus, "the time of non-work, which is a potential richness, presents itself
within the established system as a lack, as poverty."24 Alongside practices of global
relocation computerisation has in many sectors of the economy--and quite probably across
the board--decreased the demand for socially necessary labour within the zones of
advanced capitalism, thereby restoring what Marx identified as the central weapon of
capitalist command over the working class--the maintenance of a permanent "reserve
army" of the unemployed.25
The fear of joblessness promoted by accelerating high-technology automation is a
sword held at the throat of labour. It undermines trades union strike power, and allows
management to coerce employee `co-operation,' recruit desperate strike breakers, and
drive down wages and working conditions. As workers compete amongst themselves for
employment, capital sifts them into different strata--the declining core of permanent
employees needed to run the new production systems, the periphery of temporary and part-
time workers called up according to the fluctuations of the economy or the production


430
cycle, the absolute rejects destined for the welfare lines or starvation. Labour is segmented
into an increasingly vicious hierarchy whose rungs tend to correspond and reinforce
discriminations of gender, race and age. Those at the top must work ever harder, faster and
more flexibly to save themselves from the immiseration below. Those at the bottom buy
survival only at the price of super exploitation, pricing themselves into a job so cheaply it
is not worth replacing them with machines.
Faced with this convulsion, the usual response of the socialist left has been to call
for the creation of `more jobs,' engineered by a renewal of Keynesianism or an adjustment
of interest rates. Not only does this response run in the face of the actual capacities of
technological innovation, but it forgets that, in origin, socialism was not a project for the
extension of wage labour, but for the ending of what was understood as an exploitative and
dominative institution: `wage slavery.' The reduction of this aspiration to a call for full
employment--a call, moreover, made more implausible by every advance in computer
science--dramatically reveals the attachment of social democratic and trades union leaders
to the basic structures of capitalist society, at the very moment when these walls are being
breached. Putting the wage-form on an elaborate life-support system is a strategy of
"making some people toil unnecessarily so that they can be paid without others
complaining that they are hanging around with nothing to do."26
One sign of more creative thinking is the re-emergence of an issue Marx saw as
vital to the emancipation of labour, but which has since the end of World War II been
largely abandoned by trades unions--the shortening of the working day.27 Demands for the
reduction of hours without loss of wage are now on the agenda of the most innovative
sectors of labour revolt in North America, as in Europe, and even entertained by social


431
democratic thinkers.28 This strategy builds solidarity between the employed and the
unemployed. Rather than dividing those impoverished by too little work and those
exhausted by too much, it aims for a situation where "everyone works, but only a little."29 
However, the real significance of such demands is that they point toward an even
more radical possibility, namely, dissolving the link between work and income by the
institution of guaranteed annual income. The case for this step is quite simple: capitalism
has created a productive capacity so great that there is no necessity for anyone to suffer
want because they cannot sell their labour time. Moreover, this productive capacity arises
from an economic system so socialised--so much the product of a “combined effort”
occurring not just in workplaces but households, schools and general social intercourse--
that the allocation of income only to those who exert themselves at the immediate point of
production is neither just nor even efficient. The social risks of people freeloading on a
system of generalised income are now infinitely less than the problems created by
consigning increasing masses to an income-less, because work-less, future.30
As Steve Wright notes, the institution of a universal guaranteed income "has long
held an honoured place within . . . autonomist discourse."31 In the 1960s and 70s, theorists
such as Negri were already suggesting that the automation and socialisation of production
had rendered labour theories of value anachronistic. They saw this as marking a crisis, not
for Marxism, which has always seen wage labour as an historically transitory form of
social organisation, but for capital, which depends on upholding the necessity and
rationality of the wage relation. Groups in the midst of militant shop floor struggle argued
that both rising technological productivity and the increasingly evident social nature of
production should be recognised by the creation of a social wage, equal for all, tied to


432
needs rather than performance, and available to those outside the traditional realms of paid
work, such as houseworkers and students. This is sometimes known as the "zerowork"
position.32
Such ideas were subsequently elaborated, popularised and watered-down by Andre
Gorz, whose provocative writings are informed by a considerable familiarity with
autonomist thought.33 One of the few left optimists about computerisation, Gorz in the mid
1980s suggested that the reductions in labour-time made possible by microelectronics were
opening "paths to paradise."34 The realisation of these prospects was, however, impeded
by a "living dead" or "impossible" capitalism that preserved the wage and the market
beyond the moment of their historical validity, retaining them merely as techniques of
domination.35 Gorz rejected the traditional left focus on dignity in work, which he believed
that rationalised and deskilled technological production made unattainable. Instead, he
argued that the cutting edge of social activism lay in the demand for freedom from work.
To this end, he proposed a program for a social income, distributed through life,
based on the requirement to perform a (low) minimum amount of socially necessary labour;
twenty thousand hours in a lifetime, or about ten years full-time, twenty years part-time, or
forty-years of intermittent work).36 If this was implemented, Gorz suggested, work would
no longer be a full time occupation or the centre of social existence. A wide variety of
rhythms and styles of activity would coexisting, creating rich opportunities for citizens to
exercise their creative powers "autonomously," freed from the "heteronomous" constraints
of work. "Let us work less," Gorz wrote, "so that we all may work and do more things by
ourselves in our free time."37


433
Gorz's work has had an ambiguous legacy. By developing the autonomists' rather
sketchy hints about a universal income, he pushed the frontiers of left imagination beyond
the boundaries of `a fair day's wage for a fair day's work.' But he also partially discredited
the idea of liberation of work by associating it with a sort of apolitical voluntarism.
Whereas autonomists had always emphasised that freedom from work was something that
had to be fought for against capital's tendency to reimpose the commodification of human
activity, Gorz often seems to suggest that a general reduction of labour time could be
realised simply by dropping-out from the wage economy. In his most notorious statement he
suggested that we must say "farewell to the proletariat," as post-industrial socialism is
quietly invented in do-it-yourself, back-yard experiments of the new "non-class of non -
workers."38 Because of this his work has been widely criticised from the left as simply a
recipe for what Wright calls "self-managed poverty."39
An insistence on the contested nature of the guaranteed income project is critical
because versions of the idea have in fact also been proposed from the right. Indeed, its
advocates include such free-market champions as Milton Friedman.40 During the Nixon
administration, a legislative proposal in the US Senate for a form of Guaranteed Annual
Income (GAI) was only narrowly defeated; in Canada in the 1980s a version of the idea
was proposed by the Liberal MacDonald Commission.41 As De Angelis points out, these
plans "to separate access to income from the labour market" are in fact designed only "to
make the latter function effectively."42 In such proposals, GAI is set low (well below the
poverty line) and delivered in terms of negative income tax; the minimum wage is also
low; and other social wage programs (unemployment insurance, welfare, family
allowance) are abolished. The aim is to use the GAI to rationalise state expenses, to


434
eliminate their universality, and to allow capital to pay inadequate wages, with the effect
"not of eradicating poverty and unemployment, but of making them socially acceptable."43
In the light of this "big business version" of a guaranteed annual income, some anti-poverty
activists are now intensely sceptical of the entire concept, believing it has been fatally
coopted.44
However, at the same time, the intensifying crisis of unemployment and social
disintegration precipitated by computerisation and globalisation has made others on the left
increasingly interested in the concept. A new generation of autonomists have taken up the
task of going, as Wright puts it, "beyond Gorz," developing schemes for a guaranteed
income that "do not just coexist with capital, but can be used as a means to challenge it."45
Their line of thought intersects with work on the same topic from a very wide variety of
left and liberal orientations. Examples include the sustained theoretical arguments for a
universal income offered by Philippe Van Parijs in the Netherlands; the campaigns waged
by the Basic Income group in the United Kingdom; and proposals from political economists
such as Diane Elson in England, Adam Przeworski in France and Eric Shragge and Sally
Lerner in Canada.46
Drawing on these sources, one can suggest some of the features of a guaranteed
income scheme as it might figure in our commonwealth. Its level should be set high--very
well above the official poverty line. To the degree that such an income coexists with wage
labour, as it might in the early stages of its introduction, it should be adequate to free
people from the necessity of selling their labour power, even if the possibility of
supplementation by this means continues. Its level should expand as and if the productivity
of society grows, and accompany a generalised and egalitarian reduction in waged work


435
time, to a point where guaranteed income eventually supersedes the wage as the main
source of livelihood. Although receipt of such an income might initially be tied to some
obligation to perform socially useful labour, this would not be construed in terms of
participation in traditional paid productive employment (making it a `workfare') but of
fulfilling responsibilities such as care for children, the sick and elderly. And it should be
seen as an integral part of an expanding package of freely distributed services and use
values, from housing and schooling to health, associated with the development of co-
operative and collective forms of administration discussed later in this chapter, that would
encourage forms of social solidarity going beyond the cash nexus.
Such an innovation would have multiple ramifications; I will comment on only
three. First, the guaranteed income concept, while partly flowing from the technological
crisis of paid jobs, also converges with feminist demands for the economic recognition of
domestic labour. In the 1970s, Mariarosa Dalla Costa and Selma James integrated Marx's
observations on the socialisation of labour with the direct experience of millions of
women, and pointed out the vast amount of monetarily unacknowledged, invisible but
economically essential household labour done for free. Their proposal--immensely
controversial within the women's movement--was "wages for housework."47 Although this
has been criticised as an attempt to commodify domestic work, it is in fact clear that Dalla
Costa and James intended "wages for housework" as a strategy to explode the wage form
completely, undermining the attachment of income to a (male) job. Today, the drive to
compensate domestic work is attracting widespread attention through the work of feminist
economists such as Marilyn Waring.48 A guaranteed annual income of the sort described
here--perhaps tied to a requirement for men and women alike to participate in activities


436
such as raising children, caring for the sick and elderly--would effectively annihilate the
hierarchical division of waged and non-waged labour which has so closely entwined
capitalism and patriarchy.
Second, although the "zerowork" perspective focuses on reducing the overall
amount of socially necessary labour, it should not be understood as precluding efforts to
make what remains more enjoyable. Even in a society with a high level of technoscientific
development, there will be tasks which, because of their inherent complexity, or their
intrinsically satisfying nature, cannot or should not be automated. Although the
commonwealth will abolish `work' as we know it--'work' as synonymous with `job,' `boss'
and `wage'--there will still be labour to be performed. Contrary to Gorz's gloomier
statements, I do not believe that even highly technological tasks have to be alienating.
There is now a vast literature on the enrichment and the qualitative improvement of such
labour. Mike Cooley, from a trades unionist perspective, has written on ways in which
computer systems can be designed to re-skill, rather than de-skill workers.49 More recently,
Shoshona Zuboff, from an enlightened managerial position, has discussed the ways in
which high -technologies can be used to “informate” workplaces rather than “automate”'
them, expanding workers knowledge and control over operations rather than reducing and
eliminating it.50 The only (albeit very serious) problem with such analysis is that it usually
represses the degree to which such humanising innovations contradict capitalist
imperatives of labour control and cost-reduction. Outside of this context, trade-offs
between productivity and gratification could become a matter of social choice rather than
profit-driven imperative. When a guaranteed income frees people from the necessity of
enduring degrading, monotonous jobs there is every prospect for a creative remaking of


437
labour. Thus, as Van Parijs suggests, the abolition of work should be seen as unfolding
"along two converging routes: by giving work an ever-smaller place in life and by making
it less and less like work."51
Third, freeing people from the compulsion to perform wage labour creates
opportunities for more profound and creative involvement in other aspects of social life.
One common and important objection to schemes for post-capitalist, self-organised
societies is that they assume onerously high levels of political participation: Oscar Wilde's
quip that "socialism is a good idea, but it requires too many evenings" springs to mind.52 If
one assumes a world like the present one, where most people are exhausted after eight, ten
or twelve-hour days of waged labour--plus the longer hours of unwaged domestic duties
and `double shifts' which are the indispensable accompaniments of the current job system--
this is a telling point. However, not the least important aspect of a guaranteed annual
income and a drastically shortened and flexiblised work schedule is that they leave people
with time and energy, some (though by no means all) of which can be devoted to collective
discussion and decisions -and in ways that might even be rewarding and enjoyable. In other
words, zerowork creates the communicative preconditions for other aspects of
commonwealth. This potentiality can be enhanced by ensuring accessibility to the
extraordinary communication systems that are, along with automation, the other major
technological creation of information revolution. This is the prospect taken up in the next
section.
Zero Commodity: Communication Commons


438
Under capital's direction, successive waves of electronic communication
technologies--the radio, television, telecommunications and computer networks whose
networks now girdle the planet--have served mainly as the basis of vast, vertically and
horizontally integrated commercial media empires. The consequences barely need
rehearsal: an envelopment of society in corporate speech; market censorship of news and
artistic expression; increasing privatisation and stratification of access to information; and
a relentless interpellation of audiences in the name, not of citizenship, but of consumerism.
The erosion of publicly owned media exacerbates these tendencies. Insofar as such
institutions exist within advanced capital economies--and here conditions vary from the
rudimentary services in the US to the more developed institutions of Canada and Europe--
the public ownership of media has largely centred around state-financed public
broadcasting organisations. Always existing, like the other institutions of the welfare state,
in an uneasy relationship to the market society that surrounds them, these organisations are
now subjected to intensifying corporate encroachment. This proceeds under the
watchwords of deregulation, the reduction of governmental limits on free enterprise
activity, and privatisation, the conversion of state institutions into corporate property. It is
associated both with the use of new technologies to outflank and fragment the audiences of
public broadcast systems, and, even more importantly, with the ideological claim that the
potential of new communicative technologies can only be realised by market forces. The
net result is to deepen the communicative subsumption of society by capital.53
And yet, at the same time, electronic media display quite contrary tendencies that
radically subvert the logic of the market. Because advanced communications networks can
circulate information goods very fast and very widely, goods that are by their very nature


439
dependent on extensive availability of appropriate machines, skills and knowledge,
imposing commodity exchange in this area has proven extraordinarily difficult. A wave of
everyday media `piracy,' including photocopying, home taping, bootlegged videos, unpaid
reception of satellite signals, copying of computer software and hacking is informally
decommodifying information flows. These practices constitute a clandestine shadow-world
that obstinately follows the attempt to enclose information in commodity form.54To give
only one example, in the United States, where theft of satellite television signals was to be
prevented by scrambling, it is estimated that half the descramblers are now used illegally.55
Of course, much of this illicit activity is folded back into commodity form through black
market industries. However, what is remarkable is that so much corporate effort --both in
terms of technological design and legal activity--is today being exercised to restrict what
the media corporations ostensibly promote, that is the, literally, `free' flow of
information.56
 
To understand this dynamic, we can elaborate on a hint of Marx's. He argued that a
crucial motive behind the capitalist development of communications was its drive to
shorten the circulation time of commodities--to speed the passage from commodity-form to
money-form and back again. But Marx also observed that there was a limit to this
acceleration. If a product passes instantly, without barrier or impediment, from producer to
consumer, it destroys the moment of exchange. A commodity must remain in the owner's
hands long enough to be sold. Capital might wish to maintain the continuity of circulation
by passing through its different phases "as it does in the mind, where one concept turns into
the next at the speed of thought."57 But this dream cannot be realised. For the commodity to
retain it essential attribute--that of being bought and sold--its passage must be interrupted:


440
"it must spend some time as a cocoon before it can take off as a butterfly."58 Today,
electronic technologies are making a whole range of commodities central to the information
economy--computer software, films, video, television programs, electronic music and
games and a proliferation of digital goods--into instant butterflies. Disseminated at
virtually "the speed of thought" through electronic and digital channels, they take on aerial
and evanescent forms difficult to contain within the commodity-form.
Nowhere is this more apparent than on the computer networks which capital hopes
to make the central technology in its new wave of accumulation. The famous hacker slogan
"information wants to be free" displays a naive technological determinism, but its
mystification contains a kernel of truth—namely, that many people want information to be
free, and are finding in cyberspace the means to make it so. The Internet makes available a
voluminous amount of information in uncommodified form. Vast banks of data are
available for free. Creators who prefer to see their work used rather than sold have
dropped large amounts of software into the Net gratis. Others have been electronically
`liberated' from commercial owners and given instantaneous world-wide distribution.59
Information society theorists have long pointed out that "ethereal goods" have qualities
anomalous in a market economy: they can be used simultaneously by many people, be
duplicated and transmitted cheaply and instantaneously, are not `consumed' or exhausted by
use and may grow in use-value the more widely they are shared. These features have
become increasingly problematic to those concerned with policing digital commodity
transactions. For what has emerged in cyberspace are collectivities of users who, rather
than being subordinated to the laws of commodification, are rather characterised by a
persistent, indeed often gleefully overt, transgression of these rules. The massive confusion


441
that now reigns over copyright and patent law in the electronic domain suggests that the
enforcement of property rights in this arena will be extraordinarily vexed.60
Just as capital's introduction of new technologies, by potentially freeing huge
surpluses of time, have unintentionally opened up prospects of liberation from work, so its
expansion of new communication technologies inadvertently opens up a world of counter-
usage. As computerised automation, by reducing socially necessary labour time, makes
possible either intensified exploitation or subversion of the wage form, so electronic
communication, by reducing the necessary circulation time for information goods, opens
onto two diametrically opposed options. It makes possible either a radical intensification
of commodification--through pay-per services and consumer surveillance--or a
fundamental attenuation of the commodity form, through the generalised transgression of
electronic property rights.
Our commonwealth would build on and amplify this latter decommodifying
tendency. Dorothy Kidd and others have referred to this process as the creation of a
"communications commons"--a counter-project against capital's attempts to "enclose" the
immaterial territories of airwaves, bandwidths and cyberspaces in the same way it once
enclosed the collective lands of the rural commons.61 However, this project would advance
along lines different from the state-operated public broadcasting systems favoured by a
previous generation of left media activists. While certain aspects of the public--service,
state-financed model remain valuable, these need to be revitalised and transformed by
combining them with the more decentralised and diffuse practices of alternative media,
from microwatt radio to community cable to the Internet.


442
Advocates of state-financed public media often find it difficult to marshal support
against privatisation, in part because of the frequent elitism, remoteness, over-
professionalisation, and under-accountability of the institutions they defend. On the other
hand, while the networks of autonomous media--the alternative press, community radio,
public access TV, microwatt broadcasting and grassroots computer networking--have been
the site of fertile experimentation in popular participation and public access, they have
been stunted by the lack of resources which accompanies social and economic
marginalisation. Recently, however, analysts from a variety of backgrounds have begun to
rethink the democratisation of communication in terms, which blend elements of the public
service and alternative mode. They propose the public financing of a multiplicity of
decentralised but collectively or co-operatively operated media outlets, licensed on the
basis of commitment to encouraging participatory involvement in all levels of their
activity.
Thus for example John Keene, writing from a liberal position, has argued that the
undermining of "both arcane state power and market power,"
. . requires the development of a dense network or "heterarchy" of
communications media that are controlled neither by the state nor by
commercial markets.62
Noting that "the new technologies strengthen the tendency whereby the element of rights to
dispose of property privately becomes obsolete in the communications field," Keane
argues for policies which would encourage the tendency for communication "to be seen as


443
flows among publics rather than as an exchange among discrete commodities which can be
owned and controlled privately as things."63 This would involve a democratisation of
public broadcasting institutions, aimed at introducing greater accountability to and greater
involvement of their various constituencies; creation of networks of leased-back
broadcasting facilities made available for use by a wide variety of groups and
collectivities; the support of cooperatively run publishers, community radio and public
access television; publicly funded faxes, videotext systems and electronic mail facilities;
and networks of media training and research institutions.
Somewhat similar suggestions have been made by Douglas Kellner. Drawing on his
experience working on alternative television projects, Kellner suggests that the
technological capacity for the multiplication of satellite and cable channels, often seen as a
threat to public broadcasting, should be embraced as a offering the potential for a more
diversified and decentralised version of such a service. He has urged the creation of a
publicly funded satellite system, which, along with appropriate training and production
facilities, would permit communities and movements from a wide variety of political and
cultural orientations to broadcast their own programs.64
Popular support for decentralised and distributed public communications systems
has been particularly strong in the field of computer networking. The development of the
Internet arose, as we have seen, from a certain bizarre conjunction between publicly-
funded institutions--the original military-research ARPA Net--and the autonomous activity
of a host of hackers, techno-hobbyists and computer dissidents. In North America, the
attempt to defend this unique experiment from commercial recolonisation by the
`information highway' has evoked a wealth of proposals for more fully releasing the


444
democratic and participatory potential of digital technologies. Many of these come not
from the usual centres of the left but rather from technoscientific workers most familiar
with the radical potentialities of the new technologies. Couched in idioms that combine
liberalism, libertarianism and undeniably communist impulses in an uncategorisable
amalgam, the challenge of such initiatives to the prerogatives of corporate media empires
is nevertheless unmistakable.
Thus, for example, a critique of the `information highway' put forward by Computer
Professionals for Social Responsibility (CPSR) is predicated on "freedom to
communicate," which it defines as having two essential features: first, freedom from
censorship, and, second, "the opportunity to be heard in the first place."65 This later is
explicitly defined in terms of overcoming the condition so pithily defined by A.J.
Leibling’s aphorism that "the freedom of the press belongs to those who own one.” CPSR
suggests that the availability of increasingly cheap computer technology presents the
possibility of breaking the corporate monopolies of communication established in print and
broadcasting.66 Recognising the importance of the Internet in establishing a model of open,
participatory computer communication, CPSR also notes its disadvantages--difficulties of
navigation, technological complexities, and limitations of access.
It then makes the following proposals for a public network. There should be
universality of access, defined not only in terms of availability of connections (with full
service to homes, workplaces and community centres), but also of low pricing, and the
provision of subsidised hardware, software, and training. A basic feature of the network
should be to enable all users to act as both producers and consumers; "every user . .. must
have the option to generate new information as well as publish that information through the


445
network." While CPSR concedes commercial interests a major role in the construction of
the networks, it insists on preservation of "diversity of content."67 Common carrier status--
preventing the control of content by the owners of the channels--is crucial. A central aspect
of any information infrastructure must, CPSR says, be the development of a "vital civic
sector," constituting "public spaces" for discussion, governmental interaction, distribution
of free software, and "the spontaneous development of communities of all kinds " amongst
"groups . . . of people who want to discuss issues concerning their neighbourhood,
worksite, nation or planet."68
Other local branches of CPSR have gone further. The Berkeley chapter calls for a
national computer network infrastructure to be publicly built and maintained; for the
creation of a "public information treasury" specifically aimed to "ensure that the widest
possible kinds of social information are collected; and for the abolition of intellectual
property laws."69 On this last point, it notes that the ostensible and traditional rationale for
such property rights is to promote progress and creativity. However, current patent and
copyright systems do not perform this function but rather lead to secrecy, duplication and
litigation. As the CPSR activists observe, other models exist for organising and rewarding
intellectual work in ways that do not require proprietary title to the results--such as grants,
peer or public recognition. They therefore call for a moratorium on computer software
patents, accompanied by social funding of research and development, and the
implementation of new systems, such as public competitions, to spur development of
"socially needed technology."70
Even partial implementation of these ideas would represent a significant collective
inroad on the capitalist information economy. But the significance of such a socialisation of


446
media goes well beyond the immediate reappropriation of resources from corporate
conglomerates. Every communicational node and link established outside the control of
capital diminishes its ability to naturalise commodification, to impose its `class-ifying'
grids of surveillance, to suppress news of struggles, to censor, mystify and deceive.
Conversely, each instance of such counter-communication increases the possibility to
explore variegated images of decommodified human identity, circulating struggles, and to
discussing the reorganisation of society outside the parameters of the market. Because
today's cultural industries take as their productive material forces basic to the constitution
of individual and collective subjectivity, their liberation from capitalist control in turn
enhances every other escape attempt.
Establishing a "communication commons" would both reinforce, and be reinforced
by, the abolition of work proposed in the previous section. Diminishing the role of wage
labour in society involves not just economic but cultural metamorphosis. This
transformation would include lifting the cultural opprobrium attached to the sheer
enjoyment of free time; validating the skill, difficulty and worth of undervalued or non-
market activities--such as collective decision-making or domestic labour; and constructing
forms of subjectivity other than those revolving around the image of the `consumer.' A
diverse communication commons provides the matrix for such cultural experimentation,
while the free time made available by the reduction of work creates the condition for the
widespread involvement in cultural production necessary to give the new networks
vivacity. Moreover, the establishment of such a commons creates unprecedented
opportunities for co-operative organisation--not least in the sphere of social governance, to
which it is now time to turn.


447
Zero State: Computerised Counter-Planning
To pose an alternative to advanced capital is, necessarily and centrally, to raise the
issue of planning. In the socialist tradition, centralised state planning has been the
alternative to the market. The years of the high technology revolution have also, and not
coincidentally, been a period during which both the necessity and viability of the nation
state as a central unit of social organisation has been seriously challenged. This challenge
has, however, appeared simultaneously in two different and antagonistic forms:
privatisation and socialisation.
Marx glimpsed both these tendencies a century ago. Writing of the roads, railways,
and canals of his age he described "the production of the means of communication, of the
physical conditions of circulation" as part of "communal, general conditions of social
production as distinct from the conditions of particular capital and particular production
process."71 As capital expands in scope and scale, such systems become increasingly
necessary for individuals to reproduce themselves as members of a social collectivity and
"and hence to reproduce the community, which is itself a general condition of productive
activity."72 Marx noted that the enormous cost of investment in such infrastructures usually
resulted in capital leaving their initial development to the state: only subsequently does
business reclaim them from the realm of "public works" as sources of private profit—
precisely what we know as `privatisation.’73 This take-over of the means of communication
and other public infrastructures represents "the highest development of capital" and
"indicates the degree to which the real community has constituted itself in the form of
capital." 74


448
But Marx also saw a contrary tendency. For example, in Grundrisse he describes
how institutions of information, such as the mails and telegraph, are established by capital
in an attempt to overcome the "crises, etc." that arise from the contradiction between
increasing global "interdependence" and the "indifference" of privatised production.75 The
new means of communication are instruments in the "autonomisation of the world market"--
the alienation of human powers to a vast transpersonal apparatus of monetary exchange.76
Yet at the same time, they open "relations and connections" with the potential to overcome
this alienation. They introduce the possibility of "suspending the old standpoint" and
replacing it with a "real communality and generality" that affirms the "general bond" of
planetary humanity77
Today, the privatising tendency is of course actualised the neoliberal program of
marketisation and deregulation. Its essence is the reversion of the apparatus of government,
which the era of the welfare state had (as a result of pressures from labour and other social
movements) attained a certain `relative autonomy' from the immediate imperatives of
business, back into direct instruments of capital accumulation. In some respects this
involves a diminution in state functions: the erosion of welfare expenditures, reduction in
social services, sale of public industries. In others, it expands these functions--most
notably in the intensification of the state's security, surveillance and coercive role.
Privatisation abolishes the state only insofar as it presses the interdependence of capital
and state to the point of identity, making the latter, in effect, the direct administrative and
coercive arm of the former. As Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari put it "Never before has
a State lost so much of its power in order to enter with so much force into the service of the
signs of economic power."78


449
This fusion of capital and state relates to the issue of information technology in
several ways. It is increasingly through the state, by means of government-industry
consortia, university-business partnerships, training and education schemes, military
contracts, and business subsidies that capital mobilises the range of co-operative social
activities necessary to generate the technological innovations on which it depends.
Moreover, much of the drive to privatisation is aimed at expropriating technoscientific
systems first developed as public utilities and now sufficiently advanced to become
profitable for private operation; hence the selling off of telephone-systems, research
institutes, library resources and so on.
At the same time, high technologies allow corporate power to exercise both the carrot and
the stick in compelling privatisation and deregulation. The stick is the threat of capital
flight into the global webs of investment and speculation. The carrot is the promise (to
compliant regimes) of instrumentation for reducing costs--automating public service jobs,
intensifying surveillance of welfare `cheats', deploying Robocop-like security forces to
mop up social disintegration, and so on. And this technologically-aided reduction in social
expenditures is itself one of several avenues to reduce the so-called tax burden on
corporations, thus freeing funds for the gigantic investments required by new high
technology systems. The emergent conditions of technoscientific production are thus
profoundly connected--both as end and means--to the dynamic of privatisation.
Confronted by this onslaught, the usual response of social democratic parties and
trades unions has been a defensive cry for the maintenance of the welfare state. But calls
for a return to the era of Keynesian `big government' are as inadequate as the demand that
unemployment be solved by `more jobs.' They forget the important critique of the welfare


450
state mounted by workers, feminists and anti-poverty movements during the 1960s and
1970s, which addressed not only the quantitative limits of social expenditures and
programs but also the qualitative problems arising from their frequently demeaning and
invasive administration.79 It is important to recognise that neoliberal success in
deregulation and privatisation rests in part on mobilising these real popular resentments
against remote, bureaucratic and hierarchical forms of state power. Moreover, a purely
defensive response to privatisation neglects the real possibilities for more responsive and
participatory “governmentality”  than that of the old Planner State.80
The `withering away of the state’ was once viewed on the left as an occasion for
jubilation rather than dismay. This perspective can be maintained without lapsing in to any
sort of anarchist romanticism.81 The response to neoliberal privatisation should not simply
be a plea for return to the welfare state, but rather a project for destatification of a different
kind--one which restores and increases social expenditures, but devolves administrative
power towards a multiplicity of collective, democratic projects and agencies.82 This
project of "destatification downward" or "socialising without statifying," a long-standing
element in the autonomist tradition, has recently been voiced from many other sections of
the European left.83 Broadly speaking, such proposals aim to relay financial and
administrative control over publicly-funded governmental services away from the state
apparatus towards a variety of other social loci--housing and medical co-operatives,
social and cultural centres, research and innovation centres. The role of government is
redefined as supporting collective initiatives rather than substituting for them, diffusing
rather than concentrating control, nurturing social transformation from the bottom up rather
than engineering it from the top down.


451
The potentiality for this diffusion arises from the proliferation of ecological,
feminist, labour, educational, housing and public transport activism that has been such a
marked feature of capitalist societies over the last twenty-five years. Such activism
constitutes an already-existing tissue of agencies and organisations, many operating at
sophisticated levels of administrative, technological and communicative practice. This can
be seen as an arena of "counterplanning"-- a term autonomists have used to designate the
ability of socialised labour to run things according to priorities different from those of
capital, either on shop floor, or in the social factory as a whole.84 Destatification
downward rests on reinforcing and amplifying this nascent network of counterplanning
agencies and institutions, so that they play an increasing role in the conception and
administration of governmental regulation and spending in the workplace, welfare,
education, health, and environment. Where privatisation dissolves the state into capital
with the aim of better subordinating society to corporate will, "socialising without
statifying" reabsorbs the functions of the state within myriad non-commercial collectivities
with the aim of surrounding and encroaching on capital from a variety of directions.
The products of the information revolution can be put to serve this alternative at
least as effectively as they are now being marshalled in the service of privatisation. Within
the context of "communication commons" of the sort outlined in the previous section,
computerisation and telecommunication could provide the channels for access to data and
analysis, co-operative assistance, and easy-to-use accounting and administrative systems
necessary for complex and decentralised systems of social self-organisation. Indeed, we
are now witnessing, in embryonic form, the emergence of such capacities.


452
For example, in the US, agitation by green groups has resulted in the establishment
of Right-to-Know Computer Network (RTK Net). This offers free, online access to the
U.S. government's Toxics Release Inventory (TRI), with information on industrial releases
of toxic chemicals from some 24,000 U.S. industrial facilities. Grassroots groups around
the country have used TRI information to produce dozens of reports on pollution, garnering
public attention and compelling industry cleanup efforts in a number of states.85 In Canada,
the Ottawa-based Rural Advancement Foundation International, which serves as a
clearing-house and information source for movements of indigenous people and First and
Third world farmers fighting biotechnological enclosures, uses electronic data-base
searches to identify pending corporate patent claims. It disseminates its analysis via World
Wide Web.86 To these examples can be added others--feminists co-ordinating proposals
for international conferences by email; unions establishing in-house electronic data-bases
on health and safety practice; community networkers making available public information
on health or recreational activities on free-nets. All these experiments are in various ways
using the networks to accumulate and distribute knowledge and co-ordinate activities on a
scope and scale that was previously the prerogative of state and business organisations.87
Limited as these instances are, one can extrapolate from them to envisage the potential role
of computers in providing the fibres for destatification from below.
Indeed, here it is possible that information technologies may help resolve a major
dilemma of the left--that of large-scale economic co-ordination. It is widely held today that
on this issue there exist only two options--the Free Market, or the Command State--and that
the latter of these has been decisively discredited.88 Neither, in my view, offers a desirable
prospect, the former because it drives inexorably toward the commodification of human


453
life-time, the latter because of its tendencies--tragically demonstrated in previously-
existing socialism --to official despotism. Reformist combinations of state and market in a
mixed economy have revealed their extreme instability.89 In this situation, attempts to
envisage an emancipatory social order seem stymied between two unacceptable choices--
command by money or bureaucracy: non tertium datur.
There is, however, a third way, periodically proposed by the anti-authoritarian left:
decentralised democratic planning, sometimes known as participatory economics. The
classic riposte to this suggestion is that the volume and complexity of information required
to co-ordinate a modern economy could never be processed in time to allow any exercise
of democracy or participation. However, the emergence of highly distributed, very fast
information systems throws this rebuttal into question. Some radical economists are now
asking whether the extreme sophistication of contemporary communications technologies
does not make feasible highly decentralised forms of planning previously considered
unwieldy, eliminating the need to chose between the "single brain" of the centralised state
or the blind exchanges of the market.90
Proposals along these lines encompass varied, perhaps contradictory, possibilities.
For example, the socialist-feminist Diane Elson envisages a crucial role for
communication systems in her vision of a "socialised market."91 Elson's economy assumes
a guaranteed income--along the lines discussed earlier--and a situation where production is
predominantly in the hands not of corporations, but co-operatives, the self-employed, or
publicly-owned but worker-managed companies. Centralised economic planning would be
limited to the setting of a guiding strategy by means of fiscal and monetary policy, with the
daily co-ordination of supply and demand left to the market. However, the market would be


454
"socialised" by rendering it transparent. Enterprises would be obliged to divulge
information about the design, production processes, price formation, wage conditions, and
environmental consequences of the goods that they make. Publicly supported collectives--
"consumers unions"—analyse this data, and propose norms to govern various aspects of
these practices. Information about actual production processes and proposed norms would
then be disseminated via universal communication networks--something like the Internet or
the information highway--publicly supported so that every individual, or at least every
household, had easy access to telephones, photocopiers, fax machines, computers, and
modems.
In this way, Elson says, people could know what enterprises offered, not merely in
terms of price but of social and environmental costs of what was consumed. In a situation
where it would be immediately apparent what goods had been produced in low-wage or
environmentally dubious conditions, shopping would, she suggests, become a series of
decisions about the collective, as well as individual, costs and benefits of goods selected.
Collective control over information is thus interpreted in terms of democratisation rather
than centralisation.92 Arguing that "open access to information is the key to conscious
control of the economy," Elson concludes by arguing for a strategy that aims to "attack
capital's prerogatives over information, and to begin to develop networks which prefigure
those a socialist economy would need."93 Issues ranging through environmental and
consumer protection, industrial democracy, and open government should be woven into a
coherent campaign around access to information "appealing to a wide range of non-
socialists as well as to socialists, while going to the heart of capital's ability to exploit
labour."94


455
 
Michael Albert and Robin Hahnel propose an even more comprehensive model of
decentralised planning.95 They conceive a society in which production and consumption are
entirely organised by decisions of workers' and consumers' co-operatives. Initial
statements of needs, in the case of consumer councils, and capacities, in the case of
workers councils, are matched and then adjusted one to another according to what emerges
about the overall situation. This process proceeds by several rounds of discussion or
"iterations," ascending and descending through various levels of neighbourhood, regional,
national, and international organisation. Now, this is of course precisely the sort of scheme
that might be suspected of taking so long nothing would ever get produced or consumed.
However, Albert and Hahnel argue strongly that the rapidity of information-processing,
speed and scope of communication and relative ease-of-use of contemporary computer
technology would make involvement in the process no more complex or time consuming
than the daily processes we take for granted in a market economy
These models are, as their authors admit, necessarily abstract and schematic. But
the possibilities they raise of linking high-technology communications to non-statist
planning models are important. If we consider the incredible sophistication of the
electronic networks now used by  global stock exchanges, or  corporate just-in-time
production, or military Star Wars systems, the prospect that these might be used to
facilitate highly decentralised forms of collective negotiation, decision-making and
resource-management does not seem far-flung. By facilitating economic co-ordination
without commodity exchange or dependence on centralised state bureaucracies, the
information technologies capital has created dissolve a major barrier to actualising a non-
capitalist alternative.


456
Zero Technology? The Reconstitution of Machines
Writing of technology, Marx observed that;
Nature builds no machines, no locomotives, railways, electric telegraphs,
self-acting mules etc. These are products of human industry: natural
material transformed into organs of the human will over nature, or of human
participation in nature.96
How far the author recognised the significance of this apparently casual distinction must
remain unsure.97 What is certain is that today the issue of whether technology is conceived
as an organ of "will over" or "participation in" nature marks a momentous line of struggle.
For capitalism, the use of machines as organs of "will over nature" is an
imperative. The great insight of the Frankfurt School--an insight subsequently improved
and amplified by feminists and ecologists--was that capital's twin project of dominating
both humanity and nature was intimately tied to the cultivation of "instrumental reason" that
systematically objectifies, reduces, quantifies and fragments the world for the purposes of
technological control.98 Business's systemic need to cheapen labour, to cut the costs of raw
materials, and expand consumer markets gives it an inherent bias toward the piling-up of
technological power. This priority--enshrined in phrases such as `progress,' `efficiency,'
`productivity,’'modernisation,' and `growth'--assumes an automatism that is used to
override any objection or alternative, regardless of the environmental and social


457
consequences. Today, we witness global vistas of toxification, deforestation,
desertification, dying oceans, disappearing ozone layers and disintegrating immune
systems, all interacting in ways which perhaps threaten the very existence of humanity and
are undeniably inflicting social collapse, disease and immiseration across the planet. The
degree to which this project of mastery has backfired is all too obvious.
Confronting this catastrophic scene, one understandable response is an outright
refusal of technoscience. This, for example, is the position of the eco-feminist Maria Mies.
Writing primarily in the context of a discussion of biotechnologies, but referring also to
computerisation, Mies argues that high technology is so implacably stamped with a
capitalist/patriarchal logic of domination that it can only be met by an act of absolute
refusal. Marxism, because of its attachment to technological development, is rejected. Any
leftist who uses a computer is "schizophrenic."99 The project of oppositional politics is
defined as the construction of a society based on "subsistence production" which largely
repudiates machine production, and happily accepts voluntary frugality.100 This type of
perspective is now widespread in ecological, feminist and anarchist movements.
Contrary to the celebrants of pre-industrial conditions, I would argue that  a return
to such relative impoverishment sets the likely conditions for the reimposition of all the
most unpleasant forms of parochial and patriarchal tyranny. Notwithstanding the enormous
problems of environmental degradation that have accompanied their development,
machines are a prerequisite for creating the surpluses that support human freedom.
Moreover, the technological changes that have already been wrought on the natural and
social habitat are often irreversible. Short of accepting the need for mass extinction of
surplus peoples (as some misanthropic sections of the ecology movement do) the


458
sustainability of human society can no longer be predicated on reversion to a supposedly
natural, pre-industrial condition. Rather, it will require continuous levels of intervention
and management even in order to contain or undo the dangers already set in motion by
damage to the planetary ecology.101
This interpenetrating of `first 'and `second' natures is not necessarily terrible. As
capital has been compelled by labour struggles to develop technologies that could
potentially end the need for wage work, so it has been spurred by green activism to create
machines that potentially diminish the depletion of the natural world. Computer and
communications networks could (if used in conjunction with electricity sources other than
catastrophic megaprojects) be elements in a benign and careful planetary metabolism
which, rather than pillaging and defiling ecological systems, repaired and protected them.
Indeed, the experiments of many ecological movements--for example, in the satellite
mapping of endangered resources--demonstrate this capacity. However, just as capital
makes of automation a means to increase people's availability for work, so it deforms
resource-saving technologies into means to extend and intensify the reduction of nature to
raw materials. Undoing this paradox requires a governance of technology free from
capital's compulsion to convert the world into commodity-form.
Thus, rather than rejecting technological development tout court it seems more
useful to reconsider whether there is some possibility of breaking with the capitalist
project of technology as "will over nature" and of developing Marx's hint that machines
might instead be developed as organs of "participation in nature." This of course was the
issue raised by Herbert Marcuse nearly fifty years ago when he called for the possibility of
an alternative technology based on active partnership with nature rather than Promethean


459
conquest.102 His suggestion was stingingly attacked by Jurgen Habermas, who, in a highly
influential article, accused Marcuse of a romanticism that confused the proper domains of
"communicative" and "instrumental" reason.103 The natural world was mute and never
could become a co-participant and interlocutor in the development of technology, but must
always remain an object of human control.
In my view, however, Habermas's refutation is not definitive. Marcuse does not
have to be understood as proposing a conversation with dolphins, owls and rain forests,
but a dialogue among humans who perceive a more reflexive and participant relationship
with such creatures than instrumental rationality acknowledges. The development of
machines as "organs of participation in nature" means recognising that the human wielders
of technology are embedded-in and dependent-on the world they transform, and intervening
with an awareness of the limits and uncertainties that flow from this recursive situation.104
Moreover, as Andrew Feenberg has argued, since the time Marcuse issued his call,
the project of developing a new science and technology has taken concrete social form.
Social movements in conflict with the technoscientific agenda of capital ---feminists,
ecologists, community health, and worker movements--have, at both theoretical and
practical levels, challenged the characteristic methods, preoccupations, and institutional
structures of corporate technoscience.105Such movements have attempted to develop modes
of investigation and experimentation that do not align themselves with the assumptions of
capitalist progress. In a field of workplace, medical and environmental settings they have
challenged the rigid instrumental division between subjects and objects of knowledge, and
investigated research practices emphasising holism, interaction, complexity and self-
reflexivity. They have questioned the privileging of certain forms of theoretical inquiry


460
over others--for example, the adoption of physics rather than biology as model of scientific
inquiry--and disputed the automatic dismissal of alternative knowledge-systems, such of
those of indigenous people. They have experimented both with using the machines capital
designed in ways differently from what was intended, and in intentionally designing
machines in ways different from capitalism.106
Technoscientific innovation is a collective, social process. It is not so much
something that capital creates as appropriates—an activity it must forcibly shape and twist
to its purposes, by acts of exclusion, repression, and marginalisation. Moreover, scientific
practices are manifold rather than monolithic. Thus, although reductionism, fragmentation
and "will over nature" are elements in technoscientific endeavour to which the path of
capitalist development has given precedence and emphasis, they are not the whole story.
As Evelyn Fox Keller has argued from a feminist perspective, they are only part of a more
complex and variegated bundle of impulses and approaches associated with scientific
activity, which also includes very different tendencies toward holistic perspectives,
reverence, curiosity etc.107 If these aspects have been devalued in capital's expropriation of
social knowledge, they have never been completely extinguished, and can be revived.
The commonwealth would create space for these emergent counter-knowledges and
alternative ways of doing. It would not reject technological development, but broaden its
scope, opening and creating institutions to allow the emergence of experiments, innovations
and logics other than those which have hitherto been admitted, and assessing them not
according to the needs and priorities of capital, but by far more widely-determined
criteria. As the many movements and theorists now arguing for a "democratisation of
technology" point out,


461
 . . . a democracy deep enough to function even at the level at which the
machines are shaped--from the uses to which those machines are applied to
their design and construction and use."108
Theorists such as Andrew Feenberg, Richard Sclove, Michael Goldhaber and Hilary
Wainwright have done valuable work in suggesting non-capitalist criteria which might be
applied in evaluating technologies for collective adoption--for example, the degree to
which they support ecological sustainability, local economic self reliance, satisfying work
experiences, flexible life scheduling, and equalitarian and diverse social relations.109
They have also suggested the array of new institutions necessary to make
application of these criteria feasible. These include the creation of extensive opportunities
for citizen involvement in technological research, development, design and strategic;
publicly funded organisations to assist communities research and develop technologies
shaped to their needs; public programs to overcome traditional patterns of marginalisation
and exclusion in the institutions of science and technology; and a wide array of collective
bodies to monitor, test, evaluate and debate the consequences of specific lines of research
and determine the level of funding for their development, possible redirections, or
termination. As Douglas Schuller observes, while these approaches could not and should
not control technoscientific innovation, which indeed depends on the surprising and
unpredictable, it could shape its trajectory--just as capitalist control today channels it, but
in very different directions.110


462
The only shortfall of this approach is the apparent reluctance of many of its
advocates to recognise that the adoption of such arrangements, on any large scale, is
incompatible with capitalism. For the liberal-sounding slogan "democratisation of
technology" is, if taken seriously, tantamount to a call for the reappropriation of the means
of production, and will be resisted by established power accordingly. Such a
"democratisation" is, however, consistent with a non-capitalist commonwealth
characterised by decentralised, networked collective planning and an abundance of free
time. Moreover, the advance of such initiatives for the collective control of machine-
development is itself a way of struggling for the institution of such a commonwealth.
The commonwealth outlined here is clearly not a primitivist one based on the
abolition of machines. But  it does imply a very different relation between machines and
people from that which exists under capital--to a degree that perhaps subverts commonly
accepted notions of `technology.' Historically, machines have incarnated expropriation
from the means of production. In their fixity of design, industrial technologies embodied --
or metallised--the alien will of their owner, so much so that sayings like a `cog in the
machine' summon up a world of dispossession and powerlessness. Indeed--as Marx often
pointed out--in a certain sense this association with dominative power became definitive
of what a machine is.
There are in play today, in social struggles and in everyday experimentations like
hacking, tendencies to erode this situation. The commonwealth envisaged here would
accelerate this dissolution. In particular, it would undo the line of machine development
(dynamic in some respects, narrow and constrained in others) that in the name of progress
and efficiency assumes the status of a natural law, repressing question or deviation and


463
cancelling the autonomy of the humans it ostensibly serves. Instead, the selection or refusal
of particular paths of innovation would be the outcome of collective reflection and
discussion.
This collective decision-making might well lead to the phasing out of certain
machines which the capitalist structuring of everyday life has made indispensable (such as
the private automobile) or the rapid development of others (such as the universal provision
of adequate cooking and clean drinking-water facilities on a global scale) to which it has
paid little or no attention. In the absence of capital's compulsion to accumulate, any number
of more, less or differently technologised futures, currently ruled out of play as inefficient
or non-economic, become available. This would not be because of any magical translation
to some realm of infinite abundance, but because a self-organised society is empowered to
make the difficult decisions as to how to allocate its resources.
If the commonwealth itself has any technological imperative, it is a paradoxical and
self-reflexive one--namely, that there shall be enough machines to permit choice about
whether to develop more machines. Sufficient automation to free ample time from work, a
communications infrastructure capable of acting as an organ of democratic debate and
planning enable collective decision and reflection. The aim is to subordinate the
imperative aspects of technology to the collective, communicative determination of social
directions.
Future Seed
I have pointed to various ingredients for the creation of a social order different
from capital. The elements for this alternative are to hand, but not combined. They exist,


464
here-and-now, but only here-and-there, just as at certain point in the pre-history of capital
its various ingredients--wage labour, market exchange, new machinery--all existed in
scattered form but had not cohered--or been violently welded--into a new order.
Under what conditions, and through what pressures, the new ensemble might come
into being is uncertain. I do not believe its emergence is inevitable. It is, however, obvious
that capitalism is experiencing serious difficulties in managing the world-transforming
technologies it has itself bought into being. The problems of sustaining employment in the
face of blisteringly-fast automation; the consequent contrast between restricted
consumption power and endlessly expanding production; the tendencies of social spending
cuts to erode the very public infrastructures on which technological development depends;
the repeated failures to restrain the depredation of the planet’s ecology; and the manifest
instabilities introduced by the lightening-fast transactions of global financial markets
(recently dramatically revealed by the melt-down of the South East Asian economies) all
suggest that maintenance of  the existing order may be a project no less utopian (in the
negative sense of inviting incredulity) than the creation of an alternative.
What is offered here is not so much a blueprint as a battlefield map. It does not
identify an agenda to be implemented `after the revolution,' but a series of initiatives whose
advancement would contaminate and overload the circuitry of capital with demands and
requirements contradictory to the imperatives of profit. Pursuit of these interrelated
measures would cumulatively undermine the logic that binds society around market
exchange, and increasingly require the reassembly of everyday activities into a new
configuration.


465
The actualisation of such an alternative will, however, be contested. While the
recent disintegration of Soviet state-socialism presents the historically unusual case of a
system so demoralised and undermined that it collapsed without major exercise of force, a
repetition of this pattern should not be assumed: "present policies are not accidental:
capital will put up a fight."111 Insurrectionary concepts of revolution--the storming of the
Winter Palace--are today a dead letter. But capital’s capacity to unleash violence against
any serious challenge is undiminished. To agitate for social change while ignoring this
would be to act in bad faith.
I can imagine a commonwealth born in extreme tumult. It could come out of mounting civil
disorder arising from intensifying unemployment and social disintegration, accompanied by
increased activity of proto-fascist militias and extreme-right parties, and resistance against
them. A social democratic government elected to implement part of the commonwealth
program--say, a guaranteed annual income—might face a reactionary coup, whose defeat in
turn propels deeper social transformation. A region or nation attempting to secede from the
world-market by debt-repudiation might actualise some parts of the program, at the risk of
invasion or intervention. At worst, the alternative may emerge in the wake of ecological
catastrophe or the devastation of inter-capitalist war.
Whatever path their actualisation might take, the measures suggested here,
combined in some concerted society-wide ensemble, would make up a world very
different from that which we today accept as normal. It would be a world where wage-
work would have a steadily decreasing importance or vanish entirely; where, although
there would be labour to be done, livelihood would not be dependent on a job; where,
consequently, people would have more time to think about and participate in decisions


466
about organising life in association with others; where they would have access to a very
wide variety of communication channels, with a very wide diversity of representations and
images about different possibilities of being; where these channels served also as routes
for a flow of participatory decision making about the production and distribution of goods-
-and also about the directions taken and not taken in technological development. Distant as
these prospects may seem, they are potentialities germinating in the soil of our everyday
lives, today.

56 As Nicholas Garnham observes in Capitalism and Communication, there is a
contradiction at the heart of the communication commodity, arising from media business's
need to simultaneously maximise and restrict istribution. On the one hand, they want to sell
as much as they can. Therfore they increase the speed and efficiency of communication
methods to reach more people, more of the time, in more and more various ways. But on
the other hand, media corporations want to sell as much they can; they are interested not
just in getting out messages, but in getting back money. So they confront a paradoxical
requirement to expand and restrict comunication at the same time--simultaneously creating
plenty and imposing scarcity.

70 This suggestion is also made by Tessa Morris Suzuki, Beyond Computopia. This call for
the elimination of property rights will seem problematic for many artists, researchers and
cultural workers. For people in these areas the propensity to piracy inherent in electronic
technologies threatens their livelihood. They would like to see intellectual property rights
in this area revised to strengthen the rights of the immediate producers against the large

enterprises publishing houses, music businesses, software giants who purchase and dispose
of their work. And they would be aghast at the prospect of forgoing royalties and other
revenues on which their activities depend. Within the current, capitalist, context, legal
protection for these producers is appropriatea and necessary. The dismantling of
intellectual property rights should start from an assault on the legal fortifications of the
corporations who are the beneficiaries of the current system, not of individuals and small
organisations. Its full realisation could only be part of the overall constititution of a
commonwealth aimed to break fundamentally with market logic, as part of an entire
'package' which includes measures such as a guaranteed income which fundamentally
undercut the need for people to worry about selling their intellectual or physical labour
power.

necessarily identifying such activities with the functions of the centralised state. See

81 See Kenneth Surin, "Marxism(s) and "The Withering Away of the State." Social Text
27(1990): 35-54.
82 I agree with Joachim Hirsch, who in "The New Leviathan & The Struggle for
Democratic Rights." Telos 48.(1981) 79-89, argues that what is necessary is "reduction of
the role of the state" in the sense of "a collective reappropriation of responsibilities, self-
management, autonomous interest organisation, debureaucratisation and decentralisation;"
this program is valid even though it will necessarily conflcit with attempts "to exploit anti-
state and and anti-bureaucratic resentments for quasi-populist, reactionary mobilisation and
social-political austerity strategies."
83 Wright, "Confronting the Crisis of Fordism," describes how some Italian autonomists
now argue a guaranteed income based upon the free distribution of selected social services
could provide a starting point from which to build for the further extension of a self-
managed sector where need takes priority over profit and provide a "motor of a process of
reappropriation of the welfare state's institutions and services, based upon the expansion of
self-managed social labour and cooperation.'He also shows how the idea of
reappropriation of the welfare state 'from below' has been expounded by Marco Revelli, a
member of the more traditional left with autonomist affinities, who believes that "the
welfare state has finally run its course:" " Since it is now both 'useless to the bosses [and]


477
                                                                                                                                                
alienating to workers', a political strategy based upon an unconditional defence of the
welfare state would be 'suicidal'. Its current crisis can only lead to two outcomes: either
towards a social 'free-for-all' such as can be found in the United States, where each must
fend as best they can, or else 'a more mature "sociality"' based upon mutual aid. Many
examples of the latter, he points out, already exist in Italy: above all, the thousands of
cooperatives and mutual societies which provide health care and other social benefits to
their members." The left's aim, Revelli suggests, should be to expand this area of welfare
from below, and "to reconstruct those autonomies that the inevitably bureaucratic
apparatuses of the parties, unions and state have dispersed." For an example of such
thinking from an Anglo-Saxon perspective, see Hilary Wainwright, Arguments For a New
Left: Answering the Free Market Right (London: Blackwell, 1994).

interpreted as open access to all available information concerning the product and its
price, so that any decision-maker has access to the same information as any other . . . Such
a system of coordination does not require simultaneous processing of large amounts of
information, of the kind necessary for effective central planning (which, even with the
latest computer technology is argued to be unfeasible). Rather it requires the gathering and
processing, at discrete intervals, in separate bundles, of information already generated by
enterprises for their own use, such as unit costs and levels of inventories, and process and
product specifications. The barrier to this is not technical: current levels of micro-
processor technology can certainly handle this kind of information processing very rapidly
. . . The barrier is not technical: it is social and political" (1988, 43).

97 Marx's other writings contain elements both of the frank scientific triumphalism common
to his age (elements later amplified in scientific socialism) and also insights into the
metabolic interconnection of humanity and nature which prefigure contemporary ecological
thought.For discussions of the 'green' Marx see the journal Capitalism, Nature, Socialism,

Despite the title of the paper, Mies addresses issues across the span of high-technology
development, including what she terms "indundation with 'technical means of
communication.'" See also her Patriarchy and Accumulation on a World Scale: Women in

101 On this point see Felix Guattari, "The Three Ecologies," New Formations 8 (1989) 146-
147: "Increasingly in the future, the maintenance of natural equilibrium will be dependent
upon human intervention; the time will come, for example, when massive programs will
have to be set in train to regulate the relationship between oxygen, ozone, and carbon
dioxide in the earth's atmosphere .. . What is required for the future is more than the mere
defence of nature. If the Amazonian 'lung' is to be regenerated, the Sahara desert made
fertile again, we need, immediately, to go on the offensive. Even the human creation of new
plant and animal species looms unavoidably on the horizon; the urgent task we face is, then,
to fashion an ethics appropriate to a scenario that is both terrifying and fascinating, and,
more importantly, a politics appropriate to the general destiny of humanity."
