The\nfreely floating system had effectively come into play as the default\nposittion, something that US negotiators used to their advantage, by\nclaiming that they much preferred doing nothing and allowing a system of\nfloating rates. When even France and Germany decided to float, it was\nnow up to the leaders whose states would be most severely effected by\nthe breakdown in negotiations. See: Stephany Griffith-Jones, and Jose A.\nOcampo. \"Compensatory financing for shocks: what changes are needed?.\"\n(2008).</p></div>"
