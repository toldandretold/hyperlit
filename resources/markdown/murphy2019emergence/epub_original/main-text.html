<span>The Emergence of the NIEO Ideology</span>
<br/>
      Craig Murphy
    </p>
<p>
      This study traces the political history of the ideas underlying Third World calls for a New International
      Economic Order. Filling a significant gap in the literature, the book shows that NIEO ideology has a direct,
      unbroken line of development extending back to World War II, when a "new international economic order,"
      the Bretton Woods system, was created. Dr. Murphy maintains that NIEO ideology is not rooted only in Third World
      acceptance of Prebisch's views on trade; rather, it evolved from Third World attempts to cope with problems
      and opportunities that emerged as the Bretton Woods system was created, operated, and began to break down. By the
      1970s, the ideology had become a complex and coherent analysis of the economic position of Third World states,
      including a <span>political</span> analysis of how Third World views could be made dominant.
    </p>
<p>
      Many of Dr. Murphy's conclusions challenge the conventional wisdom about the Third World position of the
      NIEO. In addition, his study offers insight into the relatively unexplored area of how changes in political and
      social consciousness affect international systems, and provides grounds on which officials from both the South
      and the North can see the others' views as less alien.

      This book began as a doctoral dissertation in political science at the University of North Carolina at Chapel
      Hill. My advisor, Andrew Scott, both suggested the original idea and gave me help throughout my doctoral
      research. The other members of my dissertation committee, Enrique Baloyra, Claudio Cioffi-Revilla, Fredrico Gil,
      and Jeffrey Obler, provided me with detailed comments and suggestions. I also received suggestions and support
      from other graduate students working on dissertations in international relations at the same time, Bobby
      Childress, Tom Havener, Roseanne Lipe, and especially Doug Nelson. Paul Streeten and Margaret de Vries generously
      answered my initial naive questions about the workings of the Bretton Woods institutions. The documents
      librarians at the University of North Carolina and at Wesleyan University constantly found ways to make my
      research easier. Elizabeth Grover, the secret reason why so many of the political science faculty at the Johns
      Hopkins University write well, did much more than type my dissertation.

      Ernst Haas, Jeffrey Hart, Stephen Krasner, Wentworth Ofuatey-Kodjoe, and two anonymous reviewers read and

      support throughout the process. The editors of <span>International Studies Quarterly</span>
      helped me refine arguments that appear in <a href="#ht0009">chapters 1</a> and <a href="#ht0017">2</a> as well as in an article in their journal, "What the Third World Wants: An

    Ideology's Role in the North-South Conflict</a></h1>
<p>
        . . . any talk of giving "cultural autonomy" to the smaller countries while transferring their right
        of regulating their economic affairs (within the limits imposed on all international intercourse) to some
        <span>laisser-faire</span> mechanisms of a larger area is nonsense. If we mean by
        "cultural autonomy" something more than the preservation of picturesque costumes and out-of-date
        traditions which delight the traveller, then we must realize that it cannot develop unless a certain economic
        environment is given.
      </p>
<p>
        — Κ. W. Rothschild, 1944
      </p>
<p>
        The complaint of the poor nations against the present state is not only that we are both poor in absolute and
        relative terms and in comparison with the rich nations. It is also that within the existing structures of
        economic interaction we must remain poor, and get relatively poorer, whatever we do . . . The demand for a New
        International Economic Order is a way of saying that the poor nations must be enabled to develop themselves
        according to their own interests, and to benefit from the efforts they make.
      </p>
<p>
        — Julius Κ. Nyerere, 1974(<a href="#fn0002" id="bck_fn0002">1</a>)
      </p>
<p>
      Between the end of the second world war and the beginning of the 1970s an originally obscure set of ideas became
      central to one of the most important modern global conflicts. In the 1940s these ideas reached print only rarely,
      for example when a relatively eclectic British economist like K. W. Rothschild decided to work out some of the
      less popular implications of Keynesian economic theory. By the 1970s scores of books and thousands of pages of
      documents advanced the same views. The obscure <a id="page_2"></a>notions of the forties had become the
      organizing ideology of the largest alliance of nations ever assembled. This book is a political history of that
      new ideology, the New International Economic Order (NIEO) ideology. It describes where the ideology came from and
      how it became a force in international relations.
    </p>
<p>
      Like some older economic ideologies influencing international relations -- mercantilism, laissez faire
      liberalism, Keynesian liberalism, and Leninism -- the NIEO ideology defines an ideal system of global economic
      relations. But the new ideology is not mercantilism; advocates of the new order support conscious international
      management of global economic relations. It is not Keynesian liberalism; the new ideology's supporters reject
      creation of international institutions with powers limited only by the rational dictates of economic science. And
      the new ideology is neither laissez faire liberalism nor Leninism; new order advocates reject the idea that a
      single type of domestic economy need be imposed worldwide before a just system of international economic
      relations can exist.
    </p>
<p>
      One thing distinguishes the new order ideology from all of the older major ideologies that have influenced
      international economic relations: The new ideology is concerned with alliance politics. New order advocates
      explicitly attempt to enlist international institutions behind their program to structure the world economy.
      Their ideology governs the behavior of the alliance of third world nations within international organizations. As
      an alliance's political ideology, the new order beliefs resemble the "free world" doctrine of the
      United States and its allies and the "socialist" doctrine of the Soviet Union and its allies: All
      define positions taken in global political conflicts. The NIEO ideology underlies the proposals for a New
      International Economic Order made by the Group of 77 less developed countries (LDCs)(<a href="#fn0003" id="bck_fn0003">2</a>) and their supporters. It is one part of the current north-south conflict's
      visible, ideological face.
    </p>
<p>
      In tracing the development of this ideology, I begin in the 1940s, when the current north-south conflict over how
      the global economy should be structured first appeared. To the extent that the world economy is structured by any
      conscious public decisions, three international economic management institutions established then have the most
      influence: the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank, and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
      (GATT). Each works alongside the agencies with trade, aid, and monetary powers that are parts of the governments
      of major developed market countries (DMCs). Not only were all three of these global organizations created in the
      1940s; the ideologies framing the current economic policies of most DMCs were invented or revitalized then.
    </p>
<p>
      Following current convention, throughout this book I <a id="page_3"></a>refer to the three international agencies
      and the national actions which support those agencies as "the Bretton Woods system," even though only
      the IMF and World Bank were negotiated at Bretton Woods. The GATT's legal status, organization, and
      operations also differ from those of the two other agencies. The IMF and the Bank, more than the GATT, are true
      international governmental organizations having their own chartered powers, their own staffs, and (at least
      potentially) their own independent operational ideologies. The GATT is a contract among states; it does not
      require the staff and autonomy of the other agencies. All three institutions, plus the agencies of the dominant
      governments that provide crucial support for the institutions' goals, can be considered together for
      analytical purposes because the creation of those international organizations was informed by the dominant
      ideology of the powerful nations.
    </p>
<p>
      In the forties K. W. Rothschild characterized this dominant ideology as a desire for a weak global federation
      dedicated to laissez faire economics, a system where international management of the world economy would lead to
      free trade and free enterprise economies everywhere. This fundamental vision continues to inform many of the
      policies of the Bretton Woods institutions as well as many of the aid, trade, and monetary policies pursued by
      the major DMC governments. The dominant ideology's fundamental vision runs completely counter to a major
      theme that advocates of the NIEO reiterate constantly: their belief that the structure of the world economy
      should impose no economic principles (like laissez faire) upon nations. Rather, they believe that the
      international economy should be structured to help any nation achieve its development plans whatever the
      principles guiding that plan might be.
    </p>
<p>
      We can understand why third world leaders talk about their "rights" to "develop themselves
      according to their own interests" by seeing the new order ideology as a response to the dominant ideology
      and the system of which it is a part. Recent references, like Nyerere's, to development rights based upon a
      more fundamental right of cultural autonomy just reiterate Rothschild's view, thirty years after the system
      he criticized was created.
    </p>
<p>
      In its simplest form, then, my thesis is that the New International Economic Order ideology developed as an
      understandable response to real problems experienced by third world states as a result of the Bretton Woods
      system's creation and operation. The analyses the new order advocates offer of the economic problems they
      face may or may not be the most accurate ones, and the policies they advocate many or may not be the best; I am
      offering an analysis of the ideology's development, not a critique of its validity or value. Therefore I do
      not use the word "ideology" as a pejorative. Most practical human consciousness, including most
      scientific thinking, is <a id="page_4"></a>just as "ideological." NIEO advocates simply countered one
      ideology with another.
    </p>
<p>
      On one level, the development of the new order ideology looked like this: Each of the positions added to the
      developing ideology was adopted because it was the most satisfactory of all the available ways for new order
      advocates to understand a new, shared problem. While they sought the most accurate or "scientifically"
      correct of a set of ideas available for apprehending the new problem, that set was bounded by an
      "ideological constraint." This constraint ruled out any new ideas that contradicted any part of the
      previous new order consensus. Over time, under the ideological constraint of their prior consensus, the ideas
      third world governments adopted to apprehend and cope with their old and new problems under the Bretton Woods
      system became an ideology as comprehensive and coherent as the ideology that was part of the dominant system.
    </p>
<p>
      Together, the two ideologies constitute the ideological face of the current north-south conflict. That
      ideological conflict appears throughout statements made by the advocates of the new order and those made on
      similar topics by the people who want to continue the present system. On its face, the conflict is one between
      two specific conceptions of how international economic relations can and should be governed. The dominant
      ideology and the NIEO ideology both identify a proper realm for international, rational management of the world
      economy. The ideologies differ in the ways they define the boundaries of that realm, the main goals of such
      management activity, and the policies that should be employed.
    </p>
<p>
      The area of agreement between the two ideologies, between statements by DMC spokesmen about international
      economic matters and those made by third world spokesmen, tell us the current north-south conflict is ostensibly
      about the management of international economic relations. "Both north and south believe in conscious
      governmental intervention in the economy at the national and international levels. Adherents to both ideologies
      agree that governments and international organizations should have a role in setting economic goals and
      attempting to achieve those goals through policy. Moreover, both positions identify the international economic
      policy-making process as one that should be essentially rational? policy makers should analyze all variables that
      may influence a chosen goal, and they should choose policies to maximize that goal.
    </p>
<p>
      The differences between the two ideologies show up when we examine the limitations on the realm of rational
      economic policy making that each considers essential. The dominant ideology suggests that international economic
      policy making should never penetrate a realm of international economic relations defined by the entitle<a id="page_5"></a>ments and duties of private property ownership. Property owners must have the right to use their
      property in ways they see fit. They must be compensated when property is expropriated. Contracts must be
      enforced. The realm of property must be protected no matter how irrational private uses, policies of
      compensation, and the consequences of some contracts may be in terms of achieving international economic goals.
      In contrast, the new order ideology affirms that entitlements and duties associated with national sovereignty
      define the only proper limitations upon international economic policy making. Nations must have the right to use
      their geographically defined resources in any way they see fit, and national governments have the duty to respect
      and even foster the form of economic relations adopted by the governments of every other country despite
      irrational effects those policies may have on international economic goals.
    </p>
<p>
      The two ideologies also differ in terms of the specific concepts necessary for rational economic planning —
      goals, economic analysis, and ideas about policies that could achieve those goals in light of that analysis. The
      dominant ideology places maximization of the world's production of goods and services as its central and
      primary goal and considers subordinate goals -- such of encouraging world political cooperation, full employment,
      and economic security for individuals — as inevitable consequences of maximized production. The new order
      ideology also emphasizes production, peace, full employment, as well as some ecological goals, but it does not
      necessarily see them as correlated. Supporters of the new order emphasize trade-offs, yet say one goal,
      industrial development in the third world, should have the highest priority.
    </p>
<p>
      The two analyses of international economics differ even more when we look at the variables that are said to
      influence these goals. The NIEO ideology presents a picture of the world divided between economically central and
      economically peripheral countries in which the level of employment and level of production in the periphery are
      dependent on decisions made at the center. The dominant ideology presents a world of economic actors firms and
      individuals — that merely happen to be circumscribed by certain national laws; it argues that correctly perceived
      national interests never contradict free market policies. Consequently, the adherent to the dominant ideology
      calls for reciprocal concessions by all nations to make a world free market and prescribes ways that
      intergovernmental organizations should intervene in economic relations to make such concessions likely. New order
      advocates say that nonreciprocal policies allowing certain national restrictions on exchange are essential if we
      want to achieve the highest possible levels of production and welfare.
    </p>
<p>
      While the differences between the ideologies are <a id="page_6"></a>great, they would be less important if
      advocates of both could agree upon a way to settle disputes about principles, goals, and analyses. The desire for
      rational economic management expressed by both ideologies provides one means to resolve disputed economic
      analysis: empirical scientific study. Yet both ideologies suggest additional, conflicting means to resolve
      intergovernmental economic disputes. Adherents to the dominant ideology say that conflicts over goals and
      analyses should be resolved by direct bargaining between national governments. Implicitly, they affirm that in
      such bargaining all elements of national power — diplomatic, economic, and military — should be allowed to come
      into play; therefore, the outcomes of such bargaining must be weighted toward the self-defined interests of the
      most powerful nations. The new order ideology says that binding decisions over disputed goals and analyses should
      be made by majority rule or consensus of national governments, each government having an equal voice to reflect
      its equal sovereignty. This conflict over the right way to resolve differences keeps the sides apart even when
      new events force them to amend their views. The north-south conflict has gone through many changes without being
      resolved.
    </p>
<p>
      I organize my analysis around the five distinct phases in the north-south conflict:
    </p>
<ul>
<li>1944-59 before the Bretton Woods system began to operate the way it was designed to</li>
<li>1959-64 after the system began to operate normally but before third world states made their alliance
      formal</li>
<li>1964-71 while the system continued to operate normally and after the formal alliance</li>
<li>1971-75 after the system began to break down but before third world adversaries provided opportunities for
      compromise</li>
<li>1975 - after the first opportunities for compromise appeared</li>
</ul>
<p>
      Andrew Scott's theory of managing international interdependence and David Apter's theory of stages in the
      development of domestic mobilizing ideologies in new nations(<a href="#fn0004" id="bck_fn0004">3</a>) suggest these phases and accurately predict the innovations that occurred during each.
      The validity of these combined theories, in turn, supports the thesis that the NIEO ideology developed in
      response to the creation and operation of the Bretton Woods system.
    </p>
<p>
      Scott explains that the history of consciously created systems for structuring human relations, like the <a id="page_7"></a>Bretton Woods arrangements, can be described in three stages: formation, operation, and breakdown.
      To form the system, those who will be affected by the structure or regime must resolve conflicts over what
      relations should be governed and how that should be done. Some of the actors that will be affected by the regime
      may have doubts that are not resolved simply because they do not have the power to make their interests salient
      to others. Of course that would only happen if the regime-formation conflicts were resolved through direct
      bargaining, subjection, or some other process that takes all forms of power into account. The actors whose
      interests are not considered, therefore, have automatic grounds for grievances with the new regime. As Apter
      suggests, their grievances can provide them with the basis for a new shared moral code and a new, separate
      identity.
    </p>
<p>
      My first chapter covers the long period during which the Bretton Woods system was formed, the 1940s and 1950s.
      Asian, African, and Latin American interests in postwar regimes that would foster economic development through
      coordinating national trade regulations were excluded from the postwar institutions. Those third world interests
      became the basis for principles, goals, and symbols of identity first adopted by third world governments in the
      forties and fifties, core elements of the new order ideology that they still reiterate today.
    </p>
<p>
      As the Bretton Woods system became more and more of a reality, third world spokesmen began to offer analyses of
      the world economy that did more than reiterate their initial grievances with the Bretton Woods system. For
      example, in the fifties third world governments began to charge DMCs with manipulating the terms of trade for
      third world goods through cold war policies of stockpiling raw materials and through exceptions to GATT rules
      that DMCs granted to themselves in order to allow special trade alliances including the European Community.
    </p>
<p>
      Scott's theory of managed international interdependence explains why new problems occurred and how they were
      linked back to the Bretton Woods system itself. With his theory we can explain all of the new economic analysis
      the third world adopted as part of the new order ideology in the 1960s, the only decade during which the Bretton
      Woods system operated in anything close to the way its founders intended. Scott argues that even consciously
      managed interdependence regularly produces distressing results that no one ever intended. Most of the early
      unintended consequences of the operation of the Bretton Woods system could be ignored by the system's most
      important backers. At first the unexpected events only harmed the interests of the less developed countries that
      had never really backed the system anyway.

<a href="#ht0017">Chapter 2</a> covers the 1960s, the period when the Bretton Woods system
      operated most normally. This decade was marked by unintended results of growing international <a id="page_8"></a>economic interdependence that were harmful to third world nations but not to others. Ironically,
      partially as a result of the successes of the Bretton Wood system, the third world's share in world trade
      declined, differences in standards of living between third world and developed nations and among third world
      nations grew, some capital and skilled manpower left the third world, and transnational firms in the third world
      increased their influence over local economies. Throughout the sixties third world governments barely amended the
      principles and goals they had agreed upon previously. Yet they expanded the new order ideology's policy
      analysis rapidly as they adopted new ideas to apprehend and explain the new economic problems they encountered.
    </p>
<p>
      Apter's theory makes me divide this decade during which the Bretton Woods system functioned the most
      successfully into two phases of the north-south conflict. With his theory we can understand the one set
      ideological innovations in the sixties that Scott's ideas cannot clarify. Apter suggests that a conflict
      enters a new phase when aggrieved parties develop a new, collective political identity. The third phase in the
      emergence of the New International Economic Order ideology began halfway through the 1960s when the Group of 77
      formed. After that, the group confronted the political problem of making its ideology dominant. Throughout the
      late sixties the members of the alliance tested proposals for projecting what influence they had over DMCs. In
      the course of doing so the alliance added a political analysis to the economic analysis, principles, and goals
      which had previously made up the New International Economic Order ideology.
    </p>
<p>
      This third phase was far from smooth. Not all inter-third world dissent on global economic principles ended with
      the formation of the Group of 77. <a href="#ht0022">Chapter 3</a> begins in 1970, after the
      third world governments had agreed upon the notion that a new international economic order should be formed, but
      while the third world alliance still remained divided between two groups, each advocating economic duties under
      the NIEO. Initially these differences were based upon the different interests of the recently independent third
      world nations, on the one hand, and older members of the group, on the other. The differences disappeared from
      official statements before the south presented the new order program at the General Assembly Special Session in
      1974. By that time all third world governments had consented to having the principles first adopted by the older
      group members in the forties as the single set of principles governing the duties of wealthy states to aid poorer
      ones. The key principle they affirmed was a permanent duty of all wealthy states to aid the economic development
      programs of poorer states. In contrast a historical duty based upon restitution for colonialism, advocated by the
      newer <a id="page_9"></a>states, never obtained a similarly central a position in the ideology.
    </p>
<p>
      The bulk of <a href="#ht0022">chapter 3</a> discusses the proximate cause of the most recent
      third world convergence upon this key principle, the first signs of the Bretton Woods system's breakdown, in
      1971. Extending Scott's argument, we can distinguish a period of breakdown in a regime as one that begins
      when the inadvertent consequences of management start to harm the actors whose support the regime needs. When the
      DMCs started to refuse obligations under Bretton Woods in the wake of global stagflation, mounting trade
      deficits, and approaching energy limits to growth, the fourth phase in the development of the New International
      Economic Order ideology began. Third world ideologists had something new to discuss after 1971, the attempts to
      reform the Bretton Woods system engineered by DMCs in the wake of the system's crises.
    </p>
<p>
      At the time the new order ideology could be characterized by that Apter calls "hortatory
      realism."(<a href="#fn0005" id="bck_fn0005">4</a>) That is, while the ideology certainly
      contained many objectively accurate propositions arrived at through attempts to correctly understand real
      problems, the ideology's primary function was to keep the alliance directed toward its fundamental goals. New
      order advocates were ideologically constrained to repeat all the untested propositions in their earliest
      consensus. They did so, in part, because no opponents had expressed enough sympathy with the ideology for NIEO
      advocates to begin the sort of dialogue that could bring some of their untested assumptions into question.
      Consequently, in the early seventies new order advocates tended to limit their innovations to adding analyses of
      ways to exploit the DMCs economic vulnerabilities that had been exposed as the Bretton Woods system started to
      break down.
    </p>
<p>
      In 1975 the north-south conflict entered a new political phase, the fifth phase in the development of the new
      order ideology. By then many of the major developed states had accepted some new order proposals as the agenda
      for further north-south discussions. According to Apter, such a development should allow the third world's
      economic and political realism to turn from being "hortatory" to being "practical" as
      opportunities for realistic compromise appear. The actual record since 1975 is mixed. Compromises between north
      and south have been reached, but, in the main, third world states continue to support goals and principles for a
      new order that is anathema to at least the most powerful DMCs. <a href="#ht0029">Chapter 4</a>
      discusses the increasingly substantive new order debate in light of the few changes in the third world position
      since 1974.
    </p>
<p>
<a href="#ht0035">Chapter 5</a> summarizes my conclusions about the origin of the new order
      ideology and then looks both at and below the level of the global system to find out why all third world
      governments, which differ so much one from <a id="page_10"></a>another, can share some underlying interests that
      the ideology helps them understand and pursue. Even a superficial global view of the ideology suggests how
      complex the network of interests supporting the new order might be. The new order ideology sanctions all the
      different development doctrines around the world, doctrines that differ enough to satisfy the scores of different
      domestic political coalitions of classes and sectoral groups backing different third world governments. <a href="#ht0035">Chapter 5</a>'s analysis of the new order ideology as ideology suggests some
      simple patterns underlying the apparent complexity of domestic interests in the south. It also discusses how
      common individual experiences of members of the third world elite contributed to the ideology's development.
    </p>
<p>
      Both <a href="#ht0029">chapters 4</a> and <a href="#ht0035">5</a> suggest
      reasons for being optimistic that the current north-south conflict can be resolved through further negotiated
      reforms of the Bretton Woods system that would satisfy some of the interests underlying the NIEO ideology. In
      order for the conflict to be resolved parts of the NIEO ideology itself would have to begin to guide the policies
      the international institutions follow. But in addition to better satisfying some third world interests, the
      operational ideology of an actual new international economic order would also have to reflect the self-defined
      economic interests of the governments of developed states more fully than the new order ideology does at present.
      The Afterword looks at this problem and at other impediments to a "debated" or
      "idea-generated" resolution to the current north-south conflict. It illustrates something hopeful in
      the fact that, even on its own terms, the NIEO ideology would be inadequate as the operational ideology for an
      actual new international economic order.

    The Alternative to Bretton Woods Before 1960</a></h1>
<h2><span>Bretton Woods</span>:</h2>
<p>
        . . . typified by the dollar sign, gold at Fort Knox, international cartelism, and a spider-web of Shylocks
        squeezing out the heart of hungry multitudes.
      </p>
<p>
        — Diego Luis Molinari of Argentina, 1948
      </p>
<h2><span>And the alternative</span>:</h2>
<p>
        The undeveloped countries seek industrialization by some simple and quick route. By obtaining large loans with
        no strings attached and by offering enterprisers a monopoly of local markets they hope to build factories
        overnight. They do not believe that they must creep before they can walk.
      </p>
<p>
        — Clair Wilcox of the United States, 1949(<a href="#fn0006" id="bck_fn0006">1</a>)
      </p>
<p>
      Molinari and Wilcox represented their respective governments at meetings called to create a world trade
      organization following the second world war. Their comments foreshadow the ideas and emotions expressed in the
      north-south conflict now, in the eighties. Moreover, they reflect the actual roots of that conflict, the issues
      that first divided north and south over thirty years ago.
    </p>
<p>
      Throughout the decade and a half following the second world war governments worked to establish a new, postwar
      economic order. The war ended with little consensus on the nature of the new order aside from agreement that
      there should be some sort of intergovernmental management to facilitate expansion of global production. The
      American government wanted regimes that would eliminate national regulation of trade. In <a id="page_12"></a>contrast, most other governments wanted international regimes to approve and coordinate national
      trade regulations. Eastern European governments wanted provisions encouraging bilateral trade agreements. Western
      European governments and Commonwealth members felt that proposals mooted by the United States during the war
      failed to respect worthwhile regulations that could be used to reduce unemployment. Many leaders of what we now
      call the third world were convinced, like Molinari, that American plans would enhance the economy of the United
      States at the expense of Latin American, Asian, and African plans for industrialization, plans belittled by
      Wilcox and other advocates of the American proposals.
    </p>
<p>
      In 1959, when the IMF and GATT both celebrated their first year of normal operation, the system had become
      something less than most of its founders had envisioned. Most east European governments had rejected the new
      economic system. Western European governments and those of developed Commonwealth countries had ceased to raise
      the issue of creating an international employment regime. Yet African, Asian, and Latin American governments had
      neither muted their doubts about the Bretton Woods institutions nor withdrawn from the system. They expressed
      their doubts through proposals that granting aid to other nations be considered a duty of statehood and through
      an economic analysis which said that industrialization was desirable and viable everywhere. By 1959 governments
      in the south had adopted a core of concepts around which proposals for reforming the postwar economic order could
      be organized and through which those governments would come to recognize one another as potential allies.
    </p>
<p>
      The history of the New International Economic Order ideology of the 1980s begins, then, in the 1940s when the
      issue of creating regimes to help manage world economic relations first appeared on the international agenda. It
      begins with the worldwide acceptance of the conception that advocates of the NIEO still share with the framers of
      Bretton Woods, the belief that some degree of intergovernmental economic management is desirable. Only after the
      first Bretton Woods agreements did the south articulate a new ethic of international economic relations. This
      notion of economic rights and duties of states that morally grounded the specific global policies desired by the
      poorer states outside of Europe during and immediately after the war -- technical assistance, commodity pricing
      agreements, and multilateral aid.
    </p>
<p>
      With this ethic the founders of the new order movement presented a policy analysis justifying the reforms they
      proposed in terms of goals they shared with leaders of both the developed nations and the nations that had once
      been developed, before they were impoverished by the war. The new analysis said that a historically determined
      structure of the world economy <a id="page_13"></a>impeded optimal economic growth. This analysis began and
      remained controversial and distinct from the analysis that came to guide day to day policy making within postwar
      regimes. Yet the analysis was always politically significant. Through the new analysis, African, Asian, and Latin
      American governments could see each other as sharing economic problems distinct from those of industrial nations.
      The analysis explained the division of the world into rich north and poor south; it pointed to a concrete reality
      behind the symbol of the "third world."
    </p>
<p>
      This chapter relates the history of the first period in the emergence of the new order ideology, emphasizing that
      it developed around southern grievances with the emerging Bretton Woods regimes. Those grievances explain the
      focus of the new order ideology on global management and the south's state-centered ethic of rights and
      duties as well as the structural policy analysis accepted by many Asian, African, and Latin American governments.
      They adopted the ethic and analysis to frame specific grievances which precluded the adoption of other
      contemporary theories about international economic relations, including the slightly modified laissez faire
      theory underlying the Bretton Woods institutions. Throughout this chapter I compare that dominant ideology, which
      emerged as part of the Bretton Woods system in the forties and fifties, to those concepts that came to form the
      base of the new order ideology.
    </p>
<h2 id="ht0012"><a href="#bck_ht0012">Consensus on Global Management,
    Disagreement Over National Regulation of Trade</a></h2>
<p>
      The intergovernmental institutions involved in the management of economic relations after the second world war
      came about through negotiation. Admittedly, Americans set the agendas for international conferences and used
      threats and promises backed by American economic power to preclude some options championed by other states.
      Nonetheless, ultimately postwar institutions were not created by dictatorial fiat of a single power but by
      agreement of all the nations that signed their charters. Given that the founders had to resolve disputes among
      people with fundamentally different visions of what the world economic order should be, it is remarkable that the
      postwar system developed at all. Consensus was reached only because the Americans raised the least controversial
      issues about postwar regimes first and then helped resolve them by pointing to ways that institutions proposed by
      the U.S. would expand production throughout the world, a paramount concern for most governments.
    </p>
<p>
      When the Americans finally raised the issue of creating an international organization to coordinate national
      regulation of trade and, ultimately, left it unresolved because consensus could not be reached, most <a id="page_14"></a>nations had already agreed upon some institutions that had the ability to restrict such national
      regulation. An American desire for free trade thus became a principle of actual postwar regimes as if by default,
      and the governments that remained unconvinced that a free trade system would allow them to achieve their economic
      goals, yet accepted the new regimes, found themselves arguing against a status quo assumption that global
      management should be constrained by free trade principles. In addition, by accepting the new regime's rules
      for amendment, those governments opposing free trade made it impossible for themselves to effectively express
      their grievances within the system. Under the rules of the IMF, World Bank, and GATT, the governments opposing
      free trade had little voice. Their grievances with the new system were left to be expressed within the United
      Nations General Assembly and the short-lived conference on creating an international trade and employment regime,
      arenas in which all governments were granted equal power.
    </p>
<p>
      The early consensus on the postwar institutions that were created reflected general agreement among scholars and
      policy makers throughout the world that it was folly to allow the global economy to be ungoverned by some notion
      of the common good. They considered this a lesson of the two world wars.
    </p>
<p>
      By the early 1940s the intellectual sources of that lesson were myriad. Some democratic socialists in the early
      part of the century had predicted and supported a universal alliance among empires in which the inevitable
      conflicts of their expanding economies would be resolved. (<a href="#fn0007" id="bck_fn0007">2</a>) Studies of business cycles pointed to the interdependence of national economies and
      the desirability of coordinating anticyclical policies.(<a href="#fn0008" id="bck_fn0008">3</a>) Scholars joined policy makers in blaming restrictive trade practices for setting the
      conditions for the second world war, such as the dependence of east European economies on Germany.(<a href="#fn0009" id="bck_fn0009">4</a>) And Keynes's polemic, <span>The
      Economic Consequences of the Peace</span>, written in 1919, with its forecast of vindictive trade and monetary
      policies and the ultimate collapse of the European economy, read like prophecy. Policy makers even accorded
      Keynes's solution -- for governments to agree to jointly undertake the benign international management
      functions performed by City of London bankers in the nineteenth century -- the respect a prophet's vision
      deserves.(<a href="#fn0010" id="bck_fn0010">5</a>)
    </p>
<p>
      In countries with market economies, where government intervention was usually questioned, mobilization for the
      war brought officials practical experience in using economic controls. Mobilization also brought economists into
      government in greater numbers than ever before. An explosion of innovative exchange and production policies
      resulted, some with international implications. They ranged from the marketing boards for primary commodities in
      the British colonies to lend-lease arrangements for <a id="page_15"></a>financing expanded American production
      and Allied war needs.(<a href="#fn0011" id="bck_fn0011">6</a>)
    </p>
<p>
      Governments throughout the world helped manage economies during the war; increased intervention occurred even
      outside the combatant states. If anything, the British government more strictly managed the economies of its
      colonies and dependencies for the war effort than it did the economy of the home country. Native administrators,
      who would later become leaders of independent nations, learned the tools of economic planning during the war.
      (<a href="#fn0012" id="bck_fn0012">7</a>) Throughout the war, Latin American nations even
      received U.S. support for internal policies of economic diversification and industrialization in exchange for
      both their political and economic support of the Allies. Latin American governments attempted to negotiate
      international agreements that would help assure stable terms of trade for the goods they exported. They also
      demanded to be allowed to protect infant industries with tariffs and to receive global support for their import
      substitution policies. Throughout the war the United States supported such suggestions despite ideological
      objection to them by the highest policy makers. As the State Department put it in 1941, American free trade
      principles were "moderated in practice" to support the international agreements desired by Latin
      America.(<a href="#fn0013" id="bck_fn0013">8</a>)
    </p>
<p>
      Nonetheless, when most American policy makers thought about postwar institutions they rarely moderated their
      advocacy of liberal principles. The State Department under Cordell Hull consistently maintained that "free
      trade" and "free enterprise" should define moral boundaries circumscribing the role of any postwar
      intergovernmental economic organization. The department's notion of "free enterprise" involved both
      support for market-oriented internal policies and strong opposition to "monopolistic practices,"
      partially of firms but more especially of national governments. This included opposition to most tariffs,
      quantitative restrictions upon amounts of goods imported or exported, multilateral interference in the market to
      support the price of certain goods (commodity agreements), and special bilateral trade agreements -- all of which
      American policy makers considered means of giving monopoly-like advantages to national firms.(<a href="#fn0014" id="bck_fn0014">9</a>) The State Department supported global regimes that would create
      conditions under which unrestricted trade was possible, a system whose goals would include abolition of just the
      sort of international economic arrangements toward which the Americans had agreed to negotiate with Latin
      American states during the war. While Latin American policy makers were more typical of others throughout the
      world in envisioning postwar institutions as regulating the way national governments regulated trade, the State
      Department envisioned a world federal government dedicated to removing all barriers to trade erected by national
      <a id="page_16"></a>governments.
    </p>
<p>
      Commercial Affairs Division Chief Herman Geist accurately reflected this vision and the feelings of those who
      held it when he said:
    </p>
<p>
      Let me warn against the futile speculations of theorists who would have us deviate from sound principles in
      international trade and espouse methods of dealing repugnant to our way of life. If in the international sphere
      we reject political and social systems harmful to mankind, we must also repudiate the economic practices upon
      which they are based. If we hold fast to our destiny we shall create an indivisible and advancing civilization
      upon the foundation of our prosperity and rear a new edifice where enlightenment based on material, moral, and
      spiritual progress will finally decide the future of mankind.(<a href="#fn0015" id="bck_fn0015">10</a>)
    </p>
<p>
      From this point of view, international trade deviating from the ideal of free enterprise domestically and
      internationally — the ideal Roosevelt was to call a basic economic right in 1943(<a href="#fn0016" id="bck_fn0016">11</a>) — was anathema. Rejection of fascism implied rejection of the restrictive trade
      practices employed by fascist states. Governments that rejected restrictive trade practices could expect a
      wealthy, moral world in return. They even could expect conditional American assistance to aid economic
      development. As one official put it:
    </p>
<p>
      Plans for investing in developing the resources and diversifying underdeveloped areas must have as an outstanding
      object the promotion of international trade in the interests of all countries providing the help as well as in
      the interests of the countries receiving it. It makes little sense if governments maintain or impose new
      obstacles to trade which is sought to develop, thereby destroying the trade and investment as well. In the last
      analysis, every problem in the field of economic relations resolves itself into a problem of trade.(<a href="#fn0017" id="bck_fn0017">12</a>)
    </p>
<p>
      This statement could be read as a promise of American aid and investment in exchange for adoption of free trade
      and free enterprise policies. Geist's "foundation" of American "prosperity," the wealth
      of the United States, assured that there would be investment in poorer countries as long as they did not impose
      obstacles. In 1941 when Dean Acheson spoke of this State Department vision of a federated world dedicated to free
      trade and formed under American leadership through promises of American investment, as the "last best hope
      of mankind."(<a href="#fn0018" id="bck_fn0018">13</a>)
    </p>
<p>
<a id="page_17"></a>As Geist makes clear, some economic theorists in the early forties did not welcome this
      proposed "edifice" of international government dedicated to free trade and free enterprise. Not all of
      those theorists were apologists for totalitarian regimes. Because of the reputation of Keynes's work, which
      influenced many policy makers in the United States as well as in the Commonwealth and Latin America, and because
      of Keynes's own role as the major negotiator for Great Britain at early conferences called to create postwar
      regimes, the most serious challenge to the State Department vision was Keynesian.
    </p>
<p>
      Keynes supported the formation of intergovernmental organizations that would be more limited in their effects on
      existing restrictive national trade policies, yet more interventionist than those envisioned by the American
      State Department. Keynes wanted to give latitude to governments to regulate their trade and the use of their
      currency when the absence of such regulation might result in unemployment. Yet, Keynes wanted intergovernmental
      organizations to have the financial capability to support full-employment policies, a management role that went
      far beyond the one envisioned by the State Department.(<a href="#fn0019" id="bck_fn0019">14</a>)
    </p>
<p>
      In his seemingly prophetic 1944 article, British economist K. W. Rothschild laid out what he believed to be the
      fundamental differences between Keynesians and free enterprise advocates over matters of international trade.
      Rothschild called the free enterprise "federal solution" to problems of trade and the global economy in
      general, ". . .a remnant of the idea that the mere removal of regulation and interference will give us
      paradise on earth." Rothschild rejected that idea:
    </p>
<p>
      The frequent abuse of tariffs, quotas, and monetary methods for aggressive purposes and
      "beggar-my-neighbor" policies has clearly shown that the absence of <span>this</span>
      type of regulation would be beneficial to the vast majority of people. But the fact that certain tools are
      misused does not justify us jumping to the conclusion that the removal of tools is preferable to their proper
      use.
    </p>
<p>
      Rothschild's Keynesian position had it that the potentially beneficial effects of international trade
      restrictions should be studied rather than ruled out in principle. The Keynesians considered ruling restrictive
      policies out "in principle" to be either an unscientific response to a few cases where restrictive
      policies had proved to be detrimental or else an uncritical acceptance of theories which ignored significant
      elements of the actual world economy. Rothschild continues:
    </p>
<p>
      That the complete removal of tools is so widely accepted as the best solution is probably also due to the fact
      that the two most outstanding modern <a id="page_18"></a>books on the theory of international trade exclude
      monopolistic phenomena and problems connected with the trade cycle from the larger treatment of the subject. Will
      a consideration of them not necessitate a modification of the conclusions which were based on the assumption of
      perfect competition and a highly flexible economic system in which frictional forces play only a minor
      part?(<a href="#fn0020" id="bck_fn0020">15</a>)
    </p>
<p>
      The Keynesians thought, of course, that such explicit consideration of monopolies and trade cycles <span>would</span> necessitate new policy conclusions.
    </p>
<p>
      American officials were concerned with the ways business cycles affected trade, but when making foreign policy
      they rarely worried about how the investment decisions made by private firms affected those cycles. American
      officials downplayed the significance of firms that had monopoly powers in their own right, considering monopoly
      powers to be a global problem only when they were created by the trade practices of states. Consequently, had
      they further investigated "monopoly practices," as they understood them, American policy makers still
      would not have reached new policy conclusions.
    </p>
<p>
      Americans based their insistence upon the mutual desirability of both global free trade and the creation of free
      enterprise economies around the world on something more than generalization from the results of restrictive
      practice prior to the war. Their views reflected something more than uncritical acceptance of abstract trade
      theories. Praise of free trade and free enterprise reflected convictions developed while guiding the United
      States out of the depression. Adherents reasonably could say that these beliefs were prudent, altruistic, and
      proven in practice — if not always consistent one with another.
    </p>
<p>
      To justify that free trade could be good in itself supporters could point to the abstract theories. Those
      theories demonstrated, at the very least, that if a free trade system meeting their assumptions could be created,
      there would be opportunities for greater production worldwide.
    </p>
<p>
      Yet extensive government intervention in the status quo world economy would be needed just to create such a
      system. Intervention would be needed, on the one hand, to dismantle existing restrictive trade practices, and, on
      the other, to assure that the nations which could make or break the system had the financial wherewithal to
      benefit from the new export opportunities that the system would give them.
    </p>
<p>
      American policy makers saw creating such a system as a political task similar to the one confronted by the
      Roosevelt administration in bringing the U.S. out of the slump in the thirties: They had to get powerful economic
      <a id="page_19"></a>actors who supported the status quo of inefficient, restricted trade together with those who
      desired greater redistributive intervention in the economy to work together to increase production and support
      the <span>growth-</span>rather than <span>redistribution</span>-oriented
      interventionist policies of the government. During the depression the government<sup>'</sup>s
      partial reliance on free enterprise to expand the economy was essential to get business support for the
      interventionist programs of the Roosevelt administration. Expanding production, not redistribution of economic
      goods or the power to produce them, was the key to that program. As Charles Maier puts it, members of the
      Roosevelt administration sought to transform the class-based political problem of the depression and,
      "adjourn class conflict for consensus on growth."(<a href="#fn0021" id="bck_fn0021">16</a>)
    </p>
<p>
      Their success makes it not surprising that they brought the same focus on economic growth to debates over
      international economic relations. Under conditions that still had to be created through intervention in the
      postwar world economy, free trade could assure growth. But it was just as politically important during those
      debates that the principled insistence upon free trade by men like Hull, Geist, and Acheson served to enlist the
      support of much of the American business community behind new international institutions that would intervene in
      the world economy to help it expand. State Department support of free trade even helped legitimize the least
      market-oriented parts of the postwar order — like the system of fixed exchange rates for national currencies
      under the eye of international financial institutions controlled by governments rather than by private interests.
      This system was first championed by the Treasury Department, which was more influenced by Keynesian concerns than
      the State Department was. The State Department explained the interventionist financial institutions as a
      necessary support system for an ultimately noninterventionist free trade regime. In doing so they created
      business support for the leadership role that the U.S. government would take in making all the postwar regimes
      work, including business acceptance of the financial burden of that leadership, the massive aid and investment
      needed to assure that many nations could expand production.
    </p>
<p>
      Of course, American officials expected that ultimately such an open international economic system would further
      American interests. It would open avenues for exports that would quell the American fears in the early 1940s of
      postwar overproduction and recession.(<a href="#fn0022" id="bck_fn0022">17</a> ) An open
      international system would assure U.S. firms access to foreign raw materials, again helping to assure further
      U.S. economic growth. But, because they considered expansion of the American economy necessary if the goods
      needed by war-devastated poorer countries were to be produced, American policy makers could find a large <a id="page_20"></a>element of altruism in their insistence upon the free trade principles that would serve American
      interests.(<a href="#fn0023" id="bck_fn0023">18</a>)
    </p>
<p>
      At first, in the early 1940s when intergovernmental consultation was mostly limited to monetary and financial
      matters, Americans placed more emphasis on adjourning global economic conflict for consensus on growth than they
      did upon the principles of free trade and free enterprise. The American emphasis on expansion in general helped
      international consensus on financial and monetary matters to be reached quickly, if slightly imperfectly; the
      organizations created were unacceptable to the Soviet Union and many of its allies. The liberal Keynesians, like
      the free market theorists, accepted facilitating growth as the central goal for postwar institutions. Growth had
      been the goal of liberal economics since Smith. In the world depleted by the war, policy makers, not
      surprisingly, accepted the economists' focus on growth. Even in the countries least affected by the war, like
      the Latin American states, the central national economic goal was growth. That was the point of industrialization
      and diversification. Only in the socialist countries, where policy makers had a superordinate concern with
      maintaining socialist national economies in a capitalist world, did national goals preclude acceptance of
      international organizations designed to coordinate monetary and financial matters in order to facilitate economic
      growth.
    </p>
<p>
      In addition to the general prevalence of expanding production as a top-priority item on national agendas, another
      thing assured that consensus could be reached quickly in the early years: The issues addressed at the conferences
      for creating monetary and financial institutions did not preclude agreement at a later date upon the sorts of
      restrictive trade policies many governments desired. And when nations had central economic goals other than
      maximizing production, governments tended to relate those goals more to trade than to monetary or financial
      policy. When they agreed upon the charters of the IMF and the World Bank, all governments expected that a third
      institution, the International Trade Organization (ITO) would later be created to join the fund and the bank as
      centers of the intergovernmental regimes managing postwar economic relations.
    </p>
<p>
      Keynes's ideas illustrate why those governments which remained uncommitted to free trade considered this
      trade organization to be so important. They expected the ITO to offer an international framework for dealing with
      trade-related unemployment problems and for coordinating government programs of restricting trade to encourage
      domestic investment in countries where powerful foreign firms would not invest. Keynesians felt that these issues
      had to be resolved both because a framework was needed to maximize growth and because full employment and
      national programs for economic development were good in <a id="page_21"></a>themselves.
    </p>
<p>
      Keynesians believed that in a world governed by free trade principles, national programs to maintain full
      employment, and hence full use of productive factors, could become unworkable due to foreign recession. A country
      whose exports suddenly became less valuable because of the economic difficulties of nations importing those items
      would also suffer from the slump. Production in the export sector would be limited, and there would be
      unemployment unless that country's government were allowed to use trade and monetary policies to cushion the
      impact of foreign recessions. This view reflected a major worry the British government and the governments of
      other developed non-Axis market nations — especially Australia -- had throughout the war. They feared that their
      countries might have to suffer from further recessions in the United States where they believed anticyclical
      policies were less well developed than in their own countries.(<a href="#fn0024" id="bck_fn0024">19</a>)
    </p>
<p>
      Keynes proposed that subsidies for affected exporters and some trade restrictions (that would, in a sense, punish
      the countries that had not developed anti-cyclical policies) should be allowed in such cases. He also proposed
      that whatever sort of international bank was created after the war be mandated to help finance national policies
      that would contain the international diffusion of recession. Given the importance of bringing the advanced
      Commonwealth countries into the postwar global system, Keynes got his way, in part. The IMF came to function as a
      creditor to nations experiencing problems that had foreign causes or might have foreign effects.(<a href="#fn0025" id="bck_fn0025">20</a>)
    </p>
<p>
      Less effectively aired in the early forties were Keynesian proposals designed to increase the ability of smaller,
      less developed countries to restrict their international trade in order to diversify their economies. Rothschild
      outlines the justifications for such proposals by arguing that in a postwar laissez faire world, powerful,
      monopolistic private firms would continue to be able to decide where most investment would be made. Unlike the
      competitive firms of economics textbooks, real monopolistic firms would invest in such a way that the
      specialization resulting from free trade would fail to employ resources throughout the world with great
      efficiency. The conservative investment practices of industrial monopolies assured that they would only heavily
      invest where they had invested before:
    </p>
<p>
      If a <span>laisser-faire</span> policy is pursued the creation of a federal union will tend to
      reinforce and perpetuate the economic structure of its constituent members. The greater industrial countries will
      become centers of heavy and other monopolistic industries, the smaller countries will find oppor<a id="page_22"></a>tunities in small-scale industries and agriculture. Backward countries will remain backward just
      because they were backward before.(<a href="#fn0026" id="bck_fn0026">21</a>)
    </p>
<p>
      This was just the sort of future feared by policy makers in Latin America and in other other independent less
      developed regions. For them the free trade system might mean less than optimal growth. More importantly, a free
      trade world would be one in which they would be allowed none of their traditional powers to compensate for a lack
      of foreign industrial investment.
    </p>
<p>
      As it was chartered, the World Bank could become a lending agency that would help poorer nations combat the
      parochial investment decisions of monopolistic firms. But governments in the nations with few industries felt
      that other policies, including internationally sanctioned tariff protection of infant industries, would be also
      needed. They left comprehensive international discussion of such policies to the debates over the ITO in the late
      forties.
    </p>
<p>
      Even at the beginning of those trade discussions, the less industrialized countries' negotiating position was
      weak. Before the discussions started, the IMF and the World Bank looked like institutions that would help
      recreate the prewar worldwide division of labor and maintain it. The IMF was designed to encourage nations to
      allow their national currencies to be freely converted into those of other nations. It would try to eliminate the
      possibility that a nation could use restrictions on foreign exchange to prevent the flight of capital to more
      lucrative investments abroad. The World Bank accepted as its first priority industrial reconstruction of the war
      torn regions, first in Europe, thus helping reestablish the prewar division between a relatively industrialized
      north and relatively nonindustrial south.
    </p>
<p>
      Yet statesmen in the forties saw things differently. Despite the prescience of theorists like Rothschild on other
      matters, the possibility that the IMF and the World Bank could help recreate and maintain the old global division
      of wealth and poverty was hardly recognized when those institutions were formed. Preventing the establishment of
      such a division, and thus accounting for the Keynesian doubts about the ultimate effects of the international
      investment policies of powerful firms, was, for most concerned officials, a matter of trade policy. Trade
      controls had been the most frequently employed policy for maintaining and enhancing the relative economic
      positions of particular nations since mercantilist times. The ITO negotiations appeared to most as the logical
      place to raise such issues.(<a href="#fn0027" id="bck_fn0027">22</a>)
    </p>
<p>
      Despite the fact that creating a trade organization would remain an issue of international politics for five
      years after 1947, the actual intergovernmental institutions of the postwar system had all been chartered by
      <a id="page_23"></a>then. The last agreement was the GATT. Taken together the IMF, World Bank, and GATT
      represented a consensus among market countries that global management aimed at expanding production was
      essential. From the standpoint of a laissez faire advocate, those regimes were complete in themselves. Had they
      actually appeared complete to all governments, their creation would have represented the achievement of the
      American goal; intergovernmental economic conflict would have been overcome through consensus on growth. The IMF
      provided a mechanism for dealing with short term balance of payments problems and currency conversion, thus
      making trade easier and encouraging growth to accommodate the new trade potential that the easing of exchange
      problems would create. World Bank provisions of capital would aid war torn states and allow them to productively
      enter the world system. The GATT defined conditions under which trade would go on. It emphasized the removal of
      tariffs and other restrictions thus creating new opportunities for trade and production. Free trade theories as
      far back as Ricardo's or Smith's could be used to show why this system was designed to facilitate growth:
      Specialization encouraged by increasingly free world trade would result in the more efficient and complete
      employment of labor and capital everywhere. From the laissez faire point of view the move to maximize global
      production had begun.
    </p>
<p>
      Nonetheless, in 1947 it would have seemed odd to the delegates at international conferences on economic matters
      had anyone suggested that the postwar system was fully developed. They considered the GATT only a stopgap measure
      to encourage trade before comprehensive agreement on the ITO could be reached. GATT was designed so that export
      sectors could start to function as catalysts to growth. It reflected no agreement on trade-related goals other
      than growth, such Keynesian goals as full employment and economic development.(<a href="#fn0028" id="bck_fn0028">23</a>) In addition, in 1947 direct American aid to the war torn countries was becoming
      increasingly more important rather than less important, thus casting some doubt on the effectiveness of the
      Bretton Woods monetary and financial regimes. Even those regimes were still incompletely defined in an important
      sense: The ideas that would guide their decisions were not yet fixed.
    </p>
<p>
      In 1946, six weeks before he died, Keynes addressed the first meeting of the IMF Board of Governors. He
      encouraged them and their counterparts at the World Bank to develop independent policy analysis rather than to be
      tied to the policies and analyses preferred by their most powerful members. Keynes revealed some of that insight
      often attributed to those near death. He correctly predicted what the postwar international economic management
      system would become, forseeing the limited fulfillment of his vision.
    </p>
<p>
      IMF and World Bank charters mandated their staffs to <a id="page_24"></a>make decisions, in Keynes's words,
      "on their merits," to employ empirical analysis and rationally choose the best policies to achieve
      those goals all IMF members had agreed upon. Conscious, rational public management of the world economy had
      become a structure, a relatively permanent source of influence, in the world economy alongside the structures
      which emerge unconsciously from habitual market relations and the rarely coordinated interventions made by
      national governments. Within this unprecedented realm for making decisions in the global interest conflicts could
      be resolved by reference to economic theory and to empirical analysis of the ways alternative policies could be
      expected to affect accepted goals.
    </p>
<p>
      This much Keynes both knew and was glad of; yet he feared that this realm of conscious management to achieve
      global goals would be unduly limited by purely political decisions, decisions not reached through reference to
      the best economic analysis but ones reflecting only the interests of some predominant coalition of powerful
      governments:
    </p>
<p>
      You two brats [the IMF and the World Bank] shall grow up politicians . . . everything you shall determine shall
      not be for its own merits, but because of something else.(<a href="#fn0029" id="bck_fn0029">24</a>)
    </p>
<p>
      Of necessity, the two institutions had a specifically political element. Goals cannot be chosen by empirical
      analysis; they are a matter of political judgement. Furthermore, economists can disagree on the effects of
      proposed policies. Some extrascientific means is needed to determine whose economic analysis will guide policy
      making. Keynes's deep worry was that the political mechanisms in the postwar system would assure that his own
      sort of economic analysis would rarely be employed to solve policy problems.
    </p>
<p>
      He had reason to worry, given the political principle the postwar institutions would adhere to when resolving
      disputes that could not be resolved by referring to economic theory. This principle is that nations should be
      able to influence such decisions in proportion to the strength of their economies. Keynes's fears were well
      grounded because of the predominance of the American economy and the propensity of American policy makers to
      prefer laissez faire analysis. In the IMF and the World Bank the principle of granting influence in proportion to
      the strength took the form of voting rights weighted on the basis of a formula primarily reflecting levels of
      production.(<a href="#fn0030" id="bck_fn0030">25</a>) Even under the GATT this principle was
      established through rules for negotiating tariff reductions which required states not to award preferential
      tariffs to any nation while encouraging direct bargaining between all nations. <a id="page_25"></a>Nations with
      more diverse and productive economies could make more concessions than poorer nations in order to achieve the
      specific liberalizations they desired, and they could stop making concessions long before reducing all their
      barriers to trade with poorer countries.(<a href="#fn0031" id="bck_fn0031">26</a>)
    </p>
<p>
      Due to their adherence to this political principle, the IMP and World Bank could only become widely legitimate
      management institutions if their most powerful members sometimes acted selflessly. Wealthy members had to
      restrain themselves from using those institutions soley to advance their own interests and their own ideas about
      correct economics.
    </p>
<p>
      Some American actions in the forties suggest the U.S. accepted this restrained leadership role; others suggest
      the U.S. abandoned the role to pursue interests that were narrowly its own.
    </p>
<p>
      At first, in the late forties, many governments came to question the American commitment primarily because the
      U.S. started to insist upon its free trade principles as soon as the ITO negotiations began. Editorials in the
      liberal London <span>Economist</span> are good indications of European and developed
      Commonwealth doubts. During the first ITO conference in 1945 the <span>Economist</span>'s
      exasperated editor wrote of the American delegate that his, "simple-minded identification of free trade with
      prosperity, world peace, and economic freedom sounded out of date. "(<a href="#fn0032" id="bck_fn0032">27</a>) Throughout the following two years the <span>Economist</span> would
      decry the U.S. for caring a great deal about increasing the volume of world trade while failing to recognize that
      a modern economy has other needs than maximizing wealth,(<a href="#fn0033" id="bck_fn0033">28</a>) for offering much to American business in its ITO proposals while offering nothing
      that would aid the world's working people, and for failing to offer to redistribute the world's wealth in
      the face of existing global scarcities. (<a href="#fn0034" id="bck_fn0034">29</a>) The last
      point reflected the fact that the Europeans' slowly growing awareness of the extent of the war's
      destruction made them ask that the U.S. share its wealth.
    </p>
<p>
      New American pledges of economic aid for postwar reconstruction of the formerly wealthy parts of the world, over
      and above pledges to the World Bank, certainly reflected American willingness to accept some of the
      responsibilities Europeans understood to be incumbent upon the world economy's leader. After the announcement
      of significant loans to Britain and the development of the Marshall Plan, the tone of the <span>Economist</span>'s editorials changed. They first accepted and ultimately supported British
      involvement in a global economic system under American leadership. The U.S., while it called the shots, still
      loaned enough that others could join the game.(<a href="#fn0035" id="bck_fn0035">30</a>)
    </p>
<p>
      European demands for American aid triggered similar demands from those poor nations which, like Ethiopia and a
      few countries in Asia, had suffered from the war as <a id="page_26"></a>long as any other Allied state. Those
      countries had not been included in the American programs. Similar demands even came from poorer countries that
      had not been so directly affected by the war.
    </p>
<p>
      At the 1947 ITO conference, where the GATT was negotiated, American pledges of aid became a salient issue. Actual
      American pledges of aid served to diminish European and developed Commonwealth insistence upon a postwar regime
      that would allow wide trade restrictions. At the 1947 conference, pledges of Marshall Plan aid even created a
      majority behind the preliminary charter proposed by the U.S. Pledged aid could provide the capital for industrial
      reconstruction, including purchases from the U.S. that would serve to keep the American economy booming; the U.S.
      had removed the need to restrict trade in order to force domestic reinvestment, and had shown itself willing to
      intervene aggressively to make sure its own economy did not go into recession.(<a href="#fn0036" id="bck_fn0036">31</a>)
    </p>
<p>
      In 1948, partially toward the same end of achieving agreement on free trade principles, the U.S. government
      offered to cooperate within the United Nations system to encourage economic development in countries that had
      never been industrialized. This offer was less effective than promised Marshall Plan aid in rallying support for
      American proposals since it was tied to the requirement that the U.S. government be allowed to evaluate the
      extent to which development plans were ". . . soundly conceived, mutually consistent, and effectively
      coordinated." (<a href="#fn0037" id="bck_fn0037">32</a>) The second <span>Annual Report</span> of the World Bank, publicizing the bank's lending policies for the first
      time, suggested what those words might mean both to the only existing United Nations aid organization and to its
      most powerful member. The report stressed that governments applying for aid should encourage liberal trade and
      the free flow of capital within their country as well as see that all their national debts to private firms, most
      of which were firms in the U.S., were quickly paid. (<a href="#fn0038" id="bck_fn0038">33</a>)
      Rather than construing the American offer as one of exchanging development aid for acceptance of international
      laissez faire, most less industrialized nations read the American offer as an attempt to prescribe internal as
      well as external free market economies in the interest of American firms.
    </p>
<p>
      Between 1947 and 1948 the ITO conference moved from Europe to Havana and expanded to include many more
      representatives of Asian and Latin American countries. In Havana the United States made its pledges to provide
      aid to poorer countries within the U.N. But throughout the conference, delegates from Asian and Latin American
      countries waited in vain for the U.S. to announce a program of the scale and kind of the Marshall Plan -- a
      program of substantial direct aid to the development projects chosen by leaders in recipient countries. A <a id="page_27"></a>clear American statement came only after the ITO conference. At the Inter-American conference in
      Bogota a reporter confronted Secretary Marshall with the argument that the economic need of Latin America was
      greater than that of Europe because on average Latin Americans consumed fewer calories than Europeans. Marshall
      answered that the United States planned no direct aid to Latin America. He said that the benefits of American aid
      to Europe would "trickle down" to the poor of Latin America if Latin American governments accepted free
      trade principles. Increasing European demand, particularly for agricultural (not industrial) goods, would mean
      economic growth for Latin America. (<a href="#fn0039" id="bck_fn0039">34</a>) This was the
      unacceptable answer negotiators from the poorer countries had come to expect by the end of ITO conference.
    </p>
<p>
      Without the promise of acceptable American aid, the majority at the 1948 ITO conference transformed the free
      trade charter into the charter of an organization that could support some restrictive trade policies. Molinari
      made his emotional statement about the U.S. position, quoted at the head of this chapter, at this conference.
      Under the leadership of the larger Latin American states and India, the ITO conference amended the American
      proposals by accepting articles governing preferential tariffs, commodity agreements, and bilateral trade
      agreements as well as by accepting the principle that the ITO would make decisions on the basis of one nation one
      vote.(<a href="#fn0040" id="bck_fn0040">35</a>) But the fluidity of the international
      situation in 1948 and the fact that the U.S. did not firmly reject the less industrialized nations' demands
      for economic aid until after the ITO conference allowed American delegates to retain some free trade elements of
      their charter, including the central position of the GATT as the basis for tariff negotiations.(<a href="#fn0041" id="bck_fn0041">36</a>)
    </p>
<p>
      The charter that came out of the Havana meeting was a compromise only in the sense that it represented a middle
      ground. It was not a compromise acceptable to most of the governments represented at the meeting. The Havana
      Charter, and with it the ITO, died of neglect in the early fifties after the U.S. Senate and (partially in
      response to the U.S. action) all but two other governments failed to ratify it. Ironically, the coalition that
      killed the ITO in the U.S. included firms and unions with protectionist interests that resembled those of the
      less industrial states.(<a href="#fn0042" id="bck_fn0042">37</a>)
    </p>
<p>
      In his 1949 inaugural address President Truman reversed the U.S. position on aid to Asia and Latin America with
      his "point four" promises of U.S. technical assistance. Point four aid, like Marshall Plan aid, came to
      be conditional as much upon a potential recipient's willingness to accept the American security doctrine as
      upon willingness to accept the American point of view on economics. Given the simultaneous rise of the trade and
      aid issues on the international agenda in the late <a id="page_28"></a>forties, followed by an apparent American
      willingness to consider expanding its aid to poorer countries, aid rather than trade became the more central
      issue of the north-south economic debate in the 1950s. But the death of the ITO was inconclusive. American
      willingness to aid southern nations as part of its anticommunist policy implied no change in American support of
      its free trade principles. And Latin American, Asian, and African acceptance of aid implied no rejection of the
      sort of restrictive trade policies they had hoped the ITO would support.
    </p>
<p>
      The grievances of the anti-free trade forces at Havana did not die, but with the end of an ongoing forum where
      each state had an equal opportunity to express its opinion on trade matters those grievances were removed to the
      debates in the central organs of the United Nations, where aid matters could be discussed as well. The IMF and
      World Bank continued to provide opportunities to express grievances, but the narrow specializations of those
      organizations along with their restricted membership and voting rules made them less likely places for the poorer
      countries' protests than the General Assembly. We must turn to the debates in the General Assembly to see how
      Asian, African, and Latin American leaders transformed their grievances about one new international economic
      order into the ideas underlying proposals for another.

<p>
      When the trade issue was placed on the international agenda in 1945, governments that wanted to retain national
      trade regulations were confronted with the problem of explaining the moral basis for their trade restrictions.
      They had to counter the argument that such regulations were unjust in principle. Within the milieu of economic
      ideas in 1945 were at least three possible "principled" justifications for regulating trade. One was
      Keynes's "scientific" principle: If it could be demonstrated, as the Keynesians felt it could, that
      economic efficiency and general welfare would be enhanced by trade regulation, then the principles of rational
      economic policy making would themselves dictate such regulation. The second possible justification required
      invoking traditional ideas of national sovereignty including the the right of sovereign nations to determine
      their own economic policy. The third possible justification could be found in the more complex notion of
      sovereignty found in the United Nations Charter, among other places. One interpretation of the charter allowed
      governments to argue that it was both a right of states to regulate trade and a duty of wealthier states to aid
      poorer ones. Because it justified both the trade and aid arguments that southern nations made they chose this
      <a id="page_29"></a>third principle as the moral basis for the reforms they requested.
    </p>
<p>
      The U.N. Charter barely outlines the economic roles that the organization has acquired since its inception in
      1945. Yet from the earliest meeting of the General Assembly, the charter's preamble and its more extensive
      ninth chapter have provided the sort of moral justification needed by framers of the emerging New International
      Economic Order ideology. In the early years the charter especially appealed to governments with little influence
      in the IMF and World Bank, governments that could not expect the volume of economic aid that was given to western
      Europe. The charter speaks of respecting "equal rights" of nations large and small, of promoting better
      standards of living, full employment, and development. (<a href="#fn0043" id="bck_fn0043">38</a>) Moreover, the ninth chapter gives the responsibility for overseeing the economic
      roles of the U.N. and its specialized agencies, like the IMF and the World Bank, to the General Assembly.(<a href="#fn0044" id="bck_fn0044">39</a>) In the assembly, where all states are equally powerful,
      interested governments could push for economic development programs to be undertaken by all U.N. agencies as well
      as for policies that would encourage international acceptance of the idea that each state has the right to
      regulate its international trade.
    </p>
<p>
      The charter is ambiguous. Its relevant paragraphs could equally be used as moral justification for the postwar
      economic regimes as they had been developed by 1947. The duty of nations to cooperate to improve standards of
      living could be considered a mandate for the cooperation needed to reduce trade barriers. The equal economic
      rights of states might be understood as their equal rights to join and receive the benefits of the IMP, World
      Bank, and GATT as well as the more specific rights to expect reciprocity and equal treatment in tariff reductions
      that the GATT was meant to assure.
    </p>
<p>
      Governments supporting trade regulations would never come to interpret the charter's economic principles in
      that way. From the earliest negotiations on the formation of the United Nations, eastern European socialist
      governments as well as most of those from the later-to-emerge third world took the charter to grant U.N. members
      the rights to choose both a domestic system of ownership and control of property and an international orientation
      of their economy, the right to choose either a more open or more closed system. Understood in this way, the
      economic rights of national governments precluded the creation of a universal free trade and free enterprise
      system so long as any state, for whatever reason, supported a more closed or planned economy. Under this
      interpretation, the charter's sections about the duties of states could not be understood as duties to
      support the postwar regimes extant in the late 1940s. U.N. members who opposed the postwar order had to give
      those <a id="page_30"></a>sections of the charter new meaning.
    </p>
<p>
      In its simplest form, the interpretation third world (but not eastern European) opponents came to accept demanded
      that every state aid the economic development of every other state to the best of its ability and with the
      relative needs of all states in mind. The south understood the equal rights of states as giving each government
      the right to choose its own development path, while believing material support of every nation's particular
      development program to be an international matter.
    </p>
<p>
      This principle might be summarized as, "from each state according to its ability, to each state according to
      its need" in order to emphasize two things about the ethic the south developed from the U.N. Charter: (1) It
      concerned states rather than individuals or corporations as the moral agents of international economic relations,
      and (2) it implied aid should be awarded on the basis of need, to the extent that donors could provide it, not on
      the basis of mutual interest or out of charity.
    </p>
<p>
      This Utopian principle, the ethic for a sort of global communism of nations, had a short practical life in the
      mid-1940s as the principle governing the policies of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration
      (UNRRA), especially when it was directed by former New York Mayor Fiorello La Guardia. Because La Guardia was the
      first person to argue within the U.N. for the principles that would come to underlie southern demands for
      reformed international economic relations throughout the three decades following UNRRA's dismantling, his
      views are worth discussing in some detail.
    </p>
<p>
      La Guardia spoke before the Second (Economic) Committee at the first meeting of the General Assembly in the fall
      of 1946. He had directed UNRAA for less than a year but the organization was not much older. The U.S. had created
      UNRRA during the war to provide food and other needed goods to areas liberated from the Axis powers.
      Contributions from noncombatant "United Nations," the wartime allies, served to ease the economic
      burden of the war on the United States and firm up the commitment of the noncombatant states to the Allied
      effort. Latin America donated a politically significant part of UNRRA's resources.(<a href="#fn0045" id="bck_fn0045">40</a>) Controversy marked La Guardia's short tenure at UNRRA. He wanted to
      assure that relief operations would continue at a time when they were becoming burdensome to American policy
      makers. He displeased Washington with his policy of political blindness in distributing aid. La Guardia refused
      to use UNRRA to punish advances by communist parties in eastern Europe. When he testified before the Second
      Committee he took part in a lively debate with the U.S. representative, Adlai Stevenson, about principles that
      should govern the postwar economic order.
    </p>
<p>
      La Guardia came to the General Assembly to advocate <a id="page_31"></a>the creation of international agencies to
      continue UNRRA's work after it ceased operation in 1947.(<a href="#fn0046" id="bck_fn0046">41</a>) He wanted those ongoing organizations to be guided by what he believed were
      UNRRA<sup>1</sup> s principles. Those included a view of nations as collections of individuals
      sharing culturally distinct means of meeting common human economic needs. While people might consent out of
      conviction, indifference, or fear to different sorts of governments, a nation's form of government (and its
      sort of economic policies) could be ignored when evaluating the extent of its economic needs. To do otherwise,
      for La Guardia, would be to violate the U.N. Charter.(<a href="#fn0047" id="bck_fn0047">42</a>)
    </p>
<p>
      In 1946 La Guardia saw the world's greatest economic needs in central Europe where many people actually
      starved or had no shelter. As soon as international efforts had met those needs, other jobs would become more
      important. La Guardia felt international organizations should then begin to focus on regions of the world where
      the next most crucial human needs existed, the war-devastated areas outside Europe. Even after these areas were
      rebuilt, international aid would still be needed. La Guardia called the next most crucial needs the ones for
      "public works projects and industrialization" in what in those days were called "backward"
      nations.(<a href="#fn0048" id="bck_fn0048">43</a>)
    </p>
<p>
      La Guardia felt this ongoing system of international aid should always be financed by the more advantaged
      nations. Given the deep poverty of many in Europe in 1946, it struck him as appropriate that UNRRA's funds
      came from all other parts of the world, including from the Latin American states which he noted gave especially
      generously relative to their wealth. In the future La Guardia hoped that those nations themselves would be
      recipients of aid. He hoped that other U.N. agencies governed by these principles would be created, a
      children's fund and a basic relief agency.(<a href="#fn0049" id="bck_fn0049">44</a>)
    </p>
<p>
      Stevenson adamantly rejected La Guardia's proposals on two grounds. "The U.S.," the official U.N.
      summary of his speech says, "could not participate in a plan based on a principle of mandatory
      allocation," like the one UNRRA was suppose to have followed. The U.S. rejected the idea that every state
      owes something to the economic development of all less advantaged states. Moreover, the U.S. rejected the idea
      that any aid it happened to offer — out of charity or in line with national interests should be allocated by a
      multilateral agency on the basis of that agency's judgement of "need." According to Stevenson, for
      efficiency's sake alone donor nations had the right to expect political and economic conditions to be met by
      recipients of aid. "Delays and inequitable distribution" would result from international management of
      aid because governments with no material interest in the productive use of funds, governments other than the
      donor and recipient, would have influence over transactions.(<a href="#fn0050" id="bck_fn0050">45</a>)
    </p>
<p>
<a id="page_32"></a>La Guardia argued that Stevenson's rejection reflected a selfish American desire to limit
      its aid commitments in hopes that it could get political advantages from doing what was only its duty:
    </p>
<p>
      If the U.S. is a country of great resources it should be remembered that God made its citizens trustees of His
      bounty. Citizens of the U.S. are naturally generous and would disapprove of any plan requiring a country to
      humiliate itself in return for assistance.(<a href="#fn0051" id="bck_fn0051">46</a>)
    </p>
<p>
      La Guardia's notion of the ethic that should guide international assistance never became a guide for American
      aid policy nor did many American citizens ever complain about the strings attached to American aid promises.
      Observers at the time did credit La Guardia with convincing U.N. delegates to approve of UNICEF,(<a href="#fn0052" id="bck_fn0052">47</a>) but UNRRA itself was disbanded and not replaced by another
      U.N. agency with the same operational ideology. And even though the World Bank began to lend money to less
      developed countries at the time La Guardia had suggested it would become appropriate, after the critical poverty
      in the war torn countries had been allieviated, the bank adopted criteria other than "need" for
      allocating its resources.
    </p>
<p>
      The significance of La Guardia's testimony comes from the way leaders with objections to the postwar regimes
      adopted UNRRA's ethic to justify their grievances. La Guardia had outlined a moral justification for
      multilateral economic aid programs which Asian and Latin American officials then joined to traditional notions of
      sovereignty to create a summary of the basic economic rights and duties of states. They linked that ethic through
      the UNRRA precedent to the U.N. Charter. The precedent also let them argue that the powerful nations had once
      accepted the new ethic as legitmate, at least when UNRRA and the U.N. were created. The ethic sanctioned both
      national regulation of trade -- as a reflection of sovereign economic rights — and demands for economic aid to
      the third world that would have no political or economic conditions.
    </p>
<p>
      As early as 1946 southern spokesman justified the reforms they wanted with this ethic. They used their principle
      the same way American free trade advocates used theirs. The new interpretation of the economic rights and duties
      of states validated only one set of policies designed to achieve the internationally agreed upon goal of
      increasing production while precluding others on moral grounds. Southern spokesmen first used their view to
      justify U.N. technical assistance programs to "backward countries;" then to explain why it was right to
      create U.N. economic commissions for Latin America, Asia, and the Middle East; and finally to argue for the
      creation of <a id="page_33"></a>a Special United Nations Fund for Economic Development (SUNFED), all before 1960.
    </p>
<p>
      There is a certain neatness in these principles, at least for governments that want international approval for
      their trade regulations as well as international support for their development programs. If, in the late 1940s,
      the governments that had both of these interests had adopted either of the two other available sets of
      principles, their interests would not have been as well served.
    </p>
<p>
      Keynes's principle that international economic relations should be governed by policies chosen on their
      economic merits alone would have demanded that national development programs be subject to international
      monitoring and evaluation. The south's proposed economic rights and duties of states gave national
      governments primary jurisdiction in deciding development goals and evaluating the success of their own
      development plans. Keynes's principles might have forced some national governments to adopt economic
      development programs which destroyed their indigenous cultural bases of support in the name of economic
      efficiency, something no government would knowingly do. By referring to the economic rights and duties of states,
      the government of a country that received aid could protect any traditional national social institution from the
      impact of foreign aid, whether that institution be as irrelevant to economic efficiency as local habits of dress
      or as significant as the power structure traditionally supporting the government.
    </p>
<p>
      References to older notions of national sovereignty could have justified southern refusal to accept conditional
      international aid, but older views would not have justified the southern premise that aid should be forthcoming
      in the first place. The UNRRA precedent, and La Guardia's view of the UNRRA and U.N. Charter principles,
      provided that premise.
    </p>
<p>
      It would be incorrect to assume that the support "backward" nations gave to UNRRA interpretations of
      the rights and duties of states was merely "ideological" in the pejorative sense of the term. Certainly
      their shared interests "ideologically" constrained their choice among available principles. The less
      industrialized nations could have chosen no other available principles as long as they wanted to maintain their
      old interest in using some trade restrictions and still pursue their new interest in exploiting the opportunities
      available in an international system in which, for the first time, most nations accepted that it was a duty of
      wealthier states to aid at least some types of poorer states. Acceptance of their principles would mean that,
      after European reconstruction, the "backward" states would be the only rightful recipients of material
      aid; nevertheless, nothing the less industrialized states did at the time <a id="page_34"></a>suggests that they
      masked any other purposes when they adopted their principles, nor do any of their actions suggest that they
      adopted these principles without sincerity.
    </p>
<p>
      In assessing southern motives we must remember that in 1946 the distinctions between rich and poor nations, as
      well as the equation of the absence of poverty and the presence of wealth with economic development that we
      commonly accept today, were not so clear. When the Brazilian delegate rose during the first year's debate in
      the Second Committee to propose a U.N. technical assistance program to Latin America and Asia for the first time,
      he represented a country that had given 1 percent of its previous year's production to European recovery, a
      country that due to its overall wealth and in spite of the poverty of most of its people and its
      "backwardness" (lack of industry) Cordell Hull had wanted to make a permanent member of the Security
      Council. (<a href="#fn0053" id="bck_fn0053">48</a>) When the Mexican delegate proposed the
      establishment of a U.N. economic commission for Latin America, modeled on one already in the works for Europe,
      and justified financing his proposal out of general revenues on the basis of U.N. Charter duties of states to aid
      other states in developing economic plans, he represented a country that, like many other Latin American
      countries, had given around .3 percent of its income to the poor in Europe during the previous year.(<a href="#fn0054" id="bck_fn0054">49</a>) India's general proposals for international
      cooperation to assure worldwide industrialization, raised the next year, were championed by a representative who
      had reason to believe that his country's use of sterling as national reserve, rather than some stronger
      medium, represented a major sacrifice to aid British recovery, especially after British postwar devaluations had
      cut India's reserves almost in half.(<a href="#fn0055" id="bck_fn0055">50</a>) In the
      earliest years of the United Nations, the governments that said that all nations had duties to aid the economic
      development of poorer nations could point to their own example of adherence to that principle.
    </p>
<p>
      In the late forties and throughout the fifties the south employed their new principles the most persistently when
      arguing for the Special United Nations Fund for Economic Development. In 1949 India's V. K. R. V. Rao
      submitted an outline of such a fund to a U.N. commission he then headed. Little more was done with the proposal
      that year.(<a href="#fn0056" id="bck_fn0056">51</a>) While nothing was heard about it on the
      floor of the General Assembly, Lebanon's George Hakim spoke extensively about a similar proposal to the
      Second Committee.(<a href="#fn0057" id="bck_fn0057">52</a>) He outlined the need for the fund
      in terms of the limitations of the World Bank. The bank, as originally constituted, had to give assistance to
      projects that would have predictable, direct economic returns; the institutions was, after all, a bank. It loaned
      money and expected repayment with interest. The <a id="page_35"></a>bank did not have money for infrastructure
      projects building roads and ports, for example -- that, in themselves, would not provide returns. In its early
      years the bank rarely provided funds for what La Guardia had called the "public works projects" needed
      in less industrialized countries.
    </p>
<p>
      All the early arguments for SUNFED linked the fund to that need and even to exact language and arguments used to
      support La Guardia's position during the very first meetings of the Second Committee. Hakim's first
      speech paraphrased a speech made by Roberto de Oliveira Campos a year earlier. In that speech the Brazilian
      delegate had mixed praise for existing U.N. technical assistance programs; he considered them worthwhile as the
      "only things the U.N. can do" for less industrialized countries because the World Bank had yet to
      provide significant loans to any of them and because UNRRA had been disbanded.(<a href="#fn0058" id="bck_fn0058">53</a>) Campos's speech, in turn, reiterated the 1946 debate in which the Brazilian
      delegate had first proposed U.N. technical assistance as a program justified by the charter's sections on
      economic development as embodied in UNRRA and in which the Argentine delegate, after noting the size of his
      country's contribution to European recovery, had proposed that making UNRRA a permanent international
      organization would be the best way to institutionalize the organization's view of evolving development
      needs.(<a href="#fn0059" id="bck_fn0059">54</a>)
    </p>
<p>
      Rao's and Hakim's proposals, and all the subsequent southern proposals based on them, were opposed by
      most developed states for years. In the end the U.N. institutionalized them only in part, through the creation of
      a small Special Fund that the U.S. proposed as a compromise.(<a href="#fn0060" id="bck_fn0060">55</a>) In addition the World Bank created a facility which would provide loans to
      infrastructure projects in countries with little industry, the International Development Association
      (IDA).(<a href="#fn0061" id="bck_fn0061">56</a>)
    </p>
<p>
      Two days after Hakim made his proposal in 1949, his colleague from Turkey proposed another type of international
      capital assistance, the provision of funds to private corporations through a World Bank International Finance
      Corporation (IFC) to encourage foreign investment in poorer nations. The IFC could be more easily reconciled to
      the dominant ideology's concerns with private enterprise than could SUNFED, so it was adopted much more
      quickly and completely. Nonetheless, despite the fact that the IFC could have been justified under the dominant
      ideology, the delegate who first proposed it to the Second Committee did just what Hakim had done. He pointed to
      the precedent of U.N. technical assistance and to the aid duties suggested in the southern view of the U.N.
      Charter. Ultimately, the Turkish representative linked the duty of wealthy states to provide the funds through
      which the IFC would insure private investment to responsibilities incumbent upon the rich just because of <a id="page_36"></a>their wealth. For him aid was "not charity" but an affirmation of the unity of
      mankind.(<a href="#fn0062" id="bck_fn0062">57</a>)
    </p>
<p>
      In the early fifties the south also combined the suggestion that resource owners had a duty to use their
      resources for the good of all with the issues of foreign investment in another way to create the most
      controversial application of their principles that they made before 1960. Wealthy market states firmly rejected
      this application even though it implied that poorer states had economic duties that most had never before
      conceded.
    </p>
<p>
      This controversial application first appeared in 1952 during the debates over the Universal Declaration of Human
      Rights. The Chilean representative, applying the south's new principles, proposed that states had the right
      of sovereignty over their natural resources. (<a href="#fn0063" id="bck_fn0063">58</a>) DMC
      delegates correctly interpreted this statement as implying that governments had the right to set the level of
      compensation for property seized from foreign nationals. In that form the notion had a long tradition,
      particularly in relations between the United States and Latin American governments. Latin American lawyers first
      developed the idea specifically as a justification for compensating nationalized American extractive firms at
      levels lower than both the firms and the U.S. government thought fair. Throughout the twentieth century few Latin
      American governments had ever announced exceptions to this principle; even though all quietly accepted levels of
      compensation dictated by international arbitration and foreign governments, they always emphasized they had the
      right not to do so.(<a href="#fn0064" id="bck_fn0064">59</a>)
    </p>
<p>
      Raising the principle of a state's right to control its resources under the broader principles of the
      economic rights and duties of states added a new element, however. Advocates of the principle proposed that while
      a nation had a right to choose how its resources were to be used it also had a duty to choose a way to use those
      resources that would benefit people throughout the world. When southern delegates such as the Chilean
      representative raised this point in the 1950s, DMC representatives considered it to be little more than a
      meaningless rhetorical flourish. Hindsight suggests that wealthy states missed a chance at the beginning of the
      New International Economic Order debate to set guidelines for the responsible use of natural resources that would
      have been useful to the north in the mid-seventies when southern oil owners helped make the NIEO appear new
      again.
    </p>
<p>
      In contrast to the north's failure to call upon the south to consistently recognize the limits on national
      action imposed by their new principles, the less developed states did call upon each other to demonstrate their
      complete adherence to their new principles very early on. Such demonstrations helped to strengthen the very loose
      southern coalition. From the mid-fifties <a id="page_37"></a>onward further development of the emerging ideology
      went hand in hand with new concrete steps toward a formal third world alliance.
    </p>
<p>
      Treaties between India and China in the fifties initiated this trend. Those treaties provided a new, deeper level
      of moral justification for the rights and duties of states the south demanded. Five principles of peaceful
      coexistence framed the first major treaty after the Chinese revolution between the new government and India.
      Nehru would dub these the "<span>Panch</span> <span>Shila</span>"
      following Sukarno's use of this Sanskrit translation of "five principles" to identify the moral
      bases for his government in Indonesia. The two sets of five principles were similar. The international
      <span>Panch</span> <span>Shila</span>, in the most limited interpretation,
      recognize the rights of states to have different economic and political systems. In that sense, an American legal
      scholar correctly identifies them as the old wine of European ideas about the rights of sovereignties placed in
      an eastern bottle with a Sanskrit label.(<a href="#fn0065" id="bck_fn0065">60</a>) But from
      the very beginning those who affirmed the <span>Panch</span> <span>Shila</span> illustrated that that the principles meant much more.
    </p>
<p>
      Asian nations with radically different internal economies first used those principles to frame pledges of mutual
      aid. They said that the minimal duty of states toward one another was mutual noninterference in their internal
      affairs, i.e., mutual acceptance of differences, and that all further cooperation must continue to develop on
      that basis. Ethical international economic aid programs, for example, could only be aimed at assuring the success
      of the unique economic system that the recipient had chosen. And the <span>Panch</span>
<span>Shila</span> affirmed that the path toward international unity was through diversity. In
      the first instance, the <span>Panch</span> <span>Shila</span> justified what,
      to minds schooled in the cold war Ideas of the industrialized states, seems to be an impossible pledge of Indian
      aid to help China develop its radically socialist economy in exchange for helping develop the mixed, but still
      fundamentally capitalist, economy of India.(<a href="#fn0066" id="bck_fn0066">61</a>)
    </p>
<p>
      As subsequent Sino-Indian relations illustrate, it is difficult for states with different national economic
      ideologies and long standing disputes to consistently maintain cooperation under the <span>Panch</span> <span>Shila</span>. But recognition of that fact should not tempt us
      to ignore the political importance of those principles. With inconsequential modifications they have been
      included in all the key agreements among third world countries that became the background for the New
      International Economic Order proposals.(<a href="#fn0067" id="bck_fn0067">62</a>) Those
      agreements never demanded the impossible achievement of complete economic integration between states with
      fundamentally different economic doctrines. Rather, they demanded efforts of good faith aimed at identifying and
      fostering those parts of the <a id="page_38"></a>economic systems within each country that could be uniquely
      developed. Those who affirm the <span>Panch</span> <span>Shila</span> have
      criticized both socialists and liberals, but only those socialists and liberals who seem convinced that such a
      good faith effort across systems is immoral or pointless.
    </p>
<p>
      Respect for cultural differences underlies both the <span>Panch</span> <span>Shila</span> and La Guardia's interpretation of UNRAA and U.N. Charter principles. When Sukarno
      used the Sanskrit words to label principles for Indonesian government he made a similar point quite clear. He
      contrasted "cosmopolitanism" to the "internationalism" expressed by <span>Panch</span> <span>Shila</span>. "Cosmopolitans" believe that
      international cooperation, as well as national integration, develop as differences between people are abolished,
      when people from different cultures come to share the same family customs, economic systems, language,
      philosophy, and government. "Internationalists" hold the view that cooperation develops when
      collaboration aids the unique concerns of each culture.(<a href="#fn0068" id="bck_fn0068">63</a>) Similar distinctions could be made between different views of how to develop
      cooperative social relations in a large multiethnic city, like New York. On the one hand, some say cities should
      serve as melting pots, bringing people from cultures foreign to each other together into a single culture. Others
      argue that cultural diversity strengthens a city and that urban government should foster tolerance of diversity
      and further cooperation building on that tolerance and preserving that diversity. La Guardia, of course,
      advocated the latter view more than the former.(<a href="#fn0069" id="bck_fn0069">64</a>)
    </p>
<p>
      The importance of this view to international economic relations may have little to do with the fact that these
      ideas were developed by leaders of multiethnic communities. Clearly global economic management involves
      collaboration among people from very different cultures, so that an ethic based on recognition of that fact may
      be more relevant than one which ignores cultural diversity. But to guide actual management of the global economy,
      such an ethic would have to be more clearly defined than it was, at least in the early days of the third world
      alliance. It would have to pinpoint those elements of "culture" which are to be tolerated, preserved,
      and strengthened by cooperation. In most multicultural polities, including India, Indonesia, and New York City,
      leaders have simultaneously used both "internationalist" and "cosmopolitan" ethics to justify
      particular parts of the government's program.(<a href="#fn0070" id="bck_fn0070">65</a>)
      The global political importance of the "internationalist" ethic stems from the fact that it provided a
      further level of ethical grounding for the south's view of the economic rights and duties of states. And
      unlike their view of the rights and duties, the south's "internationalism" could be directly
      contrasted with an element of the dominant ideology, the "cosmopolitanism" which serves as a deeper
      level of <a id="page_39"></a>justification for the Bretton Woods system.
    </p>
<p>
      Many social scientists are already familiar with the "internationalist" arguments against Bretton
      Woods. American scholars' frequent "critiques of liberalism" in the 1960s and 1970s focused on the
      same pattern of beliefs that Sukarno called "cosmopolitanism" in the fifties. Robert Packenham in
      <span>Liberal America and the Third World</span> does a particularly good job of illustrating
      the prevalence of those beliefs among scholars and policy makers responsible for U.S. aid programs since
      Truman's Point Four speech.(<a href="#fn0071" id="bck_fn0071">66</a>) But in his critique
      of U.S. foreign policy Garry Wills has probably appropriated the most apt name for the cluster of beliefs,
      "universalism," the conviction that the economic and political goals and policies which have proven to
      be appropriate for one nation — in particular, American economic liberalism — are appropriate for the rest of the
      world. From this universalist point of view, international cooperation builds in stages as more nations accept
      "universal" policies held to be worthwhile for all.(<a href="#fn0072" id="bck_fn0072">67</a>)
    </p>
<p>
      Sukarno and other third world leaders in the fifties did not have the insights of later social scientists to
      guide them when they perceived that "cosmopolitanism" was prevalent and harmful to their interests.
      They did have their instructive experience with the new Bretton Woods system. Taken together, the charters of the
      IMF, World Bank, and GATT affirmed that international cooperation would develop as states accepted the principles
      of limited intergovernmental intervention in the world economy and the goal of free trade. U.S. and World Bank
      policies of excluding many socialist countries from the aid system demonstrated that the emerging global regimes
      were little concerned with cooperation that might be based upon fostering fundamental differences between states.
      Many of the framers of the postwar system refused to tolerate fundamental differences in economic policy. The men
      who most influenced the policies of the emerging system believed that, ". . . free enterprise is, or
      eventually will be, universal."(<a href="#fn0073" id="bck_fn0073">68</a>5 They linked
      this view to the one we have already seen Stevenson express, that bilateral aid was more efficient than
      multilateral aid because the wealth of the donors — their mere ability to give aid — provided prima facie
      evidence that they had discovered effective economic policies. The donors' wealth suggested that any
      restrictions they might place on the use of aid funds would, in fact, make development more efficient. The
      dominant ideology held that there was one best way to develop.
    </p>
<p>
      In a complementary view, throughout the 1950s both the U.S. government and the World Bank explained the
      south's lack of economic development in terms of local "cultural" constraints:
    </p>
<p>
      . . . lack of traditions of political responsi<a id="page_40"></a>bility, weakness of economic initiative . . .
      and insufficient understanding that economic progress requires patience, effort, and self-denial.(<a href="#fn0074" id="bck_fn0074">69</a>)
    </p>
<p>
      While the U.S. government and the bank demanded changes in these "cultural attributes" as preconditions
      for the international cooperation that aid funds represented, third world governments demanded toleration and
      encouragement of many of the same habits the donors wished to abolish. Southern officials, of course, had very
      different names for the same habits referred to in the above quotation from the bank's 1953 <span>Annual</span> <span>Report.</span>
</p>
<p>
      Even earlier evidence of the significance of this univeralist idea can be cited. The apparent U.S. policy of
      encouraging international agreement on the postwar institutions by bringing up the least controversial items
      first also reflected American universalist beliefs: Without recognizing the right of every state to have a
      different sort of economy, the United States encouraged the widest possible agreement among governments only
      because those agreements reflected goals and policies which the American experience had proven to be valuable.
    </p>
<p>
      In refusing to accept the American experience -- or any other model -- as a guide for all economic development,
      third world governments affirmed that a country's economic system should reflect its cultural history and,
      thus, should be part of its unique culture, a culture which not only had a right to exist, but which other states
      had a duty to foster. In addition, third world governments acted as if the only valid interpretation of a
      country's culture was the government's own. This assumption linked third world
      "internationalism" back to the economic rights and duties of states. It suggested another principle,
      maintaining the world's cultural diversity, as a value to be fostered by the global economic system. The
      conflict between "internationalists" affirming the need for cultural diversity, on the one hand, and
      "cosmopolitans" affirming economic policies they held to be universally valid, on the other, became one
      of the deepest, and least discussed, divisions underlying the current north-south conflict.
    </p>
<p>
      The south's increasingly complex moral position did more than help LDC governments understand their conflict
      of interest with the north. It allowed them to create an unusually broad alliance. In a sense, it gave prior
      moral justification for the inevitable disagreements that the members in the vast alliance would have. It
      provided a cooperative way to accept those differences.
    </p>
<p>
      National economic and political ideologies never became a threat to the alliance because the third world's
      moral principles provided a nest of justifications for those differences. When cooperation developed between
      third world states with conflicting national development <a id="page_41"></a>ideologies -- like Keynesian
      liberalism and Leninism — leaders of those countries could pursue their cooperation without cognitive
      inconsistency by referring to the principle that "international cooperation develops on the basis of mutual
      recognition of cultural differences." Conflicting development ideologies just reflected different national
      cultures. When everyone was aware that the actual differences were less "cultural" than ideological,
      the cooperating governments could invoke the "right of states to choose their own development path."
    </p>
<p>
      Those who apply the shared third world ideology the most masterfully, Tanzania's President Julius Nyerere for
      example, also recognize that one deeper justification for "maintaining cultural diversity" is the fact
      that the knowledge embodied in every society is limited. Thus, it is in each society's own interest to
      support the very different plans made by societies that share only some of its goals. The knowledge embodied in
      the foreign culture may turn out to be helpful to you later. Nyerere, once one of his generation's most
      sincere and articulate spokesmen for democratic socialism, has no trouble praising the antisocialist development
      plans of a third world ally like the Ivory Coast or even accepting (at least for a while) the antidemocratic
      political system established by his much closer allies in Zanzibar.(<a href="#fn0075" id="bck_fn0075">70</a>)
    </p>
<p>
      The nest of southern justifications for cooperation between states holding different views is so deep that
      members of the southern alliance have only rarely had to invoke the condescending expedient that most states with
      "universalist" ideologies use to explain why they cooperate with states that ignore their views. Third
      world states rarely have had to argue that their allies' views are "appropriate at this time"
      because of the allies' present (presumably, lower) state of economic or cultural development in the way the
      democratic U.S. sometimes argues for its authoritarian allies' views and the way the socialist Soviet Union
      sometimes argues for its nonsocialist friends' systems.
    </p>
<h2 id="ht0014"><a href="#bck_ht0014">Third World Industrial Development</a></h2>
<p>
      In order to maintain cooperation under their extremely flexible moral framework, Asian, African, and Latin
      American states had to share some fundamental goals. To last as long as it has, southern cooperation had to based
      on something more than the habit that reinforced the southern desire to continue trade restrictions after the war
      or the opportunism that contributed to the first southern calls for international aid. In addition the
      south's basic goals had to be ones that international regimes could be designed to achieve even though the
      Bretton Woods institutions did not accept them.
    </p>
<p>
<a id="page_42"></a>The goals institutionalized by the Bretton Woods regimes in the late forties were simple and
      few: Expanding global trade and production and thus, according to many of the regimes' advocates, removing
      the preconditions for the world wars. Advocates of the earliest proposals for technical assistance to Latin
      American and Asian countries even justified that policy with the argument that the reconstruction of Europe and
      the expansion of world trade desired by all would be quickened if LDC agricultural surpluses could reach port
      more easily; technical assistance in improving internal transportation, they argued, would help expand global
      trade and production.(<a href="#fn0076" id="bck_fn0076">71</a>) But even when they referred to
      expanding global trade and production as reasons for the reforms they proposed, southern spokesman also talked
      about the goal of industrializing the economies of "backward" nations. They discussed that goal more
      frequently and feverently.
    </p>
<p>
      Just as American State Department justifications for free trade rested upon both a moral theory and an economic,
      southern insistence upon internationally supported industrialization had the same dual ideological underpinning.
      The principles of states' economic rights and duties said it was the duty of industrial nations to aid the
      industrialization of any LDC that chose industrialization as its development path, even if that might not be the
      most efficient way to expand global production. In addition, governments supporting industrialization argued that
      it was, in fact, the most effective way to achieve maximum growth.
    </p>
<p>
      Since the free trade theories underlying the postwar system considered specialization rather than
      industrialization to be the most effective development policy conflict over goals between followers of the
      dominant ideology and those who invented the new alternative was inevitable. At the ITO conferences Latin
      American and Asian officials aimed their proposals for restrictive trade practices toward industrialization. To
      American ITO negotiator Clair Wilcox, southern emphasis on industrialization was a "fetish." Even if
      some countries that had not been industrialized before the war did have some sort of comparative advantage in
      producing some industrial lines, only an open world economy would encourage the foreign capital investment that
      would provide the most efficient way to develop that advantage. Such was the lesson of free trade theory.(<a href="#fn0077" id="bck_fn0077">72</a>)
    </p>
<p>
      Unlike Wilcox, some Asians and Latin Americans began their analysis with the Keynesian fear that industrial
      monopolies would choose the conservative, but still profitable, strategy of investing where they had invested
      before in lieu of searching out more profitable investments in the "backward" countries. Others just
      began their analysis with the observation that industrial countries and regions were always richer than
      culturally <a id="page_43"></a>similar regions and nations without industry.
    </p>
<p>
      Nineteen forty-five saw the publication of two major statistical studies highlighting this fact, one by the
      League of Nations, the other by the Oxford statistical institute. The league report advocated industrialization
      in LDCs not for import substitution, as had been the policy in many Latin American states since the 1920s, but to
      raise employment levels and supplement, rather than replace, products imported. The league report suggested that
      if richer countries helped poorer ones industrialize, the poor would have more with which to buy things from the
      rich. Trade would increase.(<a href="#fn0078" id="bck_fn0078">73</a>) The Oxford report
      reached some of the same conclusions. Poor nations had to industrialize in order to abolish disguised rural
      unemployment. A free trade system without special programs to industrialize the "backward" regions
      would just maintain an existing, destructive global division of labor and wealth.(<a href="#fn0079" id="bck_fn0079">74</a>)
    </p>
<p>
      After the U.N. created economic commissions for the developing regions, authoritative analysis praising
      industrialization became commonplace. Developments in economic analysis quickened the international debate. In
      the autumn of 1948, after the Havana conference, Latin American delegates in the General Assembly thanked the new
      international professional staffs for improving the analysis which favored their goal. These staffs had already
      gone beyond the simple correlation that people in industrial nations were richer to work toward an explanation.
      They called underemployment — habitual part time work and inefficiently done work — the cause of underdevelopment
      in the nonindustrial nations. The Oxford study had already said as much. The U.N. added that LDCs specialized in
      high-underemployment, nonindustrial products only as a result of colonialism.(<a href="#fn0080" id="bck_fn0080">75</a>)
    </p>
<p>
      Reports of the Second Committee's annual debate in 1948 demonstrate that as soon as industrialization became
      an openly discussed topic, the ideological split between north and south became obvious. Misunderstanding
      abounded. At one point the Colombian delegate requested that the U.N. investigate why underemployment and low
      wages typified agricultural countries. The American delegate responded that the request was foolish. Low wages
      just implied unproductive labor; no study needed to be undertaken to show that. But the Colombian was searching
      for some other explanation. He probably would have accepted the thesis that industrial techniques themselves
      raised productivity and hence, as further consequence, could help raise wages. He may even have wanted a report
      that actually explained the origins of low wages in poorer countries rather than discussing something correlated
      ("low productivity") or suggesting a cure ("industrialization"). Given that he already
      believed in industrialization as the cure, he probably just wanted his thesis authoritatively affirmed. In <a id="page_44"></a>contrast, the American delegate's immediate thought about "low productivity" could be
      made part of a real (although questionable) explanation for low wages in poorer countries. To understand his
      view, we would need to link it to the American ideas about "cultural impediments" to development that
      were so popular at the time: people in poorer countries received low wages because they did not produce much;
      they did not produce much because their cultures did not value work.(<a href="#fn0081" id="bck_fn0081">76</a>)
    </p>
<p>
      Whether primarily as a result of requests like Colombia's or because of his own research inclination, Raul
      Prebisch of the Economic Commission for Latin America (ECLA) worked throughout 1948 on a study that would offer a
      different explanation.(<a href="#fn0082" id="bck_fn0082">77</a>) Prebisch suggested that the
      global division between a "core" of colonial and former colonial powers engaged in manufacturing, and a
      "periphery" of former colonies and colonies producing primary products be considered analytically
      important. He wanted to explain the low wages and disguised unemployment in the periphery, and he wanted to
      explain why prices of manufactured goods in international trade tended to rise (as he believed they did) and the
      prices of primary commodities remained constant or fell.
    </p>
<p>
      He offered an eminently Keynesian explanation, reflecting his background. It rested upon the powers he assumed
      large firms, unions, and national governments had to enforce decisions based on their parochial interests.
      According to Prebisch, unions and firms in industrial nations had the power to assure that what they received for
      their products could not decline. Production of raw materials involved no global unions. No raw material
      producers acted like monopolies. They competed with each other. Even whole nations dependent on the sale of a
      single commodity usually had many other major competitors. The price they received for their goods could, and did
      at times, go down. Declining LDC terms of trade with rich countries resulted. The decline meant that remuneration
      to the firms and workers producing southern exports could not grow. Moreover, peripheral economies found it hard
      to save money to invest in new enterprises to absorb the labor released from increasingly unprofitable export
      sectors. Industrialization for import substitution, reducing the need to buy increasingly expensive foreign
      goods, could help the problem. And industrialization of any form would help absorb the unused labor in the LDCs.
    </p>
<p>
      Prebisch's analysis later would come under significant attack from all liberal economists, despite his
      Keynesian roots. Frequently critics charge Prebisch with a naive belief that industrialization is a panacea. His
      early work leaves itself open for such criticism. Logically, his analysis points to a need for countervailing
      centers of power in the third world rather than <a id="page_45"></a>an emphasis on industrialization.
      Industrialization was just one of many possible ways to solve that problem of employing the unproductive labor in
      backward countries. Industrialization, in theory, could reduce the dependence of poor countries on products from
      rich countries. But industrialization, in and of itself, would not necessarily increase the relative value of the
      products the south exported.
    </p>
<p>
      Most countries had already chosen industrialization as their first economic goal long before Prebisch published
      his ideas. It is hardly surprising that he would have discussed such policies or that his policy proposals for
      industrialization became the first part of his thesis adopted by third world governments. For a very long time,
      though, southern officials ignored the powers to set prices that firms and unions in industrial countries had.
      Instead, Prebisch's ideas first appeared in intergovernmental debate when LDCs discussed the economic effects
      of the rich countries' cold war "strategic stockpiling" policies.
    </p>
<p>
      Rearmament in the 1950s, while temporarily driving up the prices of raw materials as wealthy states purchased
      goods for their stockpiles, drove up the prices of technologically sophisticated industrial products even faster.
      In 1950, Brazil suggested that rearmament was really being undertaken for economic rather than strategic reasons
      s Rich market countries armed in order to maintain high, wartime levels of employment, a goal the Brazilian
      government felt could just as easily have been met by increasing production in order to help other countries
      industrialize.(<a href="#fn0083" id="bck_fn0083">78</a>)
    </p>
<p>
      Throughout the four following years southern governments became increasingly disturbed over the military
      competition among wealthy states. They forecasted inevitable declines in the prices of raw materials beginning as
      soon as wealthy nations began to sell from their strategic stockpiles. Early on Egypt made the position shared by
      other southern nations clear. Invoking the economic rights and duties of states especially as they apply to those
      who own resources, an Egyptian U.N. delegate said that if rich nations wanted to stockpile goods or sell from
      their stockpiles that was their perogative. But their duties to the other nations made it incumbent upon them to
      also fix the prices of industrial goods through similar government involvement in the market. "An
      equilibrium must be established between the prices of raw materials and the prices of industrial products."
      Commodity agreements and long term contracts could provide that balance.(<a href="#fn0084" id="bck_fn0084">79</a>)
    </p>
<p>
      Cold war competition affected southern views about aid as just a much as about trade. The cold war intensified
      the free market bias of the Bretton Woods institutions and restricted available economic aid. The World Bank
      <span>Annual Report</span> of 1951 used the rearmament of <a id="page_46"></a>"free
      nations" as an explicit reason for demanding that underdeveloped countries increase their production of raw
      materials rather than be concerned with industrialization. The bank, thus, reinforced the specialization argument
      with considerations of strategic politics.(<a href="#fn0085" id="bck_fn0085">80</a>) Of
      course, after Truman's point four speech the World Bank was not the only source of aid funds that the south
      hoped might be used for industrialization. Other nations even joined the U.S. in establishing bilateral programs
      as the cold war intensified. This aid, of course, was designed to achieve strategic objectives. Southern economic
      goals were not always congruent with such objectives. Moreover, in the 1950s wealthy nations frequently diverted
      promised economic aid to their own or their recipient's military purposes in order to achieve the higher
      goals at stake in the cold war.
    </p>
<p>
      India's powerful foreign minister in the 1950s, Krishna Menon, explains that African and Asian governments
      called the 1955 Bandung conference in order to share such frustrations with aid programs linked to strategic
      objectives.(<a href="#fn0086" id="bck_fn0086">81</a>) The conference adopted the <span>Panch</span> <span>Shi</span>la as guidelines for future Afro-Asian relations and
      argued for the entire range of economic reforms that other southern forums had discussed since the war. At the
      time of the Bandung conference northern writers began to use the term "third world" to describe these
      nations that were determined to stay out of the cold war competition.(<a href="#fn0087" id="bck_fn0087">82</a>) The name stuck. Along with the <span>Panch Shila</span>, the idea
      of the "third world" defined the new alliance outside the cold war as a set of nations whose economies
      should be aided by the international community, yet from whom no state should demand political concessions.
    </p>
<p>
      Meanwhile, within the General Assembly the same nations' frustrated interest in creating an international aid
      system not linked to the wealthy states' security goals focused debate on reforms that involved much more
      than changing language. Third world officials continued to say that multilateral aid was preferable to bilateral
      aid because multilateral institutions would be less likely to try to serve both economic and strategic goals with
      the same policy.
    </p>
<p>
      Of course, wealthy nations never made support of their cold war positions the only criteria for granting aid,
      even in the 1950s. They also based their policies on economic analysis designed to identify optimal growth
      policies. Not surprisingly, the analysis preferred by the poorer recipients and the wealthiest donors continued
      to differ throughout the decade. But in the fifties, when the science of development economics was in its
      infancy, north-south disagreements were less dramatic than the rhetoric of the the 1980s might make us think. In
      fact, through the decade the views of poor aid recipients and rich donors began to converge. Even the U.S.
      government <a id="page_47"></a>demoted "specialization" from the central position in its growth
      doctrine. The U.S. began to talk about the more central roles of foreign investment and technical assistance.
      Third world analysis remained distinct from that preferred by most donors in only two ways: The third world saw
      colonialism as the source of their underdevelopment and always saw industrialization as part of the cure.
      Nevertheless, in the 1950s aid donors and recipients shared the same discourse about hypothetical ways to
      eradicate underdevelopment.
    </p>
<p>
      What assured that development economists as different as (say) a laissez faire advisor to the U.S. government and
      a Soviet-trained planner would share common ground was the fact that there usually existed a developing country
      trying to follow a development plan influenced by both of their theories. Three examples illustrate both the
      unity and the diversity within the early "development" discourse.
    </p>
<p>
      First, in the early 1950s the Indian government requested that British Marxist Maurice Dobb report to them on the
      Soviet experience with central planning. Then the Indians grafted central planning upon their essentially
      capitalistic development program.(<a href="#fn0088" id="bck_fn0088">83</a>)
    </p>
<p>
      In a second example, many Latin American nations continued to follow import substitution policies, condemning the
      powers of foreign extractive enterprises and promoting more equal income distribution with land reforms in the
      countryside while allowing individuals in that part of the industrial sector controlled by nationals to
      accumulate vast wealth. Paradoxically, the property-protecting, free enterprise Americans encouraged land
      redistribution in Latin America and in other parts of the third world.(<a href="#fn0089" id="bck_fn0089">84</a>)
    </p>
<p>
      Finally, from the time of the first major public discussion of his development ideas Caribbean economist W.
      Arthur Lewis had a major impact on development planning, especially in Africa. He called for foreign investment
      and expropriation of the surpluses generated by farmers, all in order to assure industrialization.(<a href="#fn0090" id="bck_fn0090">85</a>)
    </p>
<p>
      Needless to say, none of these would easily fit into the categories created by the "free enterprise"
      versus "planning" dicotomy. And the only elements these doctrines clearly share are their emphasis on
      industrialization and their compatibility with an actively managed international economic system dedicated to the
      extended principles of states' economic rights and duties.
    </p>
<p>
      In addition to the unity and diversity of third world development plans, one other factor unified early
      development economics: Much of it was invented within the United Nations. While economists working within the
      U.N. all shared an interest in identifying how international programs could aid third world development, the
      diversity of approaches advocated outside international organizations was replicated within. For example, while
      <a id="page_48"></a>Gunnar Myrdal of the Economic Commission for Europe shared Prebisch's interest in
      "structures" that could be historically linked to colonialism and which continued to impede
      development, he wrote about things like poor education, health, and transportation systems and domestic income
      inequalities rather than speaking of the unequal distribution around the globe of power over prices. (<a href="#fn0091" id="bck_fn0091">86</a>) Myrdal pointed to a need for international aid programs
      like SUNFED. He did not point to a specific need for international pricing agreements. In contrast, W. W. Rostow,
      who also was connected with the European Commission when he wrote his first book on economic growth, linked poor
      education, transportation, and economic systems to "cultural impediments to development" — opposition
      to science (including liberal economic science), technology, innovation, individual initiative, and even sexual
      sublimation.(<a href="#fn0092" id="bck_fn0092">87</a>)
    </p>
<p>
      No NIEO advocates of the 1980s consider Rostow one of the U.N. economists of the fifties who influenced the
      emergence of the new order position, with good reason. Third world officials ignored Rostow's views from the
      beginning because they rested on an explanation of underdevelopment which challenged the principles underlying
      the southern position. Rostow embodied American universalism. His arguments about cultural impediments to
      development implied that there was only one way to develop. While third world states shared one development goal
      — industrialization — throughout the fifties, they continued to affirm that many paths led to that end.
    </p>
<h2 id="ht0015"><a href="#bck_ht0015">Completing Bretton Woods and Moving on to
    Development</a></h2>
<p>
      The effects of Rostow's views, nonetheless, exemplify the convergence between north and south that took place
      during the fifties. Views like Rostow's helped convince northern governments at the end of the decade to turn
      from the problems of creating the postwar system to the problems of providing the infrastructure for third world
      development. In the late fifties the north turned away from its own problems, which had triggered interest in
      creating the postwar system in the first place, to some of the third world problems that the postwar system had
      ignored from the beginning.
    </p>
<p>
      Histories of the Bretton Woods institutions rarely mention the third world concerns, such as creating the
      infrastructure for industrial development, when considering the fifties. Third world issues did not have to be
      resolved in order for the IMF, World Bank, and GATT to become fully operational.
    </p>
<p>
      In the fifties only two things kept the World Bank from operating as it was supposed to, as the world's most
      significant source of funds for development. First, the unexpectedly high cost of European reconstruction had
      <a id="page_49"></a>been borne outside the bank through the Marshall Plan. The bank only became significant in
      its own right as it accumulated capital from its members' annual contributions, which grew as western
      economies grew. Second, the bank needed to develop its own rationale for granting loans, its operational
      ideology.
    </p>
<p>
      Even while constrained by the fact that its loans had to be made for profitable projects, during the fifties the
      World Bank developed the ability to fund programs influenced by almost the entire spectrum of opinions on how
      economic growth could be triggered. Nonetheless, the bank continued to encourage potential borrowers to be open
      to foreign investment, to support liberal trade policies, and even to support the strategic interests of the
      DMCs. Yet, even while warning against "premature industrialization," the bank moved toward accepting
      industrialization as a central part of any development program.
    </p>
<p>
      Throughout the fifties the bank funded industrial infrastructure and industrial development projects because
      those were the sorts of projects designed by the states whose wealth and (relatively) liberal development
      doctrines appeared to promise that they would be able to repay loans, states like Australia, Italy, Japan, and
      the Nordic countries.(<a href="#fn0093" id="bck_fn0093">88</a>) Somewhat unconsciously the
      World Bank developed a "public works" approach that it found hard to extend to the poorer states not
      recognized by the international financial community as good credit risks. Yet, by the end of the decade the bank
      wanted to do just that. By 1958 the bank had commissioned a study of the debt-servicing problems experienced by
      those poorer states that had tried to finance infrastructure projects with short term loans. As the decade
      closed, the bank began to solve the problem. It opened the IDA, the long term, low interest loan facility
      championed by the U.S. in lieu of SUNFED. (<a href="#fn0094" id="bck_fn0094">89</a>) When it
      began to operate the way its founder's intended, the World Bank became, in part, the supporter of public
      works projects and industrialization in the "backward" countries that many who took part in the first
      U.N. debates had hoped it would become.
    </p>
<p>
      Unlike the World Bank, the IMF and GATT experienced more sudden breaks in their development. Those clear breaks
      assured that influential northern officials would have the opportunity to completely shift their attention from
      one set of global economic problems to another. That opportunity, in turn, made it possible for northern
      officials to focus on, and give some support to, the sorts of development policies the bank had come to back.
    </p>
<p>
      The IMF could only start working normally when most of its members had agreed to let their currencies be freely
      exchanged. Buttressed by their growth in the 1950s and relying, ultimately, on an American promise to convert
      dollars into gold at a fixed rate, most western European nations agreed to make their currencies <a id="page_50"></a>convertible at fixed rates in December of 1958. They removed their national exchange restrictions
      and agreed to live within the IMP rules, to maintain balanced payments and support the relative values of their
      currencies through short term borrowing and economic policies monitored by the IMF.(<a href="#fn0095" id="bck_fn0095">90</a>)
    </p>
<p>
      The GATT required more than the relative stability and growth of the European economies before it could become
      fully operational. The GATT's only enforcement mechanisms involved requiring each of the contracting parties
      to justify both specific trade restrictions and their trade policy as a whole to the entire membership. The
      membership could then approve or withhold approval of specific restrictions. Prior to 1959 the GATT only heard
      cases involving specific restrictions, without evaluating whole national policies.(<a href="#fn0096" id="bck_fn0096">91</a>)
    </p>
<p>
      Those precedent setting cases reflected the pragmatic attitude taken by most members. They usually placated the
      wealthier of two parties in a trade dispute. More nations benefited from a wealthy nation's low tariffs than
      from the low tariffs of a poor nation, and the GATT's weak enforcement mechanisms could not induce nations
      with diversified economies to comply. GATT members could only remove trade preferences already granted. For
      example, GATT ruled in favor of the U.S. in a dispute with Czechoslovakia in 1951, establishing the precedent
      that trade restrictions were justified for reasons of national security. In approving the European Coal and Steel
      Community in 1951 and in accepting that West Germany could protect its agricultural sector in 1954, the GATT
      appeared to accept a principle that regional economic development plans provided reason enough for trade
      restrictions — a principle that could be justified under the emerging new order ideology, but not under the
      ideology that designers of the postwar system shared. Nonetheless, in the fifties, the GATT granted few
      exceptions to third world countries who claimed them to be justified by development principles. Third world
      delegates, who remained a minority throughout the decade, often commented on this apparent double
      standard.(<a href="#fn0097" id="bck_fn0097">92</a>)
    </p>
<p>
      Despite their complaints, third world memoers of GATT did not withdraw. Some changes in the organization through
      the decade clearly helped poorer countries. In particular, the GATT amended its rules in 1956 so that states
      whose exports competed with one another could still demand negotiations to reduce import duties on the product.
      (<a href="#fn0098" id="bck_fn0098">93</a>) An even more significant, although inadvertent,
      concession to third world interests came in 1955 after it had become abundantly clear that the ITO would never be
      formed. The chief author of the report, free trade theorist Gottfried Haberler, noted that the GATT had not
      promoted fully free trade. He condemned quantitative restrictions on third world agricultural products <a id="page_51"></a>imposed by DMCs in lieu of the tariffs they had reduced under the GATT.(<a href="#fn0099" id="bck_fn0099">94</a>) When the report was adopted in 1958, at the same time the GATT became fully
      operational by adopting its procedures to review each member's complete trade policy, it appeared to promise
      increasing north-south cooperation.
    </p>
<p>
      Other equally positive portents for north-south cooperation appeared at the end of the fifties. Colonialism
      rapidly ended in all but a few nations; the practice that third world governments had identified as the cause of
      underdevelopment started to disappear. Prosperous European nations; who saw the convertibility of their
      currencies as a rite of passage into the membership in economic system on the same level as the United States,
      took up the call for the economic development of the poorer states. Another sign of that new equality was the
      abolition of the international organization which had coordinated European recovery and the creation of a
      successor organization, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), that would include
      European nations and the U.S. as members with equal rights and responsibilities. In 1959 the Economist
      editorialized that the OECD should become something more than a symbol of the wealthy nations' new equality;
      it should become a real aid agency in recognition of the fact that the problems which led to the creation of the
      postwar economic institutions had been solved and that now, "the biggest fissure in the world at the moment
      is between rich and poor." To encourage debate on ways to meet the challenge, the Economist closed the
      fifties by serializing W. W. Rostow" s new Stages of Growth.(<a href="#fn0100" id="bck_fn0100">95</a>)
    </p>
<p>
      Other, less visible, portents contradicted the signs of increasing north-south cooperation perceived and
      reinforced by the <span>Economist</span> in 1959. We now can see that the maturation of the
      Bretton Woods institutions just signaled the end both of the first phase in the development of the south's
      new ideology and of the first phase in the postwar north-south conflict.
    </p>
<p>
      In one sense, Rostow's highly touted work (which became increasingly significant when he entered the American
      government with the Kennedy administration two years later) represented a significant concession to third world
      interests. Its call for aid and its implicit approval of industrialization rather than unending specialization in
      nonindustrial products reflected a significant shift in northern attitudes since the forties. Likewise, the
      reforms in the Bretton Woods system engineered in the fifties — the IDA and IFC, and the new GATT rules -- along
      with the U.N.'s own development programs, equally conceded part of the third world opinion.
    </p>
<p>
      But official opinion in the third world had long since transformed what started as a simple interest in <a id="page_52"></a>industrialization and in using traditional trade policies toward that end into something much more
      complex. Before 1960 the leaders of the third world had come to identify themselves as those excluded from global
      economic decision making, those whose economic need was the greatest, and those who wanted to create a world
      where the cultural integrity of each nation was the basis for, and fostered by, international economic
      cooperation. New ideologies give new identities. Even before 1960 the seeds of the ΝΙΕ0 ideology defined a new
      international identity for the governments of Asia, Africa, and Latin America.

        involved many noneconomic considerations. It is thus more of an index of "effective power" than any

        claim reciprocal concessions from trading partners. See Kock, p. 63. GATT voting rules follow the one nation
        one vote principle agreed upon for the ITO in 1948, over the objections of the U.S., which wanted explicitly
        weighted voting. See Brown, pp. 145-46. Given the GATT's primary role as a tariff negotiation framework,
        the political principles embodied in its rules for negotiation are more important than those embodied in the
        contracting parties voting rights. The contracting parties cannot change the GATT rules by a majority vote
        because the tariff negotiating rules constitute the contract.

        Woods system for being "universalist" and means by that that the system payed too little attention to
        regional economic differences and that its framers did not consider the possibility of using regional
        organization more than the global, "universal" organization. Essentially, he uses the term to frame
        some Keynesian doubts about the system, suggesting it might not be equally good for everyone. See pp. 381-85
        and his later partial revision, pp. xxi-xxii. Hans Horgenthau also talked about "universalism," the
        "universalism" of twentieth century nationalism. In this century, unlike in the last, nationalism has

    The "New" Ideology in the 1960s</a></h1>
<p>
        [UNCTAD] will show whether the developed countries are capable of discharging the obligations imposed on them
        by their wealth. It will also require them to renounce their traditional policy of passively accepting the
        supremacy of market forces. Against blind respect for those forces and against the trade restrictions imposed
        by the strongest against the weakest ranges the new ideology which inspired the convening of the conference.
        That ideology . . . will constitute a new phase in the age old struggle for the liberation of peoples and
        respect for human dignity.
      </p>
<p>
        — Alphonso Patino of Colombia, 1963
      </p>
<p>
        . . . the developing nations want change. They want a "new" international division of labor. They
        want and have a "new" trade forum. They want "new" trade principles. They want new and
        different techniques of aid, not necessarily at the sacrifice of the old but in addition to what is now being
        done.
      </p>
<p>
        — Sidney Weintraub of the United States, 1964(<a href="#fn0101" id="bck_fn0101">1</a>)
      </p>
<p>
      Even though the decade began with signs that the Bretton Woods system could be reformed in favor of third world
      interests, the sixties were marked by growing economic divisions between north and south. LDCs became more aware
      of how their interests clashed with those of the DMCs. From 1960 through 1965 evidence mounted that poorer
      nations received few of the benefits the liberal system had promised. Developed countries enjoyed most of the
      growth induced by trade. Trade favoritism among already industrialized states continued. Third world leaders saw
      such continuing abuses as proof that the postwar system merely continued prewar relations in a new <a id="page_60"></a>form. The LDCs, united under the ethic and analysis developed since the war, pushed for creation of
      a new international economic system dedicated to that new ideology.
    </p>
<p>
      In the first five years of the decade the ideology itself developed only along the lines already established in
      the 1950s. Third world economic analysis became more complex in response to new issues. Prebisch's framework
      allowed the south to apprehend and explain growing income and trade "gaps" between rich and poor
      nations. Third world governments proposed an array of new policies to increase their share of global trade. They
      suggested specific public aid targets, multicommodity pricing agreements, compensatory financing for trade income
      shortfalls, and special aid for the least developed LDCs (LLDCs), especially the new states in Africa. All of
      these new economic proposals attacked similar problems, consequences of the Bretton Woods system that no one who
      created the system had expected, or that none had expected would have such distressing effects on poorer nations.
    </p>
<p>
      By mid-decade the ideology had begun to change in fundamentally new ways. Adherents had developed a new
      self-awareness and self-confidence. They stopped calling for reforms and started calling for a new economic
      order. They had become aware of the ideology they shared and aware that the ideology outlined a plan for a new
      economic system. They knew that plan was not complete; for example, the ellipsis in Patino's comment stands
      in place of a long remark that the ideology had to be specified further. In the sixties, for the first time,
      third world officials began to pursue the development of their ideology consciously.
    </p>
<p>
      In the middle of the decade the ideology's adherents developed a specific political identity as the Group of
      77. The agreement on a formal political identity triggered the alliance's development of its first political
      theory, explicit views about strategy and tactics which had not been part of the third world's shared
      position before. The southern allies insisted on using what they called "democratic means" to achieve
      their ends. They understood such means to include majority or consensual rule by national governments voting as
      equals, as well as the use of persuasion to influence legislative and public opinion in the wealthy states.
    </p>
<p>
      Later, third world leaders would learn from the failure of this initial strategy. As a result of their failures
      in the sixties, they would know how to exploit the DMCs' economic vulnerabilities in the early 1970s when the
      Bretton Woods system began to create problems even its key members felt.
    </p>
<p>
      In the 1960s, however, not only had the LDCs not yet agreed upon the political strategies needed to exploit
      <a id="page_61"></a>the vulnerabilities that would appear when the Bretton Woods system started to break down;
      there were few hints that such a breakdown would ever occur. The system was in its heyday. It was brilliantly
      achieving the goals its founders had set for it. The cover of the GATT<sup>'</sup>s 1966 annual
      report makes the point well with its graphs of indices of international trade and world production from 1956 to
      1966.(<a href="#fn0102" id="bck_fn0102">2</a>) Both rise dramatically, trade volumes leading
      the way for production. The liberal system assured the truly unprecedented global prosperity that marked the
      sixties. For the wealthy market states, unlike for the poorer ones, few unanticipated problems appeared in the
      sixties to make them doubt the viability and value of the system which had spurred the unprecedented growth.
    </p>
<p>
      One unanticipated development in the sixties, indirectly connected to the system's success, created as many
      opportunities for the third world alliance as it did problems. But the new order ideology, as it existed then,
      did not give the alliance the theoretical means of fully resolving the problems while fully exploiting the
      opportunities. The vast increase of new sovereign states provided the alliance with many more members and thus
      increased the political importance of the emerging ideology. But the interests and frustrations of the new states
      differed from those of states that had been independent longer. Some of the new states said that rich nations had
      duties to poor nations because colonizers had historical duties to the colonized. This ethic based on historical
      obligations clashed with earlier third world notions about the permanent rights and duties of states. This
      difference of opinion contributed to the failure of the Group of 77's first political strategy by reducing
      the impact of attempts to present a united front in order to influence opinion in developed countries. This
      disunity, however, left a fortuitous legacy for the south: The unity of the third world behind the New
      International Economic Order in the early seventies caught many in the north by surprise.
    </p>
<p>
      The part of the story of the new order ideology told in this chapter ends before the third world reaffirmed its
      unity. It begins with the trade issues the founders of Bretton Woods failed to anticipate and shows how those
      emergent issues led to the first UNCTAD, the formation of the Group of 77, and the first southern calls for a
      completely "new" economic system. The second section discusses the political analysis the group adopted
      in the latter half of the decade. The third and final section relates how other unanticipated consequences of the
      system, first apparent in the sixties, led to the developments in third world economic policy analysis at the end
      of the decade. It also discusses the differences in third world opinion that then were current, linking them both
      to the different problems experienced by different third world states as a result of the system's <a id="page_62"></a>operation and to the incomplete incorporation of the newest states into the alliance.

      As would be expected of the international organization most concerned with trade matters, the GATT was the first
      institution to make the international community aware of trade related global income "gaps." It did so
      in 1960 by suggesting explanations for problems others had previously identified but not explained. In 1958 Nehru
      had used postwar national income statistics to demonstrate a widening income gap between rich and poor
      nations.(<a href="#fn0103" id="bck_fn0103">3</a>) By 1959 it had become commonplace for some
      news magazines in worldwide circulation to identify the north-south division of the globe as more critical than
      the east-west division. (<a href="#fn0104" id="bck_fn0104">4</a>) Nonetheless, in the late
      fifties, when aid rather than trade issues still dominated the north-south agenda, officials and commentators
      rarely correlated the increasingly apparent income gap with recent developments in international trade. Of
      course, throughout the fifties third world leaders recognized that higher returns from trade could increase their
      national wealth; that is why they proposed some new trade policies, then compensatory financing for trade
      shortfalls, and finally even resurrection of the entire ITO.(<a href="#fn0105" id="bck_fn0105">5</a>) But actual figures on the third world's declining proportion of both world trade
      and world income first became available in 1960 through a report circulated by the GATT.(<a href="#fn0106" id="bck_fn0106">6</a>) The highly correlated figures suggested that the third world's
      declining proportion of world trade caused its declining proportion of world income.
    </p>
<p>
      GATT did not draw the causal connection from the related trends. But third world leaders increasingly did draw
      that connection by following, in part, the Prebisch thesis. Most southern leaders first gave the implications of
      the Prebisch argument serious consideration only when the trade-related income gaps became apparent. Third world
      representatives to the U.N. carefully discussed different ways that nonmarket forces might be keeping the prices
      of DMC manufactured goods relatively high. Some called for establishing countervailing influences on the world
      market in order to keep LDC prices high as well. The poorer oil producing states formed OPEC and justified it to
      the United Nations General Assembly as an institution designed to keep oil prices high. (<a href="#fn0107" id="bck_fn0107">7</a>) (Ironically, they did not succeed in their stated purpose until 1973.)
      In 1960 the Colombian delegate spoke to the General Assembly's economic committee about establishing
      "trade unions" of raw material producers.(<a href="#fn0108" id="bck_fn0108">8</a>)
      As if to capitalize on these developments, in 1961 ECLA republished Prebisch's seminal study.(<a href="#fn0109" id="bck_fn0109">9</a>)
    </p>
<p>
<a id="page_63"></a>Just as in the 1950s when some third world officials used parts of Prebisch's theory to
      understand and respond to trade problems created by cold war stockpiling policies, once again few third world
      officials completely adopted Prebisch's explanation of the trade and income gaps. Instead of focusing
      directly on the powers of the firms and unions in developed nations, most representatives of individual third
      world governments talked about the flaws in the postwar trade system that the Haberler report to the GATT
      outlined. Third world officials saw the relative decline in their income from trade as a reflection of the fact
      that wealthy market states had been able to mold the liberal system to their needs. The trade system, they noted,
      tended to allow DMCs to trade industrial products among themselves freely while forcing LDCs to pay tariffs on
      the same items. And the system allowed the north to erect protectionist barriers to southern imports.(<a href="#fn0110" id="bck_fn0110">10</a>)
    </p>
<p>
      Only when the poorer nations turned to solutions to the apparent trade problems did they line up behind the
      Prebisch thesis rather than Haberler's. The LDCs never called for a return to the GATT' s laissez faire
      principles; instead, the south continued to call for conscious adoption of global trade policies that would
      increase third world income, policies justified by their view of the rights and duties of states. As a Uruguayan
      official put it in 1960, in place of the GATT's "equal treatment" principle, which allowed richer
      nations greater power to influence economic relations than poorer nations (even before special concessions like
      those to the European Community had been made), there should be a principle of "equitable treatment,"
      international policies aimed at fostering the trade relations appropriate to each nation's level of economic
      development and its development goals.(<a href="#fn0111" id="bck_fn0111">11</a>) In
      particular, beginning in 1961 and following a set of proposals made by Africa's newly independent, most
      populous state, Nigeria, the third world demanded a system of generalized tariff preferences for third world
      goods.(<a href="#fn0112" id="bck_fn0112">12</a>)
    </p>
<p>
      This new policy proposal did not fundamentally change the emerging third world economic ideology. Adherents
      simply added the new version of the trade issue and new proposed solution to other policy analyses already in the
      ideology. At the first conference of nonaligned countries in Belgrade in September of 1961 not only did the
      delegates condemn the postwar aid system for the way it linked cold war goals to development goals, they
      condemned the trade system as well. Delegates called on the developed nations to improve the terms of trade for
      LDC goods and to end restrictive trade practices that harmed poorer states.(<a href="#fn0113" id="bck_fn0113">13</a>) At the same time, southern spokesmen in the U.N. reaffirmed their ethic and their
      central economic goal as keys to abolishing the trade and income gaps. As the Bolivian delegate put it,
      "Each <a id="page_64"></a>society has its own needs and its own means to satisfy them. But if the
      underdeveloped countries wish to survive they must industrialize."(<a href="#fn0114" id="bck_fn0114">14</a>)
    </p>
<p>
      By 1961 even the GATT was calling for the industrialization of the third world as one means for dealing with the
      poorer nations' declining share of world trade. In a special study of trade and development for its
      <span>Annual Report</span>, the GATT Secretariat analyzed possible ways to ease the relative
      decline. It found little room for expanding traditional exports and advocated industrialization along the model
      of the Latin American Free Trade Area instead. That model required that national specialization in particular
      industrial lines become an object of intergovernmental cooperation in each of the developing regions. The GATT
      even raised the possibility that intervention to raise the terms of trade for traditional exports might prove
      worthwhile in the short run, although it did not discuss specific ways to accomplish such intervention.(<a href="#fn0115" id="bck_fn0115">15</a>)
    </p>
<p>
      Continuing GATT interest in the declining relative volume of third world trade reflected the fact that liberal
      economists treated the problem as a real dilemma. Most felt that in the long run terms of trade would swing in
      favor of food and raw materials (rather than manufactured goods) under the influence of diminishing returns.
      Because raw materials exist only in limited quantities, they should become scarcer, costlier to extract, and,
      thus, relatively more costly as time goes on.(<a href="#fn0116" id="bck_fn0116">16</a>)
    </p>
<p>
      Liberal economists may still be right, <span>in</span> the long run. But in the 1960s, predictions
      based on facile analysis of the long run availability of raw materials proved wrong. Instead of rising, the value
      of third world raw material exports relative to northern manufactures fell. That fact could be explained (without
      rejecting the liberals' long run conclusions) by pointing to the different manipulations of the world market
      by unequally powerful states. The already rich benefited the most from such manipulations. At least that was the
      conclusion both the GATT and a significantly large group of third world officials accepted. What to do about it
      was another matter.
    </p>
<p>
      Just as the LDCs remained committed to their vision, the GATT Secretariat remained committed to liberal trade.
      The GATT's commitment precluded it from serving as a framework for the sorts of policies third world
      governments preferred to use to combat the trade and income gaps. In the early sixties they began to look for
      other organizational frameworks.
    </p>
<p>
      In 1962 the Cairo Second Afro-Asian Conference called for a United Nations trade conference to provide an
      international forum outside GATT for proposals like commodity pricing agreements, compensatory financing, and a
      generalized system of tariff preferences. The U.N. <a id="page_65"></a>votes of the governments represented at
      the Afro-Asian conference, along with the votes of those Latin American states which had been invited observers
      and of socialist governments who wanted the U.K. conference to deal with ways to expand east-west trade, assured
      that the first United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD I) would be called quickly. The General
      Assembly scheduled the conference for late spring of 1964.(<a href="#fn0117" id="bck_fn0117">17</a>)
    </p>
<p>
      In the months between the Cairo conference and UNCTAD third world frustrations over the effects of the postwar
      economic system coalesced. In addition to the problems of cold war-related aid policies and the GATT's
      obviously inadvertent function as an agency sanctioning DMC protectionist policies, other issues had been
      festering.
    </p>
<p>
      In the third world view, despite the creation of the IDA and the Special Fund, the World Bank and bilateral aid
      donors had consistently exacerbated the gap between rich and poor states by loaning only to the richest of the
      poor.(<a href="#fn0118" id="bck_fn0118">18</a>) The IDA itself remained only a poor
      second-best alternative to SUNFED because the IDA adopted the World Bank's system of voting weighted in
      proportion to wealth, rather than the one nation, one vote system SUNFED would have followed. Dissatisfaction
      with the aid system even convinced the majority in General Assembly to set official targets for aid to third
      world countries, to define one of the duties of the wealthy states throughout the development decade more
      explicitly as the duty to give 1 percent of their GNPs to poorer states, a goal few wealthy states ever reached.
      The UNRRA goal for grants to needy nations, which some poorer states could say that they themselves had
      respected, provide the precedent for the 1 percent figure. Those unusual LDCs that had received significant aid
      since the second world war, such as India, complained about the burden that repaying those debts placed on an
      economy still trying to catch up with the wealthy states, the problem the IDA was supposed to solve.(<a href="#fn0119" id="bck_fn0119">19</a>)
    </p>
<p>
      Even the Bretton Woods monetary system came under third world attack in the months leading up to UNCTAD I.
      According to the south, the wealthy countries controlling the monetary system were the only nations that could
      afford to make their currencies convertible. The major evidence LDCs offered for that assertion was the fact that
      it took nearly a decade and a half of internationally supported postwar economic development before western
      European states wanted to make their money convertible. For those states that could afford them, convertible
      currencies made it easier trade, at least with other countries that had convertible currencies. The fact that
      LDCs could not yet afford convertibility meant that developed countries would be more likely to increase their
      trade with each other than they would be to increase their trade with LDCs. Given the LDCs' views <a id="page_66"></a>about the rights and duties of states, they placed the blame for this situation on the postwar
      monetary system, which had enshrined the principle of convertibility, and not on themselves. The European
      precedent suggested, after all, that poorer nations should not be expected to live up to the monetary rules the
      postwar system demanded.
    </p>
<p>
      Despite this criticism, the postwar monetary system was the object of much less third world scorn in the early
      sixties than either the trade or aid systems. Third world spokesmen even praised the IMF in 1963 for establishing
      a system of short term loans that could be taken out by countries suffering losses in expected income due to
      sudden drops in the prices of commodities they exported. Still, the LDCs chastised the IMF for limiting this
      financing to an amount that would bring export earning up to a longer term trend, a trend that third world
      governments believed was declining for almost any commodity they exported.(<a href="#fn0120" id="bck_fn0120">20</a>)
    </p>
<p>
      In light of these mounting grievances, when the Egyptian delegate began the General Assembly debate on economic
      matters directly after the Second Afro-Asian Conference had ended in Cairo, he summarized a history of
      frustrations going back to the Marshall Plan and UNRRA. He said that significant international systems for aid to
      DMCs, systems which took into account those countries' own definitions of their economic needs, had existed
      for years. Those systems, developed to aid postwar Europe, had never been copied in giving aid to Asian, African,
      and Latin American countries. Most significantly, similar consideration of third world nations' self-defined
      economic needs never took place.(<a href="#fn0121" id="bck_fn0121">21</a>)
    </p>
<p>
      By June of 1963 the nations that would become the Group of 77 had formally outlined their UNCTAD positions
      through a series of regional meetings. At those regional conferences third world leaders turned their
      frustrations with the postwar economic system into a call for "a new international division of labor,"
      a division that would no longer make the third world the world's "hewers of wood and drawers of
      water," the south said, using a Biblical phrase that already had long history in the literature on
      imperialism before 1963.(<a href="#fn0122" id="bck_fn0122">22</a>) The "new international
      division of labor" simply meant that the third world should become industrialized.
    </p>
<p>
      In 1964 this call for a whole new international economic system was no doubt more symbolic than practical. Even
      if they had had the power to create a new economic order, third world governments still did not have the plan.
      The regional third world meetings came up with outlines of a new global system of production no more coherent or
      complete than any of the others the third world had presented since the war. The regional meetings simply
      reiterated the reform proposals that third world states had long supported. The call for a <a id="page_67"></a>"new" world economy was more a way of symbolizing the increasing significance that third
      world governments attached to their proposals in the months before UNCTAD.
    </p>
<p>
      Plans offered in the months before UNCTAD even differed a bit from region to region throughout the third world.
      The Latin American states emphasized that those nations that had benefited the most from the postwar economic
      institutions had the greatest duty to aid other nations. Latin America also placed solutions to debt servicing
      problems in one of the most prominant positions in its plan.(<a href="#fn0123" id="bck_fn0123">23</a>) African states identified former colonies as the most needy states and gave special
      emphasis to calls for tariff preferences to be given to the least advantaged nations. While the Latin American
      resolution mentioned that proposal it placed it lower on the agenda simple because a smaller proportion of the
      Latin American states could be called "least advantaged" by any definition. The Africans also called
      for multi-commodity pricing agreements that would allow funds collected while protecting the ceiling price of one
      commodity (by selling from a buffer stock) to be used to defend the floor price of another commodity.(<a href="#fn0124" id="bck_fn0124">24</a>) This was another policy discovered among the many
      never-enacted suggestions left by Lord Keynes. (<a href="#fn0125" id="bck_fn0125">25</a>)
      Latin American and Asian delegates failed to consider it until the Africans brought it up at the joint meeting of
      the regions prior to UNCTAD.
    </p>
<p>
      Asians, Africans, and Latin Americans easily reconciled the differences in their draft proposals by invoicing the
      principles they had developed in the forties. Both the debt problem, of special interest to the richest LDCs in
      Latin America and Asia, and the problems associated with stabilizing and increasing the prices of the weakest
      commodities traded, issues especially important to Africa, had to be included as issues to be addressed by the
      "new" world economic order. Each problem reflected a major impediment in the development paths
      particular sovereign states had chosen.
    </p>
<p>
      Third world unity behind shared principles increased in the months leading up to the first UNCTAD. Third world
      governments repeatedly emphasized the duty of each state to support the economic development programs chosen by
      other states. Third world spokesmen even asserted that this principle explained part of the value of their new
      ideology. They called the ideology a contribution to global economic development. Echoing Patino, who had made
      the statement at the head of this chapter the week before, a Libyan delegate explained to the General
      Assembly's economic committee in 1963 that third world states had discharged their development duties toward
      others by contributing a new, higher set of moral values to the development debate.(<a href="#fn0126" id="bck_fn0126">26</a>) Along with Patino, the Libyan represented the general opinion of southern
      officials when he stated that the new ideology was an <a id="page_68"></a>historically unique, valuable
      contribution to humanity.
    </p>
<p>
      At the first UNCTAD southern governments acted on the basis of their self-perceived moral leadership to have the
      conference approve their ethic and their analysis of the world economy. Before the meeting Raul Prebisch, who had
      been elevated from ECLA to be Secretary General of the UNCTAD in 1963, provided a new, more extensive gloss of
      his theories and a set of policy recommendations in a report entitled "Toward a New Trade Policy for
      Development." This report became the informal agenda for the conference.(<a href="#fn0127" id="bck_fn0127">27</a>) The conference approved resolutions both restating the report's policy proposals
      and affirming bits of Prebisch's analysis. The resolutions called these proposals and assertions "trade
      principles" that would guide the "new and just world economic order" the conference intended to
      create. (<a href="#fn0128" id="bck_fn0128">28</a>) All these principles had appeared earlier,
      outgrowths of the Havana Charter debates, the <span>Panch Shila</span>, assertions about the
      validity of Prebisch's analysis of trade, and the special demands that each third world region made directly
      before UNCTAD I.
    </p>
<p>
      Many governments rejected the third world's self-proclaimed moral leadership and the principles embodying it,
      but even at the first UNCTAD northern opponents to the south's call for a new order were divided. With fewer
      than three other partners, the United States voted against five of the third world's fifteen
      "general" principles. Those principles all affirmed parts of the third world view of the economic
      rights and duties of states -- the principle of the equality of states, the principles stating that trade and
      development were global concerns, and ones saying that every state had the right to choose its own economic
      system and control the natural resources within its boundaries. The U.S. was a minority of one opposing a
      principle that disarmament should be undertaken to free funds for development. Between four and nine other DMCs
      joined the U.S. when it opposed approving international commodity agreements, "equitable treatment,"
      and development goals for the IMF. Britain and Australia alone opposed a principle that colonized nations should
      be given special development consideration.
    </p>
<p>
      No one opposed five other principles. Two referred to other special targets for development, the LLDCs and
      landlocked areas. Two more referred directly to the issues that triggered the calls for UNCTAD in the first
      place. DMCs agreed that their own moves toward economic integration, including the European Community, should not
      harm LDCs, and all states agreed that similar regional trade groups among LDCs should be allowed. The final
      principle approved without dissent was the abstract goal of the conference, movement toward a new international
      division of labor.(<a href="#fn0129" id="bck_fn0129">29</a>)
    </p>
<p>
      These votes determined how the Group of 77 would <a id="page_69"></a>interpret the results of the conference.
      While many DMCs opposed the group's practical suggestions for increasing third world income from trade, the
      U.S. could be singled out as the major opponent to the even more fundamental third world principles. That meant
      there was little hope for the immediate future, in spite of all the bright talk about the "development
      decade" that had marked the end of the fifties. Immediately after UNCTAD I most third world spokesmen
      identified the U.S. as the primary author of the postwar system, the system's major beneficiary, and the
      major reason that fundamental reform of the system was impossible.
    </p>
<p>
      Such an assessment may have been too harsh. American opposition to some of the south's principles may only
      have reflected misunderstanding of the south's views. Sidney Weintraub, one of the American delegates, wrote
      after the conference that its "Final Act" (the document containing the fifteen principles) did not
      necessarily reflect what was in the minds of all those at the conference. That is certainly true. But the
      "Final Act" did reflect the ideology that Asian, African, and Latin American representatives to global
      economic meetings had been developing for twenty years; earlier third world positions provide a good guide to
      what was in the minds of southern delegates at UNCTAD; The history of the new order ideology suggests a slightly
      different understanding of "real" third world concerns than the one Weintraub offered.
    </p>
<p>
      Weintraub considered the third world proposals basically self-serving. He felt that the principles opposed by the
      U.S. were designed to let LDCs unfairly claim some of the current wealth some developed states had earned. To him
      the Group of 77<sup>'</sup>s position appeared doubly unfair because it seemed to demand much
      less from the socialist states than from the DMCs.(<a href="#fn0130" id="bck_fn0130">30</a>)
      Both judgements can be questioned even though they logically follow from American premises at the time.
    </p>
<p>
      One American premise was that the rules of international economic conduct had been long established and accepted
      by all nations. Yet in 1964 the the Bretton Woods system had only been operating as it had been intended to for
      five years and its rules had never been accepted by the majority of states at UNCTAD. The south still acted in
      1964 the way the U.S. had in 1944, as if the best structure for international economic relations had yet to be
      discovered and agreed upon.
    </p>
<p>
      A second U.S. premise was that the LDCs goal of a "new" order was just a new way to express an
      old-fashioned state interest in aggrandizment at the expense of others. Yet the more complex third world goal
      remained as it had been in the 1940s; southern states wanted to establish an international economic system based
      on permanent national development rights and responsibilities. By 1964 the relative poverty of the <a id="page_70"></a>third world convinced its leaders that, under their own principles, they were no longer required to
      materially aid other states. Their responsibilities were limited to things like promulgating their
      twenty-year-old "new" moral values within the U.N., values that (while self-serving in the short term)
      were considered a real contribution by many in the south. (<a href="#fn0131" id="bck_fn0131">31</a>) Southern aid and trade proposals in 1964 no more envisioned reducing the wealth of
      the DMCs than the U.S. UNRRA proposals in 1944 envisioned reducing the wealth of Latin American contributors.
      Rather, both sets of proposals aimed at assuring that a specific region of the globe would be able to produce a
      greater proportion of the new wealth constantly created by the world economy. The UNCTAD proposals especially
      aimed at giving the third world more of the globe's trade-induced growth, something the LDCs seemed to have
      lost to the DMCs since the war.
    </p>
<p>
      In contrast, given American premises, the UNCTAD proposals had to be seen as nothing other than a challenge to
      the only legitimate order in the world economy. They had to be understood as part of the LDCs<sup>'</sup> strategy in a worldwide zero sum game in which their economic gain was the DMCs<sup>'</sup> economic loss and in which the DMCs' economic loss was the political gain of their
      greatest rival, the communist bloc.
    </p>
<p>
      Given the nature of the south's grievances, which predated the cold war, the American tendency to understand
      the results of UNCTAD in east-west terms disturbed most southern delegates. Nonetheless, at the first UNCTAD the
      second and third worlds were clearly allies. The socialist governments' goal at the meeting was to, "air
      their grievances against import-export restrictions and discriminatory cold war policies imposed upon them by the
      developed countries."(<a href="#fn0132" id="bck_fn0132">32</a>) Throughout the conference
      socialist states seemed to accommodate third world demands that they expand their trade with the south, thus
      making it appear that the east-south agreement could extend further than the conference floor.(<a href="#fn0133" id="bck_fn0133">33</a>)
    </p>
<p>
      The depth of the increasing ideological rift between first and third worlds can be seen by comparing
      Weintraub's image of the new system that third world governments wanted to create to the image of the postwar
      system held by the most radical third world governments. The extreme northern (e.g., U.S.) and southern views had
      come to resemble the "mirror images" that the superpowers had of each others' aims. Like cold war
      mirror images, the views of the extreme states in the north and south assured ongoing misunderstanding.(<a href="#fn0134" id="bck_fn0134">34</a>) The most radical third world states viewed the postwar
      system as a deliberately engineered mechanism for exploiting poorer nations' property, just as the U.S. saw
      the proposed system as a deliberately engineered mechanism for <a id="page_71"></a>exploiting developed
      nations' property. Both extremes even understood the role of the socialist states in the same way. While
      Weintraub viewed the Group of 77 as unfairly excusing the socialist states from the group's wealth-grabbing
      scheme, some third world leaders viewed DMC moves in the sixties toward expanding east-west trade as ways of
      integrating the socialist countries into the unfair expanding trade system as equal partners and thus leaving the
      third world, the only exploited region, with an even smaller proportion of the world's trade.(<a href="#fn0135" id="bck_fn0135">35</a>)
    </p>
<p>
      Due in part to the fruitless ideological battle between mirror images at UNCTAD, one of the more interesting,
      deeper conflicts between the Group of 77 and the United States hardly appeared: the conflict between the assumed
      primacy of the rights of property owners that underlies laissez faire doctrine and the assumed primacy of
      national governments in defining property rights that stands on the surface of the third world's
      interpretation of the economic rights and duties of states found in the U.N. Charter. Even in 1964 there may have
      been some ground for compromise between north and south on this fundamental point. In practice, northern states
      balanced the claims of property owners against other national interests as much as LDCs, in practice, balanced
      their advocacy of the principle of sovereignty against their other interests.{<a href="#fn0136" id="bck_fn0136">36</a> ) The UNCTAD debate forced neither north nor south to consciously recognize that they
      balanced their property principles with other concerns, and did so in much the same way. The UNCTAD debate did
      not even require them to discuss such fundamental, substantive concerns.
    </p>
<p>
      At the UNCTAD meeting the most fully and fruitfully discussed conflicts between north and south occurred not over
      principles but over specific trade policies and trade theory. Unlike in the debate over principles, in
      discussions of those topics most DMCs shared the same views.
    </p>
<p>
      At the level of practical trade policy north-south differences had abated somewhat even before UNCTAD I, and
      afterward they continued to abate throughout the decade. The IMF's creation of a compensatory financing
      facility illustrates the early move toward greater agreement. Elevation of UNCTAD from a temporary conference to
      a permanent institution of the United Nations created the structure in which commodity agreements could be
      negotiated. Nonetheless, the African proposal for multicommodity agreements remained dormant throughout the
      decade, although the IMP began to investigate ways that its resources might be used to finance buffer
      stocks.(<a href="#fn0137" id="bck_fn0137">37</a>) In addition, the wealthier members of the
      GATT gradually accepted the principle of granting tariff preferences to developing nations. It took until the
      1970s before many states passed the legislation that would actually allow such preferences to be awarded.(<a href="#fn0138" id="bck_fn0138">38</a>)
    </p>
<p>
<a id="page_72"></a>None of these developments on the level of practical policy represented any widespread DMC
      acceptance of the empirical trade theory underlying the Group of 77's trade demands. The IMF's
      compensatory financing facility remained committed to the notion that long run trends in the world market
      represented fair prices. Rich states justified generalized tariff preferences as a new form of foreign aid, not
      as step required to increase third world trade income because it had been declining due to the powers of
      companies in DMCs to control world market prices. Even though the GATT Secretariat had provided evidence of the
      decline in the LDCs' proportion of world trade prior to the first UNCTAD, the GATT did not accept the theory
      that there was a trade-related "income gap" that prevented the LDCs from achieving their development
      aims. After the first UNCTAD, the GATT Secretariat reported that Prebisch's measure of this "gap"
      per se meant nothing because of the differences in export needs among LDCs. These differences made it impossible
      that any theory claiming to explain trade problems could be applied to the entire group of nations.(<a href="#fn0139" id="bck_fn0139">39</a>)
    </p>
<p>
      On the surface, the GATT position on the trade gap seems to say nothing more than Weintraub's observation
      after the first UNCTAD that the trade gap was not necessarily a fact just because the majority of delegates at
      UNCTAD voted to say it was.(<a href="#fn0140" id="bck_fn0140">40</a>) But the GATT position,
      unlike Weintraub's, can be linked directly to Gottfried Haberler's critique of Prebisch's theory.
      Haberler's 1958 GATT report condemning the DMC protectionist policies argued that such policies could cause
      the terms of trade for specific third world goods to decline, but he went on to argue that it was impossible to
      weigh the effects of extra-market interventions on world prices as a whole. The protectionist policies still
      employed by the LDCs might be counteracting the effects of DMC policies or the LDC policies might even be
      improving the terms of trade for some of their goods over the real, free market trend. Case by case analysis
      would be needed in order to determine the actual effects of these interventions. Until such analysis was
      undertaken, Haberler felt this aspect of Prebisch's argument should not be accepted as proven. Haberler also
      argued that it seemed paradoxical to expect that the terms of trade for so many diverse commodities as those sold
      by third world producers would all have the same trend at the same time; again he advocated more detailed study
      of individual cases than the Prebisch reports offered.(<a href="#fn0141" id="bck_fn0141">41</a>)
    </p>
<p>
      The GATT was right that major differences among LDC economies existed in the sixties. The Group of 77 certainly
      recognized that, at least in its attempt to assure that each state's particular concerns become part of the
      alliance position. But the GATT implied that the differences among third world states provided sufficient reason
      for them to support the ultimate creation of a <a id="page_73"></a>world with no trade restrictions. The south
      rejected that implication. At UNCTAD meetings and the international conferences between them, third world
      governments continued to view the terms of trade problem as one they all shared and as one that could not be
      eliminated simply by moving toward a more open trading system.
    </p>
<h2 id="ht0019"><a href="#bck_ht0019">The Group of 77's Politics</a></h2>
<p>
      After the first UNCTAD failed to lead to major changes in global economic regimes, the Group of 77 emphasized
      political victories rather than ones in the realm of economic policy. The group pointed to accomplishments like
      the establishment of rules for further north-south discussions and the creation of the group itself. In fact,
      southern officials considered the institutionalization of the third world alliance to be the most important thing
      UNCTAD achieved.(<a href="#fn0142" id="bck_fn0142">42</a>) In terms of the history of the NIEO
      ideology that is certainly true. The institutionalization of the Group of 77 marked the beginning of the third
      period in the ideology's development, the first period in which the third world alliance developed its own
      political analysis.
    </p>
<p>
      UNCTAD I's hottest debate had made the group extremely concerned with unity. DMC proposals that voting in the
      conference be weighted according to trade wealth caught Asian, African, and Latin American delegates off guard.
      There was nothing new in this request. DMCs were only reaffirming the political principles embodied in the
      Bretton Woods system. Yet the demand surprised third world delegates because they saw precedents for UNCTAD not
      in the IMF and World Bank but in the General Assembly and defunct ITO.(<a href="#fn0143" id="bck_fn0143">43</a>) The group successfully countered the DMC proposal and make UNCTAD adopt two
      decision-making systems, both of which rejected weighted voting: decision by consensus and decision by majority
      rule of states. But the fact that the debate over decision-making rules could take place at all taught members of
      the group two lessons. They learned that the southern alliance had to agree explicitly upon decision-making
      principles. Moreover, they learned to consult among themselves about strategy and tactics as well as goals in
      order to assure that the south could use its majority effectively.(<a href="#fn0144" id="bck_fn0144">44</a>)
    </p>
<p>
      In speeches at the first UNCTAD, southern officials equated the political principles they wanted to see the
      conference adopt with "democratic procedures."(<a href="#fn0145" id="bck_fn0145">45</a>) This equation suggested that the resolutions of UNCTAD and similar meetings were
      "law" justified by popular sovereignty. (<a href="#fn0146" id="bck_fn0146">46</a>)
      If the south had been concerned, first and foremost, with finding the shortest path to increased north-south
      cooperation, the "democratic procedures" slogan would have been a very poor choice. Many officials from
      those DMCs where one person, one vote was more or <a id="page_74"></a>less the rule considered this third world
      concern with "democracy" to be a travesty. Few third world governments even attempted to approach
      democratic representation at home, and all shunned representing equal populations with one vote in international
      organizations.
    </p>
<p>
      However, if we ignore its immediate contribution to greater north-south misunderstanding and concentrate on its
      part in the development of the third world's mobilizing ideology, we can see the progressive role that the
      south's new concern with "democratic procedures" played. It made part of the south's
      unconsciously shared political views very conscious and very public. Arising at the time the Group of 77 itself
      was formed, the dispute over decision-making rules convinced group members that they needed to affirm a
      "political theory," a view of how decisions could and should be made. Developing such political ideas
      meant thinking about how the group's economic ideology could be made dominant. Even the little thought that
      went into quickly responding to the DMCs proposals with calls for more "democratic" means actually
      helped the south. Of course, majority votes in favor of third world proposals could hardly be expected to
      revolutionize the world economic system as long as the system's major supporters did not accept the
      legitimacy of majority rule. On the other hand, structured consensus formation could be used to reform the system
      fundamentally. DMCs would accept such procedures because the north retained its veto.
    </p>
<p>
      In promulgating new rules for "conciliation" at the first UNCTAD, the third world experimented with
      what turned out to be a successful means for making some of its views dominant.(<a href="#fn0147" id="bck_fn0147">47</a>) More importantly, as a result of debate over political procedures, Group of 77
      members, for the first time, became very aware that they really needed to test various political means and
      consciously repeat successfully employed ones, recognize the limits of their success, and consciously avoid
      repeating fruitless methods. By the end of the decade third world spokesmen knew that the systems of structured
      consensus building first attempted at UNCTAD I were an effective means of obtaining specific concessions from the
      developed nations but an ineffective means for achieving agreement on principles.(<a href="#fn0148" id="bck_fn0148">48</a>)
    </p>
<p>
      In the years immediately following the first UNCTAD, the Group of 77 hardly built upon the political analysis it
      had so rapidly adopted in 1964. The group continued to work on the basis of "democratic" consensus
      formation with the major economic powers to come to agreements on specific concessions. The group tried to get
      decisions by majority rule when decision by consensus was impossible, but even by the second UNCTAD meeting in
      1968 most LDC governments had started to distance themselves from the ineffective posturing that unenforceable
      majority rule decisions represented.(<a href="#fn0149" id="bck_fn0149">49</a>)
    </p>
<p>
<a id="page_75"></a>Meanwhile, third world perceptions of the need to develop political links within the group
      convinced governments to make existing links more concrete. Between the first UNCTAD and the second, the group
      demonstrated the significance of its unity, and the fact that in certain contexts majority rule decisions could
      be effective, by its ability to unite U.N. aid programs and create the Industrial Development Organization
      (UNIDO) over the objection of DMC governments.(<a href="#fn0150" id="bck_fn0150">50</a>) The
      Asian, African, and Latin American conferences of the Group of 77 prior to second UNCTAD resulted on unified
      regional positions. The group's meeting in Algiers prior to the conference easily resolved what differences
      there were in the regional plans. At UNCTAD II the group appointed designated spokesmen to argue their majority
      position.(<a href="#fn0151" id="bck_fn0151">51</a>) Nonetheless, neither the majorities that
      the group bothered to muster behind its proposals, nor the consensus-making process, resulted in international
      agreement on fundamental issues.
    </p>
<p>
      After the second disappointing meeting of UNCTAD, the third world's political tactics became more complex,
      third world governments added to the notion of using "democratic means" to advance their position the
      idea that they should consciously attempt to influence elite and public opinion in the developed states. The
      group actually adopted this political tactic while under the influence of DMC elite opinion.
    </p>
<p>
      When former American defense secretary Robert McNamara began his presidency of the World Bank he called upon
      former Canadian prime minister Lester Pearson to form a commission and report to him on international development
      needs. Pearson chose Arthur Lewis and Roberto de Oliveria Campos along with five statesmen from the DMCs to join
      him. Their report, <span>Partners in Development</span>, ran through four popular printings in
      1969 and 1970 after its first release in 1968.(<a href="#fn0152" id="bck_fn0152">52</a>) The
      authors' proposals fundamentally agreed with the Group of 77's. The commission added a concern with
      establishing development related population programs that echoed proposals made by a number of group members but
      that had been rejected as part of the consensus of the group.(<a href="#fn0153" id="bck_fn0153">53</a>) Likewise, the Pearson Commission expressed a concern for equalizing the distribution
      of wealth within developing nations. Governments of individual third world states had expressed such views, but
      the group had never collectively accepted them.(<a href="#fn0154" id="bck_fn0154">54</a>) At
      the same time, the Pearson Commission affirmed a moral duty of the rich to aid the poor that was compatible with
      the third world views of states' economic rights and duties.
    </p>
<p>
      LDCs praised the Pearson Commission from the outset, although a number of governments demurred over the issue of
      birth control. Many third world U.N. representatives immediately adopted the simple political analysis the
      Pearson Commission report offered for the failure of <a id="page_76"></a>previous international development
      efforts; they represented failures of "political will" on the part of governments, especially DMC
      governments.(<a href="#fn0155" id="bck_fn0155">55</a>) The delegate from Cameroon expressed
      the southern view well when he argued that "political will" had created the Marshall Plan and
      "political will" could still create effective international cooperation for economic
      development.(<a href="#fn0156" id="bck_fn0156">56</a>)
    </p>
<p>
      To energize DMC political will in 1968, the third world suggested mounting a campaign to influence DMC public
      opinion.(<a href="#fn0157" id="bck_fn0157">57</a>) In 1969 Tanzania proposed that legislators
      from the Group of 77 attempt to influence fellow parliamentarians in developed countries to change their
      governments' foreign policies.(<a href="#fn0158" id="bck_fn0158">58</a>) The General
      Assembly's extensive Declaration on Social Progress and Development of 1969 reflect both proposals. In
      addition, as part of the campaign to change northern opinion, the General Assembly charged the Secretary General
      with disseminating the declaration as widely as possible.(<a href="#fn0159" id="bck_fn0159">59</a>)
    </p>
<p>
      Events since 1969 may make us think the third world was naive to believe that public opinion in the north
      mattered. No theory which considered public opinion important appears to have guided the one set of third world
      actions that actually made the most people in the north aware of southern views — i.e., the unpopular OPEC price
      increases. Yet in the U.N. debates of 1968 and 1969 only one member of the group, Sudan, argued that an emphasis
      on influencing DMC public opinion was misguided.(<a href="#fn0160" id="bck_fn0160">60</a>)
    </p>
<p>
      Events in 1968 made the third world belief in the effectiveness of public and legislative opinion very
      reasonable. An American president had refused to run for another term when it became clear to him that the public
      and Congress would no longer support his foreign policy approach. Mass demonstrations almost toppled the French
      government. Moreover, the liberal western political theories that a majority of third world leaders had learned
      and still accepted, in theory if not in practice, identified the opinions and goals of mass publics and their
      representatives as the proper source of foreign policy, and, much more importantly, as the actual source of
      foreign policy in those states with active liberal political institutions, the DMCs.(<a href="#fn0161" id="bck_fn0161">61</a>)
    </p>
<p>
      Despite these good reasons for attempting to influence DMC opinion, third world attempts to energize northern
      political will remained small operations throughout the sixties. The only resources committed to the effort were
      those of the U.N. agencies, the Secretary General's office and UNCTAD in particular. Yet this small-scale
      expression of concern with influencing DMC opinion had effects on the emerging DMC ideology beyond the simple
      fact that it happened to be one of the earliest bits of political theory the Group of 77 collectively and
      consciously adopted. Like moves toward strengthening the alliance itself, attempting to <a id="page_77"></a>influence the attitudes of people within DMCs required LDC supporters to present their opinions
      about the world economy in a more unified and coherent, and thus more convincing, form. It required third world
      leaders to make their ideology even more explicit and distinct.
    </p>
<h2 id="ht0020"><a href="#bck_ht0020">More New Economic Issues for the
    South</a></h2>
<p>
      However, the real diversity of interests within the third world mitigated against the development of a more
      explicit, coherent, and convincing ideology in the late sixties. That diversity had been made greater by new
      economic issues. The Bretton Woods system's heyday of income and trade growth affected different third world
      states in different ways. While the Group of 77 was able to respond to the new issues by creating hypothetical
      programs that would have provided some benefits to every third world state if they were enacted, the group had
      trouble finding ways to logically link all the new programs they proposed in a single, coherent economic policy
      analysis. The group could easily blame some of the new problems on the Bretton Woods system; analysis of those
      problems could be easily integrated into the ideology. Those problems that could not be so easily blamed on the
      system were much harder to coherently link to the rest of the ideology.
    </p>
<p>
      The increasing lack of coherence in the ideology's policy analysis became all the more problematic because
      the south's solidarity behind a single interpretation of the economic rights and duties of states began to
      break. In the late sixties had enlarged the third world alliance to included governments that defined the
      economic duties of wealthy states as responsibilities incumbent upon them because of their past or current
      colonialism. Potentially, this opinion could have wrecked the ideological foundation of the third world alliance
      by opening up ethical questions which had be closed for years. Instead, members of the group simply stopped
      reiterating one part of the ethical foundation of their analysis. They continued to discuss the the economic
      <span>rights</span> of states in general terms as well as the specific duties of wealthy
      states, including a duty they newly agreed was incumbent upon colonizers, like Portugal and South Africa, to
      compensate for their colonialism. But, in the late 1960s the south ignore its older argument that the general,
      permanent duty of every state to unique economic development of other states provided the major reason why
      material aid could be demanded from the wealthy.
    </p>
<p>
      While members of the Group of 77 never publically confronted each other with demands to debate their different
      moral codes the disagreement over principles reinforced newly developing conflicts of interest within <a id="page_78"></a>the alliance. Poorer LDCs supported one ethic; richer LDCs supported another. Without a unifying
      view of the economic rights and duties of states it became hard for LDCs to argue that all the new problems
      separate states experienced in the 1960s should be with under the same agenda. This reassured those supporters of
      the existing economic system who believed that third world calls for a "new" economic system were
      inherently incoherent. Even if, as the third world argued, there were some unfortunate unintended consequences
      resulting from the operation of the Bretton Woods system, those problems appeared to be localized ones that in no
      way changed the evaluation of the Bretton Woods system offered by its strongest advocates: Under the system world
      trade and economic growth had expanded like they never had before, and they had done so at the expense of no
      nation.
    </p>
<p>
      Of course, third world states measured the costs of the Bretton Woods system not against systems that had gone
      before but against the expected costs of the reformed system they wanted to see created. In those terms, they
      could argue that the actual system had unexpected costs that only some states had borne.
    </p>
<p>
      Throughout the sixties third world governments linked their analyses of the disadvantages of the IMF and World
      Bank. Functionally, both institutions seemed the same to many hard-pressed governments. Both provided loans that
      could be used to meet government expenses. Likewise, third world leaders thought of the bilateral aid systems in
      the same terms. The bilateral aid systems functioned as part of the world economic order, the Bretton Woods
      system broadly understood. In the sixties four new effects of the postwar aid and monetary order came to bother
      third world governments.
    </p>
<p>
      As we have seen, those less industrialized countries that actually did receive loans for development in the
      fifties had trouble repaying their debts, especially when that had taking out short term loans to finance the
      sort of infrastructure projects the south most demanded in the fifties. Such projects showed no immediate profit
      and mounting debt became even more difficult to pay back since third world trade remained stagnant.(<a href="#fn0162" id="bck_fn0162">62</a>)
    </p>
<p>
      At the opposite end of the spectrum of wealth, the poorest LDCs felt the aid system led to the increasing
      relative impoverishment of the LLDCs relative to other states. LLDCs received a small proportion of available
      aid. The World Bank's understandable concern with its own financial health meant that prior to the creation
      of the IDA it loaned mostly to states that could easily pay their debts, states that were relatively wealthy
      already.(<a href="#fn0163" id="bck_fn0163">63</a>)
    </p>
<p>
      Third world governments identified a similar problem associated with world liquidity. Because the U.S. dollar had
      been the world<sup>'</sup>s most accepted currency since the war the U.S. could expand global
      liquidity accumulating trade <a id="page_79"></a>deficits for goods Americans purchased abroad. Consequently, the
      initial benefits of expanding the amount of money in global circulation went to the United States, the wealthiest
      state; and because the U.S.'s most important trade partners were DMCs, the multiplier effects of increasingly
      global liquidity were extended almost exclusively to the DMCs, thus, in the third world view, increasing the
      relative poverty of the LDCs. (<a href="#fn0164" id="bck_fn0164">64</a>) When the IMF moved
      toward creating an internationally managed means for expanding global liquidity in the latter half of the decade
      ·— through IMF Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) — IMF member allocated those funds on the basis of the IMF quotas
      used to compute voting weights. This system had almost the same effect as the pure dollar standard. It gave most
      of the initial advantages of increasing the global money supply to the already wealthy regions.(<a href="#fn0165" id="bck_fn0165">65</a>)
    </p>
<p>
      Third world states first raised one final, related issue in the sixties. Those third world states that had taken
      advantage of bilateral aid began to draw attention to the economic strings attached to economic aid in the same
      way that they first had brought attention to political strings in the 1950s. Requirements that aid be used to
      purchase goods from donor countries — goods that could often be purchased at lower prices elsewhere — especially
      bothered them. Beyond the simple economic disadvantages of these arrangements when compared to the multilateral
      aid systems the south had advocated since the forties, the economic strings attached to bilateral aid increased
      the recipient economy's dependence on that of the donor.
    </p>
<p>
      As we have seen, the third world's solutions to the new aid problems they discovered in the sixties were
      similar to the solutions they offered to similar problems in the fifties. Because they blamed those aid problems
      on the Bretton Woods system, they simply used their existing principles and plans for an alternative system in
      order to understand and suggest solutions to the new problems. Under their long standing principles, the south
      emphasized the special responsibility of all states to aid the LLDCs and defined the minimal material
      responsibility of the developed nations with the aid target of 1 percent of GNP. In addition, the south acted to
      assure that the U.N.'s Special Fund and technical assistance programs would be coordinated and directed
      toward third world industrialization, thus creating a model for the multilateral aid system the south desired.
    </p>
<p>
      To third world leaders, inadequacies in the existing system also explained the new monetary problems they
      experienced. In again blaming Bretton Woods third world leaders, sought solutions to the new monetary problems in
      slight amendments to their own emerging vision of an alternative system. They talked about expanding the IMF so
      that it became, in part, an aid agency. They proposed <a id="page_80"></a>that any new international liquidity
      created by the IMF be allocated to states on the basis of some measure of economic need.(<a href="#fn0166" id="bck_fn0166">66</a>) This proposal went back to ideas on the subject advanced in the 1950s
      by Maxwell Stamp, the British director of the IMF, and from there back to Lord Keynes's bag of hypothetical
      economic tricks and to the alternative vision of the postwar system which had been the basis for the third
      world's own policy analysis.(<a href="#fn0167" id="bck_fn0167">67</a>) The south justified
      the proposed "Link" in the same way they justified other aid programs, as a way for wealthy states to
      fufill their duty to materially aid the economic development plans chosen by those less advantaged.
    </p>
<p>
      Supporters of the Bretton Woods system never denied that the system in part "caused" the four new aid
      and monetary problems that third world states experienced in the sixties. Supporters did deny that the things
      that "caused" the problems were problems in themselves. Instead, they saw them as necessary elements in
      any truly workable aid and money regimes. The problems experienced by the richest and poorest LDCs were
      unfortunate, but, Bretton Woods system advocates argued, no state or private investor would give development
      loans if they did not expect them to be repaid. True, supporters argued, the unique role of the U.S. in expanding
      world liquidity had never been carefully planned, but the fact that it (somewhat surprisingly) worked was reason
      enough to maintain the principle it embodied of expanding liquidity to nations on the basis of their economic
      might. Likewise, many leaders saw tying aid to repurchase agreements as a small domestic political price that
      rich countries had to pay in order to offer any aid at all. To supporters of Bretton Woods, these were less
      problems than facts, and certainly they were not the basis for new grievances with the existing order.
    </p>
<p>
      Third world spokesmen in the sixties did not try to respond to northern doubts about the reality of the new aid
      and money problems the south faced. They might have been able to do so by explaining how the emerging
      hypothetical alternative to Bretton Woods would insure things like investor confidence and popular support for
      aid from within DMCs, but it had been hard enough to integrate these new issues into the third world's own
      prior understanding. Yet these aid and money issues were easier to integrate into the southern consensus than
      another set of problems third world states experienced in the sixties, ones that could not be blamed so easily on
      the Bretton Woods system. Had third world officials been more willing to grant the Bretton Woods system its
      successes they might have been able to see this final set of new problems as like their new aid and money
      problems: unintended byproducts of the postwar system's operation.
    </p>
<p>
      The increasingly liberal trade system that the postwar regimes advanced provided opportunities for large <a id="page_81"></a>firms to invest abroad with greater ease than ever before. Of course, individually, almost every
      country around the world also encouraged such investment. By the end of the sixties, nevertheless, most third
      world states expressed some dissatisfactions with their relationships to what the U.N. Secretariat had dubbed in
      mid-decade "transnational corporations," TNCs.(<a href="#fn0168" id="bck_fn0168">68</a>) Third world representatives complained of profits being repatriated in excess of the
      funds brought into the country by foreign firms, and of the difficulties in assuring that foreign investors
      followed the guidelines set out in national development plans.(<a href="#fn0169" id="bck_fn0169">69</a>) While third world spokesmen did not try to explain the rise of TNCs, the southern
      ethic suggested where solutions to their problems with TNCs might be found. It pointed toward finding the means
      to assure that the self-defined interests of states remained sovereign in relations with foreign firms. But the
      1960s closed not only before the south developed a shared analysis of the rise of TNCs but also before they even
      came to share views about how to combat the problems foreign investment created. The south turned over the
      problem of developing such analysis to the United Nations secretariats.(<a href="#fn0170" id="bck_fn0170">70</a>)
    </p>
<p>
      A somewhat similar problem, "the brain drain," also became a third world issue in the sixties. The
      successes of the liberal international system helped make it possible for highly skilled people from poorer
      countries to find and move to jobs in the richest parts of the world. In the sixties third world governments saw
      the brain drain as a problem, but the Group of 77 offered no analysis of its origins or specific programs for
      eliminating it or its effects.(<a href="#fn0171" id="bck_fn0171">71</a>)
    </p>
<p>
      A sort of obverse of the brain drain became a new issue in the sixties as well. Skilled people left poorer
      countries to go to wealthier ones, but that transfer was not balanced by the transfer of skills and technology
      from the rich to the poor. The postwar international economic system treated technological innovations like any
      other property. Governments of poorer countries could have access to new technology only through the market, by
      buying patent rights or encouraging the owners of those rights to invest in the poor country. In the sixties,
      however, before the role of the Bretton Woods system as a protector of existing property rights had been openly
      and loudly debated, the third world raised their concerns about increasing "technology transfers"
      without linking those concerns to specific condemnations of existing regimes. Rather, third world governments
      proposed the existence of a new "right to the fruits of technology," a proposal to treat know-how as a
      common good, a collective resource that no individual could claim an ultimate property right to control.(<a href="#fn0172" id="bck_fn0172">72</a>) In later years discussion of this view would open up the
      north-south debate over <a id="page_82"></a>limits on the roles of international economic management
      organizations that was never opened at the UNCTAD conferences or at other meetings in the sixties. In the
      sixties, beyond the simple affirmation that this new right — an extension of the rights and duties of states —
      existed, the third world had little more to say about easing the transfer of technology.
    </p>
<p>
      The TNC, brain drain, and technology transfer issues would have contributed little to the increasing incoherence
      of the third world's "new" ideology had the Group of 77 been able to remain solidly behind the view
      of states economic rights and duties they had long shared, the ideas that justified the first southern views on
      these new issues. But the Group of 77 did not remain solidly behind its oldest principles at the end of the
      1960s. Paradoxically, decolonization, which increased the number of states in the third world, proved the
      greatest threat to the alliance's unity. Unity could only be restored, in the short run, by deemphasizing the
      older principles.
    </p>
<p>
      Governments of the newer states, mostly African, explained the duties of developed states to make extra efforts
      on behalf of the globe's poor in a markedly different way than older members of the third world alliance
      explained the same duty. The more radical African governments in the early sixties, following those of Guinea and
      Ghana, consistently spoke of duties imposed on wealthy states by the fact that they had once exploited their
      colonies.(<a href="#fn0173" id="bck_fn0173">73</a>) The former colonizers owed a debt to the
      colonized. Africans suggested many historical precedents for such notions, including the compensation paid by the
      American government to former slaves, the more significant twentieth century precedent of the war debts paid by
      those who lost the world wars, and the debts paid by the Federal Republic of Germany to Jewish citizens and to
      the state of Israel.(<a href="#fn0174" id="bck_fn0174">74</a>) Franz Fanon's <span>The Wretched of the Earth</span>, published in the early sixties, expressed this view well:
    </p>
<p>
      When we hear the head of a European state declare with his hand on his heart that he must come to the aid of poor
      underdeveloped people we do not tremble with gratitude. Quite the contrary; we say to ourselves: "It's a
      just reparation which will be paid to us."(<a href="#fn0175" id="bck_fn0175">75</a>)
    </p>
<p>
      During the sixties this theme was taken up by representatives of many new states both within and outside of
      Africa in such a way that latent divisions among third world states became apparent.
    </p>
<p>
      If this ethic of reparations were to be accepted in lieu of the notion of permanent states' economic rights
      and duties, then either many of the early members of the third world movement, including the Latin American
      <a id="page_83"></a>states, would have no claim to aid from wealthy-countries, or else the relevant historical
      period for assessing debts would have to be pushed back to the beginning of the modern world economy. In the
      later case the analytical distinction in the third world ideology that colonialism was the basic early cause of
      underdevelopment would be given moral force as well. Few nations accepted this particular resolution of the
      differences between newer and older members of the alliance in the sixties. Latin American delegates to
      international meetings, in particular, almost never used the historical argument from colonialism as a
      justification for the duties of wealthy states.(<a href="#fn0176" id="bck_fn0176">76</a>)
    </p>
<p>
      In peculiar contrast, some wealthy states used the restitution ethic to justify their lack of action-in support
      of the LDCs. By the 1968 second UNCTAD the socialist states of eastern Europe, which had appeared to be so
      cooperative to the third world at UNCTAD I, had adopted the restitution ethic. They said that their duties
      differed from those of the DMCs because as socialist states they neither had been colonizers nor had they
      exploited poorer countries through the instruments of neocolonialism. (<a href="#fn0177" id="bck_fn0177">77</a>) Neocolonialism, after all, had been linked only to capitalism by the popularizer of
      the concept, Kwame Nkrumah.(<a href="#fn0178" id="bck_fn0178">78</a>)
    </p>
<p>
      After they learned the position that the socialists would take, Group of 77 members reunited behind at least that
      part of their old ethic that said all rich states had duties to poor ones. The Charter of Algiers, agreed to
      before UNCTAD II, reflected that part of the earlier stand without ever mentioning reparations for
      colonialism.(<a href="#fn0179" id="bck_fn0179">79</a>)
    </p>
<p>
      This charter makes specific demands upon the socialist states. Nonetheless, it devotes no space to outlining the
      general ethic for international economic relations. In one sense, this lack of the usual restatement of the
      general ethic could be interpreted as just reflecting a recognition that the principles of the new economic order
      had already been stated at the first UNCTAD and voting on them again at the second would just be an example of a
      fruitless use of the Group of 77's majority. Now was the time to "move away from the stage of
      deliberation to the plane of practical action. "(<a href="#fn0180" id="bck_fn0180">80</a>) But, by not explicitly restating the older understanding of the economic rights and
      duties of states and saying that they were the only fundamental principles for the new order, the Group of 77
      left room for some of its members to argue for aid on the basis of the restitution ethic.
    </p>
<p>
      Two factors continued to assure that the dispute over the restitution ethic would generate further developments
      in the south's ideology. First, most of the LDCs to which the ethic appealed were also LLDCs, those that were
      the most dependent on exports of commodities <a id="page_84"></a>that sold in what they believed to be
      particularly wild, fluctuating markets, and those that received the least foreign aid. This was the group of
      countries some scholars in the north started to call the "fourth world," the poorest nations whose
      economic interests differed from those of the wealthier third world states. The restitution ethic symbolized the
      particularly severe problems of the least advantaged. Second, the ideological predilictions of many of those
      people sympathetic to the LDCs in rich countries made them more sympathetic to the restitution argument than to
      the one based upon assumed permanent rights and duties of states. Jean Paul Sartre exemplifies this northern view
      in his preface to <span>The Wretched of the Earth</span> where he argues that the shame
      Europeans feel when confronted with knowledge of the worst horrors of colonialism would make them accept
      Fanon's view that restitution was essential.(<a href="#fn0181" id="bck_fn0181">81</a>)
    </p>
<p>
      Yet at the end of the sixties, when third world states first mounted an effort to influence public and elite
      opinion in the north, they did not rely on the powerful restitution ethic because not all third world states
      shared it. The 1969 Declaration on Social Progress and Development, which was supposed to be so widely
      distributed, exemplifies the moral compromises the alliance had to reach at the end of the decade. (<a href="#fn0182" id="bck_fn0182">82</a>) Its second and third articles lay out the by then
      traditional rights of states. Its first, fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh articles lay out specific egalitarian
      rights of individuals and families. The bulk of the rest of the document lays out only specific duties of
      governments, some of governments in developed countries, some of governments in developing countries. Article 26
      specifies that restitution for aggression and illegal occupation must be paid by the aggressor state. But this
      article does not say that back payments for colonialism that had ended was necessary. All the specific UNCTAD
      principles of 1964 are included as specific duties. What is missing in this program, as in the Charter of
      Algiers, is an overarching article explaining all these duties of developed states under a single justification
      -- either as specific instances of a duty to aid the unique economic development of the neediest or as specific
      instances of a duty to provide reparations for colonialism.
    </p>
<p>
      In some ways, of course, this loose definition of the duties of developed states, this lack of an overarching
      article, contributed to the later success of the ideology in attracting supporters in the developed world. Third
      world silence on the ultimate moral ground of northern duties under their new economic order allowed northern
      supporters to choose their own justification. Like Sartre, they could emphasize a duty based on historical rights
      violated during colonialism. Like Pearson, they could emphasize a general, ahistorical duty <a id="page_85"></a>of wealthy states. Nevertheless, the person in the developed countries who was not yet sympathetic
      to the plight of the LDCs could find as many contradictions in the late-1960s version of the third world position
      as sympathizers could find justifications for creating a new economic order.
    </p>
<p>
      This incoherence in the third world view at the end of the decade made it difficult for those who first observed
      global economic meetings then to see the "third world" as a reality. Identifying a "third world
      ideology" from a single meeting at the end of the sixties would be just as difficult. Just as the new order
      ideology had been temporarily lost in the cooperative north-south dialogue at the beginning of the
      "development decade," the disagreements within the south at decade's end made statements of their
      common position increasingly vague, abstract, and indistinct. Observation of the common third world position at
      any point in the decade other than its very beginning and end would yield an entirely different picture. The new
      order ideology remained distinct throughout most of the sixties.
    </p>
<p>
      It passed through two separate stages of growth just as significant as the first stage it had passed through
      while the Bretton Woods system was forming. The second and third stages, like the first one, were characterized
      by fundamentally new issues that members of the third world alliance were learning to apprehend in the same way.
      During the whole decade southern adherents to the new order ideology reiterated their consensus about the
      economic problems that the Bretton Woods system left unresolved and added to it an analysis of what to do about
      new problems that the operation of the Bretton Woods system helped create. In the first half of the decade, the
      second stage in the development of the ideology, only these new problems related to the system's operation
      served to trigger ideological innovation.
    </p>
<p>
      The second half of the decade, the third stage in the ideology's development, was more eventful. Adherents
      consciously defined their collective political identity, made the further specification of their shared views a
      conscious goal, and began to develop strategies to make their views dominant. Of course the third world had a
      collective identity by 1959, but conscious reflection on that identity, which was needed before further
      specification of shared views could be made a conscious goal, only came with the formation of the Group of 77 and
      the subsequent development of political strategy which marked the third stage.
    </p>
<p>
      The fact that reflection upon their collective identity had become commonplace for group members by the end of
      the decade made it possible for them to consciously redefine that identity in order to assure group unity. When
      the ideological conflicts between the richer and poorer developing states appeared at the end <a id="page_86"></a>of the decade members of the group could make their shared views more amorphous to accommodate the
      conflicting views. That made the group's ideology look less coherent. But a more significant commitment to
      consciously developing a shared position remained the foundation for the group's stated views, even at the
      end of the sixties. Reinforced by strategic commitment to group unity that developed as a conscious political
      tactic in the late sixties, the ability to reflect upon and redefine what it meant to be "the third
      world" allowed the alliance to rapidly turn their position, which was temporarily amorphous at the end of
      the sixties, into the much more coherent and concrete calls for a New International Economic Order that dominated
      the seventies.

    1970–1974: Cracks in the Old Order and Calls for the New</a></h1>
<p>
        If listeners to the lengthy speeches and readers of the flow of documents acquired a slight sensation of having
        heard much of the debate before, a rapid perusal of earlier documents will show their suspicions to be
        justified. "What I tell you three times is true," is, of course, very largely the case in relation to
        the developing world's problems.
      </p>
<p>
        — Barbara Ward, 1974
      </p>
<p>
        The Present Declaration on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order shall be one of the most
        important bases for relations between all peoples and nations.
      </p>
<p>
        — The General Assembly, 1974(<a href="#fn0183" id="bck_fn0183">1</a>)
      </p>
<p>
      If anything, Barbara Ward's sympathy for the third world makes her overestimate the originality of the 1974
      New International Economic Order texts. Only the notion that the third world policy analysis was sophisticated
      enough to actually govern global economic relations was new. The 1974 documents repeated old views, yet they were
      more consistent and comprehensive than any previous set of new order texts. In 1974 the newly named
      "NIEO" ideology provided a more coherent basis for an alternative to Bretton Woods than it ever had
      before.
    </p>
<p>
      Nonetheless, in retrospect the language of the 1974 texts has even more of an Alice in Wonderland quality than
      Barbara Ward detected. But when they wrote the 1974 texts, new order advocates shared a new hope that the old
      order was falling. They believed that restating their views could be something more than ritual. Third world
      officials knew as well as Barbara Ward did that no genie with magic words, or even the wiliest sympathizers with
      the U.N., would be able to convince all governments of the truth of the third world position. But changes in
      <a id="page_92"></a>American economic policy beginning in 1971 appeared to signal the end of the postwar economic
      system. The system's operation had begun to have unanticipated consequences unacceptable to its major
      supporters. By 1974 all national governments recognized a need to change the international economic order. The
      LDCs thought they had a chance to influence the change that was bound to take place.
    </p>
<p>
      To be able to present the coherent new order proposals they presented, third world governments had to engage in
      unprecedented, complex international politics between 1970 and 1974. Four types of third world actions influenced
      the coherence and content of the ΝΙΕO ideology by the time the proposals it framed had become major issues on the
      international agenda.
    </p>
<p>
      First, in uniting to react to the increased trade restrictions imposed by the U.S. and the decreased value of all
      aid as a result of American actions taken in 1971 third world officials reaffirmed that the unity of their
      alliance was fundamental and that it was based on common grievances with the present global economic order. They
      reaffirmed that the present order operated to the equal detriment of all third world states.
    </p>
<p>
      Second, to help cement the renewed unity that these new grievances established, third world leaders — both
      government officials and scholars — began to adopt the intellectual framework provided by the dependency and
      neocolonialism theories that had been worked out by independent third world thinkers since the mid-1960s. That
      framework provided a more coherent way to understand the most recent problems experienced by third world
      countries, the problems associated with TNCs and existing impediments to the transfer of technology. The
      framework served to minimize new research on economic differences among third world regions, differences which
      had caused the cracks in the LDC alliance in the late sixties. And analyses of dependency and neocolonialism
      convinced some of the leaders of older third world states in Latin America and Asia to accept that developed
      states had historical duties to LDCs; thus the dependency framework contributed to a resolution of the conflict
      over ethics between richer and poorer third world states.
    </p>
<p>
      The dependency framework also justified a greater sense of grievance with developed nations because it suggested
      that LDCs had suffered from ideological as well as political domination. The sense of grievance helped legitimate
      more aggressive actions to improve the economic position of the south — including the OPEC price increases —
      while it called into question the ability of developed states to negotiate major changes in the economic order
      without prodding. Third world political action more militant than the employment of "democratic means"
      thus became more acceptable to the alliance as a whole. In addition, the dependency <a id="page_93"></a>framework
      suggested that fundamental change in the international system could remove dependence. Third world leaders had to
      argue for revolutionary change.
    </p>
<p>
      While doing so they resolved the roles of their, still contradictory views of the responsibility of developed
      nations. The restitution ethic became the basis for the north's moral duty to negotiate a new order. The
      notion of permanent states rights and duties to aid the unique economic development of every other state remained
      the single ethic that would guide action in the world economic system that would then be created.
    </p>
<p>
      A third aspect of the inter-LDC politics that created the 1974 new order demands is leadership. Leadership of the
      alliance as a whole was much more evident and important in the early 1970s than it had been ever before. Leaders
      tended to select themselves rather than be selected; nonetheless, in the early seventies some national
      governments and individuals organized the entire alliance to anticipate and employ the newly experienced economic
      vulnerabilities of the postwar system's supporters.
    </p>
<p>
      Finally, third world governments united to anticipate and react to the new economic policies that developed
      states suggested in international meetings as proposed solutions to the system's crises. Some policies
      advocated by the north, creating international means for dealing with environmental degradation and controlling
      population, were responses to the unanticipated "resource limits to growth" revealed by the vast
      expansion of the world economy since the war. Similarly, northern proposals for controlling the international
      energy trade were indirectly responses to limits to growth problems, although much more directly to the
      unanticipated development of a powerful bloc of third world oil producers. The responses of third world leaders
      to these problems had consequences for their NIEO ideology. Southern ideologists argued the oil price increases
      were legitimate but changed their views on some other issues in response to the north's concerns.
    </p>
<p>
      This chapter begins with a review of the divisions within the southern alliance in 1970. Then it discusses the
      causes of each of the four types of political action outlined above, their consequences for the new order
      ideology, and the sources of new elements added to the ideology as the result of each type of action.
    </p>
<h2 id="ht0023"><a href="#bck_ht0023">The Third World Divided</a></h2>
<p>
      In 1970 observers could see two camps in the third world. Each had a different approach to international and
      domestic economic problems. Those differences can be exemplified by contrasts between the resolutions of the
      nonaligned states, which met that year in Lusaka, and the <a id="page_94"></a>resolutions on the Second
      Development Decade that the General Assembly adopted a few months later.(<a href="#fn0184" id="bck_fn0184">2</a>) The first program was much more radical than the second.
    </p>
<p>
      Both theoretical and tactical differences separated the two blocs within the third world. The nonaligned states,
      predominantly nations that had obtained their independence since the second world war, predominantly from Africa,
      and predominantly very poor, emphasized colonialism and neocolonialism as the forces impeding global economic
      change. The General Assembly where the Latin American states played a major role (and, of course, where the
      developed states had a voice) concentrated on more specific barriers to economic change, things that had long
      been identified by supporters of the new order ideology — low levels of international aid and trade restrictions
      imposed on third world products, for example. The General Assembly did not mention neocolonialism. It limited its
      political discussion to reiteration of specific economic duties of states and closed by calling on national
      governments, particularly in developed states, to influence public opinion and convince the wealthy of their
      duties. The nonaligned states, in contrast, spoke of "democratic means" only in terms of
      "democratization of international relations," that is, "the right of all countries to participate
      in international relations on an equal footing."(<a href="#fn0185" id="bck_fn0185">3</a>)
      In addition, the nonaligned states emphasized economic duties of developing states toward one another by focusing
      on a newly named strategy, "collective self-reliance."(<a href="#fn0186" id="bck_fn0186">4</a>)
    </p>
<p>
      In 1970 collective self-reliance was still more of a symbol than a program. It referred to no one policy. Aid to
      the least developed states, autarky, and receiving aid from China were all included under this rubric.
    </p>
<p>
      The notion of collective self-reliance grew out of the frustrations felt by the poorest developing nations with
      their unsuccessful attempts in the sixties to find solutions to their economic problems through changes in the
      global system. The states most concerned with collective self-reliance were the ones that first raised the issue
      of aid to the least developed in the 1960s. The principle had been affirmed by the U.N. but in 1970 it still had
      no influence on the policies of aid agencies, including the U.N. programs.(<a href="#fn0187" id="bck_fn0187">5</a>) In response to international aid that they felt was meager relative to their needs,
      some LLDC governments began to consider their own national resources to be the only sure basis upon which they
      could make development plans. "Self-reliance" symbolized that recognition without pointing to any
      particular policy. " Collective self-reliance" of third world states suggested that inter-third world
      aid and cooperation was essential. The nonaligned states committed themselves to that aid without specifying
      programs except to reiterate that all <a id="page_95"></a>third world states should unite behind efforts to aid
      the least developed.(<a href="#fn0188" id="bck_fn0188">6</a>)
    </p>
<p>
      The General Assembly as a whole, in contrast, included all of the relatively wealthy third world states. By 1970
      some of those states, especially in Latin America, had already become a sort of global "middle class,"
      a semiperiphery capable of making some economic advances within the postwar system. They did not suffer the
      specific frustrations the LLDCs knew. To most Latin American states the idea of opting out of the present system,
      which seemed to be what "self-reliance" meant, was absurd.
    </p>
<p>
      Of course, opting out of the international system was just as absurd to most nonaligned members. They had no such
      choice. Their international affirmation of self-reliance reflected little desire to leave the system. Instead, it
      reflected their growing realization that most developed states were not going to expand their aid commitments no
      matter how poorer states tried to convince northern elites of the moral duties incumbent upon the wealthy or upon
      former colonizers. The nonaligned adopted the view presented by the Sudanese in the U.N. two years earlier:
      Developed states gave aid for their own reasons. The poorest states were forced to be self reliant, or, at least,
      reliant upon the collective help that developing states could offer one another.(<a href="#fn0189" id="bck_fn0189">7</a>)
    </p>
<p>
      In affirming collective self-reliance the more radical nonaligned states moved away from the position that the
      duties of former colonizers to aid former colonies could be an effective ethic in the international economy. The
      duties of third world states under "collective self-reliance" reflected the duties the nonaligned had
      said every state had at Bandung and earlier. The nonaligned states thus proved a 1970s version of the Indo-Sino
      <span>Paneh</span> <span>Shila</span>. In fact, the resolutions of the Lusaka
      conference linked this duty of collective self-reliance to the dictates of the U.N. Charter, interpreted as it
      had been by the third world since 1946.(<a href="#fn0190" id="bck_fn0190">8</a>) In this sense
      "collective self-reliance" represented a step toward unifying the positions on ethics taken by
      different third world states in the sixties. The poorest third world states moved back toward the long-standing
      new order position.
    </p>
<p>
      Yet "collective self-reliance" did little to resolve the ideological differences among third world
      nations, at first. The roots of the notion, the models of collective self-reliance praised both by third world
      officials and by scholars in 1970, hardly appealed to nonsocialist third world states or to those with
      outward-oriented economic policies. The nonaligned states took China and Yugoslavia to be examples of nations
      that had achieved self-reliant development.(<a href="#fn0191" id="bck_fn0191">9</a>)
      "Self-reliance" had been given a stronger ideological form in the democratic socialist program of
      Tanzania, the Arusha Declaration, <a id="page_96"></a>which proposed a Spartan sort of development centered
      around self-reliant village collectives.(<a href="#fn0192" id="bck_fn0192">10</a>) The single
      most cited example of international, collective self-reliance in 1970 was the railroad connecting Zambia and
      Tanzania. It was built not with the expensive technical assistance and vast capital outlays of a northern
      bilateral aid program or of a U.N. project, but with the aid of Chinese work teams living in Africa in a style
      little better than that of their African hosts.(<a href="#fn0193" id="bck_fn0193">11</a>) From
      the point of view of a development planner in (say) Brazil or Iran in 1970, collective self-reliance looked like
      an inward turning, autarkic program compatible, at best, with the minimal requirements of a barely developing
      national economy. Indeed when Tanzania's Julius Nyerere stated his nation's development ideology he
      emphasized that his country could not become a mass-consumption industrial society in the forseeable future,, a
      view that the leaders of wealthier third world states rarely offered in an analysis of their own
      countries.(<a href="#fn0194" id="bck_fn0194">12</a>)
    </p>
<p>
      In 1970 the fundamental differences in economic interests perceived by the more- and less-wealthy third world
      states remained. The notion of collective self-reliance would only come to help bridge the ideological rift when
      wealthier third world states started to push for aid to the least developed.
    </p>
<h2 id="ht0024"><a href="#bck_ht0024">The Third World Reunited</a></h2>
<p>
      During the 1971 autumn session of the General Assembly the wealthier southern states did push for a more direct
      identification of the LLDCs. The General Assembly ordered all U.N. agencies to come up with special plans for
      aiding those states, plans that were to be "comprehensive" and "action oriented."(<a href="#fn0195" id="bck_fn0195">13</a>) This turned out to be just one example of the increasing
      third world unity during that session.
    </p>
<p>
      The long-term dynamics of the global economic system established at the end of the second world war assured that
      third world governments would have reason to reconstruct their unity. The system generated problems that made the
      U.S. government adopt a new economic policy in August of 1971. The problems that southern nations believed the
      policy would create for them generated the south's renewed unity.
    </p>
<p>
      Ostensively, the American decisions had nothing to do with third world issues. American policy makers were trying
      to improve the position of their economy relative to economies of other developed market states. The most
      dramatic, if not the most substantive, part of the new U.S. policy involved severing the last link between the
      value of the dollar and gold. That was enough to make even the popular press see a transformation of the <a id="page_97"></a>international economic system.(<a href="#fn0196" id="bck_fn0196">14</a>)
      Nevertheless, the new policy was not designed to usher in a new international economic order. In fact, it was
      enacted when it was in order to save the economic system from greater crisis.(<a href="#fn0197" id="bck_fn0197">15</a>)
    </p>
<p>
      The immediate problem the Americans faced in 1971 was a massive trade deficit, primarily to western Europe. The
      trade deficit added to the long-standing payments deficit the U.S. had with its developed partners. Earlier,
      American imports from developed countries and American export of capital to them had facilitated economic growth
      in Europe and Japan. Likewise, American payments deficits were, in a sense, integral to the system because they
      assured that the international currency, dollars, was available in the volume needed for trade. Dollars could be
      used to be used to buy goods from any state. Foreign holders of dollars could safely refuse to spend them
      immediately on goods that could be purchased only in the U.S. because currencies remained convertible. In fact,
      if need be, foreign holders of dollars could convert them into gold through the U.S. government.
    </p>
<p>
      At the very beginning of the Bretton Woods system's regular operation, in the late fifties, the
      convertibility of dollars into gold was an especially important part of what made the system work. It meant that
      the dollar, and each of the currencies that could be converted into the dollar, was backed by a relatively stable
      measure of value. Merchants from all countries could feel secure while engaging in international trade because
      the money they had a money they could trust. Trade expanded and triggered economic growth that benefited many
      nations. Not the least of the benefits went to the U.S., whose trade expanded to provide the capital equipment
      needed for the economic recovery of the formerly-developed states.(<a href="#fn0198" id="bck_fn0198">16</a>)
    </p>
<p>
      After the Japanese and western European economies reached the same mass production levels as the U.S. economy,
      the benefits of this system to the U.S. started to diminish. Western European and Japanese interest in purchasing
      American goods failed to grow as quickly as before. Foreign markets for American goods could have expanded had
      the U.S.'s major trading partners revalued their currencies upward against the dollar, making American goods
      relatively cheaper. Markets also could have expanded had the U.S. devalued the dollar. But the Bretton Woods
      institutions provided no easy means for forcing the relevant governments to adopt either of these policies. The
      IMF could recommend that (say) the Germans or the Japanese revalue their currencies, but the IMF had no power to
      enforce the recommendation. Nations with strong currencies hardly needed the balance of payments loans the IMF
      provided. The IMF was equally powerless relative to the U.S. It could not force the U.S. to <a id="page_98"></a>devalue the dollar the same way it could "force" any other debtor state, by offering
      loans with devaluation as part of the quid pro quo. The "values" of various currencies the IMF actually
      could attempt to devalue were stated, in large part, in U.S. dollars. The Bretton Woods system itself had to
      change if there were to be a U.S. devaluation because the American currency was not merely a national currency
      with a value that could be freely changed against an international standard; it was the international standard,
      as much as the gold it was convertible into. The American Treasury's valuation of dollars relative to other
      currencies thus served two functions. It not only defined the value of the currency that could be used to buy
      American goods, it provided the international standard of value for all currencies.
    </p>
<p>
      By 1971 the American government had come to see these two goals as contradictory. Domestic economic interest, in
      reducing the trade deficit, demanded that the U.S. devalue the dollar. International economic stability seemed to
      depend on the U.S. accepting an overvalued dollar. This contradiction assured that some aspect of the postwar
      system would change. The Nixon administration did not decide to scrap the Bretton Woods system in 1971; that
      would have been the much greater crisis that the government wanted to avoid. Nonetheless, the administration
      attempted, successfully, to force other DMCs to renegotiate some of the fundamental principles of Bretton Woods.
    </p>
<p>
      The unilateral U.S. action was designed to do one of the things the IMF could not do to ease the U.S. trade
      deficit. The U.S. decisions were not aimed at removing the dollar as an international standard of value, which
      would have been one way to approach the problem. Rather, the U.S. aim was to force new exchange rates between the
      dollar and the currencies of America's major trading partners, to make U.S. goods less expensive
      abroad.(<a href="#fn0199" id="bck_fn0199">17</a>) Removing the convertibility of the dollar to
      gold forced those holding dollars abroad to seek another way of being sure their dollars continued to hold value.
      The easiest way was to let the value of the U.S. dollar relative to other convertible currencies be more freely
      determined by international money markets and by new financial agreements among the DMCs. Because there was an
      impetus to value the dollar accurately relative to other currencies, the dollar was effectively devalued.
    </p>
<p>
      In order to encourage the adjustments in the trade and money policies of other DMCs that the effective
      devaluation of the dollar would require, the United States took some actions that, inadvertently, affected the
      LDCs as well. In addition to suspending dollar-gold convertibility, the U.S. government announced across the
      board tariff increases of 10 percent on goods coming into the U.S.(<a href="#fn0200" id="bck_fn0200">18</a>) Third world products became more expensive to Americans; third world income from
      trade was bound to <a id="page_99"></a>fall.
    </p>
<p>
      And the effective devaluation of the dollar, itself, hurt third world economies. Dollars that the LDCs received
      from the multilateral aid agencies and the IMF were devalued so that, in real terms, aid decreased rapidly. By
      mid-1972, dollars purchased significantly less in all DMCs other than the U.S. than they had a year
      before.(<a href="#fn0201" id="bck_fn0201">19</a>) It took significantly more of the dollars
      from a World Bank loan for Senegalese fishermen to buy Norwegian tackle. It took significantly more of the
      dollars from an IMF drawing for the Ivorian government to settle a debt in Marks to the West Germans. Of course,
      no increase in U.S. aid alleviated this problem of the decreased value of multilateral aid denominated in
      dollars. The point of the overall U.S. program was to make foreigners more interested in buying goods produced in
      the U.S. where the dollar in 1972 could still purchase most of what it could in 1971. In fact, rather than
      increasing U.S. aid in 1972, the government decreased it even in the "real" terms of its purchasing
      power in the U.S. alone.(<a href="#fn0202" id="bck_fn0202">20</a>)
    </p>
<p>
      The third world reaction to the new American economic policy was swift and negative. In 1970 third world
      delegates had dispensed with the general debate on economic matters at the fall U.N. session because the debates
      were so repetitive. Positions were known. There was nothing new to say. (<a href="#fn0203" id="bck_fn0203">21</a>) But the third world vigorously reentered the debate in September 1971.
    </p>
<p>
      During the fall 1971 General Assembly session southern delegates never contradicted each other's analysis of
      the economic decisions the American government had made in August. The third world argument can be separated into
      four parts, discussions of (1) the reasons for the American decision, (2) the role of the third world in
      alleviating American economic problems, (3) the regrettable consequences of the U.S. action that the south would
      have to suffer, and (4) the actions that should be taken in light of the American decisions.
    </p>
<p>
      Third world delegates argued that the ultimate reasons for the American decisions could be found in flaws in the
      Bretton Woods system, flaws that existed only because southern interests were not consulted when the system was
      created.(<a href="#fn0204" id="bck_fn0204">22</a>) This view justified increasing third world
      input into the decisions to restructure the IMF that would have to be made in wake of the American decisions. But
      the historical assertion was never backed by analysis of how the Bretton Woods system could have been any less
      flawed with third world input.
    </p>
<p>
      The Libyan and Iraqi delegates identified the more immediate cause of the American actions as the American
      payments deficit. The deficit had grown throughout the Indo-China War, they argued. It was caused by the war and
      by the vast cost of the U.S. military bases in Europe.(<a href="#fn0205" id="bck_fn0205">23</a>) The Libyans concluded that southern states <a id="page_100"></a>were not responsible
      for the economic problems of a developed nation when those problems were caused by such "foreign
      adventurism."(<a href="#fn0206" id="bck_fn0206">24</a>)
    </p>
<p>
      Complementing this analysis of the reasons for the American decisions, the Peruvians noted that southern states
      had, in fact, contributed to the American economy. Most third world states had trade deficits to the United
      States similar to the deficits the U.S. had to its developed trading partners. In addition, the south contributed
      through profits repatriated to American TNCs operating in third world countries, profits that, he argued,
      exceeded the new U.S. investment in the south.(<a href="#fn0207" id="bck_fn0207">25</a>) Egypt
      and Mexico reiterated this point about TNC profits flowing into the U.S.(<a href="#fn0208" id="bck_fn0208">26</a>) The Mexican delegate went so far as to illustrate that the U.S. was profiting from
      its developed trading partners in Europe in the same way. These three delegations described the United States as
      governed by people who would irrationally and unfairly make nations that had contributed to American economic
      vigor suffer for American economic setbacks, setbacks that had been caused by the "adventurism"
      discussed by Libya and Iraq.
    </p>
<p>
      Third world delegates saved their most vehement denunciation of the U.S. for predictions about the consequences
      of U.S. action. In light of the reduction of real American aid to the third world, the Philippine delegate
      predicted the immediate failure of the U.N.'s Second Development Decade.(<a href="#fn0209" id="bck_fn0209">27</a>) Most LDC spokesmen noted that American tariff surcharges would reduce the south's
      income from trade. The Nigerian delegate charged that as a result, African states would join Latin American
      states and some of the large nations of Asia as victims of high debt-servicing requirements, becoming debtors
      with loans they could never hope to pay unless development programs were reduced or halted.(<a href="#fn0210" id="bck_fn0210">28</a>) The Sudanese representative suggested another consequence of the
      American decision: Productivity was the key to development. Political instability assured lower productivity. And
      reductions in third world trade income assured political instability.(<a href="#fn0211" id="bck_fn0211">29</a>) In sum, the south held that the new American economic policy assured an abrupt
      slow-down in LDC development, and that was a global crisis.
    </p>
<p>
      To alleviate the problems they expected to arise because of the American policy, most third world ambassadors
      just reiterated old formulas. For Upper Volta, one of the world's poorest states by any economic measure,
      direct financial assistance from the U.S. to compensate for the trade lost due to American tariff increases was a
      practical and moral necessity.(<a href="#fn0212" id="bck_fn0212">30</a>) The Mexican
      ambassador, in contrast, said that Mexico would not make claims for damages to the Mexican economy that would
      occur because of decisions already made. Rather, Mexico demanded creation of a global monetary system that would
      prevent nations from getting into the economic <a id="page_101"></a>straits that the U.S. had found itself in in
      the first place.(<a href="#fn0213" id="bck_fn0213">31</a>) While the Mexican delegate
      continued the tradition of the more conservative, older third world states and refused to argue for restitution
      the way African states did, he did so only in order to frame a more radical demand for restructuring the monetary
      order. Following the Mexican theme, the Egyptian delegate argued that, of course, the new monetary order would
      include the Link between international provisions of liquidity and foreign aid.(<a href="#fn0214" id="bck_fn0214">32</a>)
    </p>
<p>
      In contrast to the long-standing third world programs offered by other states, Libya suggested a new departure.
      The Libyan government argued that it was time that the third world used its dormant capacity to influence raw
      material prices in order to change the world economy. This was a notion that the third world had long approved in
      theory, but that few governments practiced.(<a href="#fn0215" id="bck_fn0215">33</a>)
    </p>
<p>
      Throughout 1970 and 1971 Libya had moved to nationalize all stages of domestic oil exploration and production.
      The government then used its power over traditional consumers of Libyan oil to raise its price. (<a href="#fn0216" id="bck_fn0216">34</a>) At the U.N. Libya merely suggested that its example be
      followed by other third world states. After all, DMCs seemed not to realize the continuing contribution of LDCs
      to DMC wealth. DMC governments failed to consider how the repatriated profits of TNCs helped the north. And the
      north failed to recognize the role played by the decline of DMC raw material prices relative to those of
      manufactured goods from the developed countries. According to Libya, southern states had every reason to follow
      its example, to nationalize those firms they had the power to nationalize and to raise the commodity prices they
      had the power to raise.
    </p>
<p>
      In sum, the American decisions provided an impetus for recreating third world unity and, ultimately, for
      reestablishing a unified third world ideology. For all practical purposes the unity of the Group of 77 was
      reestablished by the end of the General Assembly's 1971 session when the group made the assembly pass
      concrete proposals for providing U.N. aid to the LLDCs. But the ideological basis of that unity remained a bit
      tenuous.
    </p>
<p>
      A rapid progression of international conferences on economic matters, called long before the American decisions,
      maintained the impetus toward greater unity and built momentum from late 1971 through 1974. In October 1971,
      while the U.N. debates about the global economy continued in New York, meetings of the Group of 77's regional
      subgroups covered the same topics in Addis Ababa, Bangkok, and Lima. At each conference delegates upbraided the
      U.S. for its decisions. In the African view the U.S. was trying to force the south to solve northern economic
      problems.(<a href="#fn0217" id="bck_fn0217">35</a>) At Lima the Latin American states agreed
      upon new extensions of the old notions of states' <a id="page_102"></a>economic rights and duties. Henceforth
      the economic rights of states included a state's right to demand removal of obstacles to its development when
      those obstacles were imposed by other states. The Lima conference considered American tariff surcharges examples
      of such obstacles. The Latin Americans extended the duties of states to include a specific duty of wealthy states
      to solve their payments problems without hurting the economies of poorer states.(<a href="#fn0218" id="bck_fn0218">36</a>)
    </p>
<p>
      When the Group of 77 met together in November, the Latin American position on new economic rights and duties
      became the view of the group as a whole. This added a new element to the shared ideology, the notion of a
      nation's "right to develop." In practical terms the LDCs used the "right to develop" as
      an overarching justification for all the conflicting positions about the wealthy nations' "duties to
      aid." The new right implied that states seeking a self-reliant development path had the right to expect that
      developed states would not oppose actions taken toward that end — nationalizations and restrictions on trade and
      investment.(<a href="#fn0219" id="bck_fn0219">37</a>) The south also used the right to develop
      to demand that developed states anticipate and facilitate the movement of some industries, including textile and
      clothing manufacturing, to the LDCs. This later policy was first proposed at the Asian states' meeting at
      Bangkok.(<a href="#fn0220" id="bck_fn0220">38</a>) Finally, this new principle, like the
      earlier versions of the third world ethic for international economic relations, implied a right of all nations to
      live under a world economic system that did not impede their specific national development plans. Thus, not
      surprisingly, although this notion had first been raised to frame grievances with the specific problems that the
      breakdown of the Bretton Woods system caused for Latin America, only a month after the idea was first raised the
      Group of 77 used it to justify fundamentally new policies, simply because those policies were integral to the
      development plans of a few nations that were part of the group.
    </p>
<p>
      Surprisingly, though, despite third world resentment of the new American economic policy and despite the Libyan
      precedent, the Group of 77 joint meeting placed little emphasis on exploiting DMC economic vulnerabilities in
      order to achieve LDC goals. The group's position on tactics remained the commitment to influence public and
      elite opinion in the DMCs.(<a href="#fn0221" id="bck_fn0221">39</a>) Nonetheless, by the end
      of 1971 many group members had made their dissatisfaction with this approach very clear. At the end of the three
      regional meetings only the Asians went on record supporting the tactic.(<a href="#fn0222" id="bck_fn0222">40</a>) During the U.N. debate in October only Uruguay made proposals along these lines,
      urging UNESCO to mobilize public opinion to support developing states.(<a href="#fn0223" id="bck_fn0223">41</a>)
    </p>
<p>
      At the third UNCTAD meeting in the spring of 1972 the group supported stronger affirmations of the right of
      <a id="page_103"></a>individual states to control natural resources.(<a href="#fn0224" id="bck_fn0224">42</a>) But the south did not stop trying to convince the elites and publics of developed
      states to accept responsibilities toward poorer states. Nonetheless, the one resolution passed on the subject did
      little more than praise the press briefing given by UNCTAD officials before the conference.(<a href="#fn0225" id="bck_fn0225">43</a>)
    </p>
<p>
      In part the new, more militant tone of the group at UNCTAD III can be explained by the conference's location.
      Some observers from the DMCs have suggested that Santiago, the capital of Salvador Allende's newly elected
      Marxist government, attracted the most radical staff members from third world economic ministries, people
      interested in observing the experiment in social change going on in Chile.(<a href="#fn0226" id="bck_fn0226">44</a>) Since global economic meetings were so frequent in the early seventies, younger, more
      radical staffers could easily have won the right to go to Santiago. For that reason northern delegates took the
      debates in Santiago with a grain of salt. Yet, UNCTAD Ill's resolutions came to be a model for later third
      world positions rather than a more militant exception.
    </p>
<p>
      No doubt Santiago, with its Marxist government, influenced the south's position at least indirectly.
      Throughout March and April of 1972 the world press reported stories of the earlier unsuccessful attempts of the
      American C.I.A. and the American transnational corporation I.T.T. to prevent Allende's election. Stories
      about continuing attempts to destabilize his regime appeared as well, implicating other corporations, other
      branches of the U.S. government, and even the World Bank.(<a href="#fn0227" id="bck_fn0227">45</a>) Had UNCTAD III been held at another time or on the other side of the globe, few third
      world officials would have had reason to reflect on the Chilean experience. In Santiago they did reflect on the
      power transnationals in cooperation with their home governments wielded over third world states. Perhaps the new
      third world emphasis on using their own power to control transnational firms and raw materials can be explained
      by that reflection.
    </p>
<p>
      By the end of 1972 even the more conservative Latin American states were making more radical statements about the
      world economy than they ever had before. The catchphrase of that autumn's U.N. debate was "collective
      economic security." Uruguay called for "collective economic security" to be the fundamental
      principle of the new, post-Bretton Woods economic system that the United Nations should create.(<a href="#fn0228" id="bck_fn0228">46</a>) "Collective economic security" implied that
      third world states had to unite their powers to assure that their "right to develop" was respected. In
      that sense, "collective economic security" started as a Latin American version of "collective
      self-reliance." The 1972 General Assembly economic debate had only two major themes, "collective
      economic security" and the "new economic order" it implied.
    </p>
<p>
<a id="page_104"></a>Throughout the debate third world states praised themselves for working to achieve
      collective economic security. Peru noted that almost all members of the Group of 77 granted tariff preferences to
      the LLDCs. The Peruvian delegate praised the formation of the Andean Pact for the same reason. The pact created a
      south American alliance aimed at more stringent monitoring and control of foreign investment.(<a href="#fn0229" id="bck_fn0229">47</a>) The spokesman for the United Arab Emirates affirmed that the oil
      producing states shared the same problems that other raw material producers faced. For that reason, he said, the
      oil producers would continue to aid poorer third world nations.(<a href="#fn0230" id="bck_fn0230">48</a>) Many governments assured each other that it had been the unity of the third world
      that had forced the north to accept what the south identified as the only significant reform in the IMF since the
      U.S. decisions in 1971 had certified the beginning of the end of Bretton Woods. The developed nations allowed
      their caucus in the IMF, the Group of 10, to be expanded to "the Group of 20," including ten third
      world members, in inner councils where substantive reform of the monetary system was discussed.(<a href="#fn0231" id="bck_fn0231">49</a>)
    </p>
<p>
      At the same time, in 1972 the LDCs continued to discuss what a new economic order dedicated to "collective
      security" and earlier versions of their principles would look like. Most of the south's proposals had
      been heard before, and the few innovations followed directly from what had been proposed before. Chile argued
      that the global economic system should truly be made global by including eastern Europe and China.(<a href="#fn0232" id="bck_fn0232">50</a>) The Mexican delegate reiterated this position, using the
      opportunity to stress that the Soviet Union's economic duties to poorer states were very similar to those of
      the United States. Finally, the Mexican ambassador closed by extending the global aid doctrine that had been
      proposed by La Guardia in 1946. Mexico called for a global progressive income tax on nations. The duties of
      wealthy nations to poorer nations would be specified and vary with per capita wealth. And the relative financial
      needs of poorer states would be pinpointed the same way.(<a href="#fn0233" id="bck_fn0233">51</a>)
    </p>
<p>
      By the end of 1972 official pronouncements indicated as great a conscious unity among the LDCs as had existed in
      the mid-1960s. Yet many divisions remained below the surface. Unity had been achieved at the expense of advancing
      tactics beyond what they had been in 1967. "Collective economic security" symbolized a radicalization
      of the position taken by the more conservative third world states, but when translated into practical proposals
      for changing the international system "collective economic security" provided no more significant new
      policy directions for the Group of 77 as a whole than "collective self-reliance" had for the nonaligned
      states. Even though third world leaders discussed the creation of a global economic system that <a id="page_105"></a>would periodically redistribute wealth to poorer states, their proposals to achieve that goal had
      existed for years. The redistribution could happen through commodity agreements, increased aid, or the proposed
      Link, as well as through a global income tax on nations. But the third world position still lacked a coherent
      strategy for making any of these proposals a reality. Developing such a strategy would be difficult. Despite
      professions of third world unity and the new reasons for that unity stemming from American economic policy,
      differences in economic interest from region to region in the third world remained. Each of the differing
      interests had to be satisfied, at least in part, during any transition to a new order so that third world unity
      would not be shattered by the process of transition itself. That is what made inventing such strategies so
      difficult.
    </p>
<h2 id="ht0025"><a href="#bck_ht0025">Theory as a Source of Unity</a></h2>
<p>
      Before 1970, outside the international conferences on economic matters and more isolated from the requirements of
      day-to-day foreign economic policy making, groups of third world scholars had developed economic analyses that
      would expand the range of tactics available to the south and help cement the ideological basis for third world
      unity during the crucial period in the early seventies. Theories of dependency and neocolonialism appeared in
      every third world region in the late sixties. These theories stressed similarities among third world states
      rather than differences. They helped LDCs understand the rise of transnational firms and and the existence of
      impediments to the transfer of technology, the major new economic problems experienced by the third world in
      Bretton Woods system's heyday. At the same time, the new theories arose from and remained compatible with the
      analysis of global trade problems and of the promise of industrialization which the south had long accepted.
    </p>
<p>
      Third world scholars developed neocolonialism and dependency theories as a challenge to the
      "modernization" framework developed in the north.(<a href="#fn0234" id="bck_fn0234">52</a>) Modernization theorists look to the examples of the European states, the Soviet
      Union, the United States, and Japan to prove that economic development is similar everywhere. They ask,
      "What should people in underdeveloped countries do to develop quickly?" Dependency theorists, in
      contrast, hold that the wealth of developed nations and the poverty of underdeveloped nations are both results of
      the same global process, an ongoing process that continues to produce development in some regions of the world
      and underdevelopment in others.
    </p>
<p>
      The dependency framework actually existed in the third world before the modernization framework was developed. In
      the 1950s scholars in the newly independent <a id="page_106"></a>states confronted a conventional wisdom which
      said that any local economic development would have to be structured by the export requirements and political
      whims of the colonial powers.(<a href="#fn0235" id="bck_fn0235">53</a>) Likewise,
      Prebisch's early analysis of development in Latin America emphasized the greater power of the developed
      center to control the global production system, which restricted Latin American development.
    </p>
<p>
      Nonetheless, in the 1950s and 1960s few third world governments would accept a development policy analysis
      emphasizing dependency alone. The most prominent third world scholars shared the official view that the south had
      some control over its development. Prebisch's ECLA in Latin America and influential economists from the new
      states, such as Caribbean economist W. Arthur Lewis, emphasized possibilities for autonomous development through
      their advocacy of import-substitution policies and, later, of regional economic integration.(<a href="#fn0236" id="bck_fn0236">54</a>) In Africa decolonization theorists, including Fanon and Memmi as well
      as the many national independence leaders who were scholars in their own right, concentrated upon gaining
      political independence and called it the key to economic independence. Fanon and Memmi even said that
      intellectuals who concentrated too much on economic dependence were raising psychological barriers to national
      development.(<a href="#fn0237" id="bck_fn0237">55</a>)
    </p>
<p>
      The emergent intellectual prominence of the dependency school in Latin America and the Caribbean and of studies
      of neocolonialism in Africa and other third world regions represented the legitimation of the dependency
      framework. In the late sixties dependency theorists became involved in the more official discourse on economic
      development, the discussion that went on in third world universities and United Nations research organizations.
    </p>
<p>
      In Africa the relegitimation of the dependency framework was relatively simple. Unlike Latin America states, few
      African governments developed a stake in defending the theories of economic modernization that deemphasized
      international structural constraints upon development. After decolonization African governments continued to
      emphasize the economic decisions made abroad that restricted African economic development — decisions made by (1)
      foreign consumers of African raw materials, (2) states and international agencies granting aid to the continent,
      and (3) potential foreign investors. Kwame Nkrumah's <span>Neocolonialism</span>, published
      in 1965, said that attempts to foster economic development through an open, outwardly-directed policy of
      encouraging foreign investment and exports was doomed. Nkrumah argued that the economies of developed capitalist
      states required exploitative world economic relations akin to colonialism to be continued after independence.
      Thus he appeared to repudiate the statement he had so often made before, a <a id="page_107"></a>sentiment shared
      by many other African independence leaders, that all else would follow once Africans had "seized the
      political kingdom."(<a href="#fn0238" id="bck_fn0238">56</a>) By 1970 the United Nations
      economic research unit in Africa, the Institute for Economic Planning and Development in Dakar, was promulgating
      the same thesis in the views of its Egyptian director, Marxist economist Samir Amin.(<a href="#fn0239" id="bck_fn0239">57</a>)
    </p>
<p>
      In Latin America and the Caribbean the official emphasis both of national governments and the U.N. research arm,
      ECLA, was more on finding economic modernization policies available to governments rather than on searching for
      all forms of independence. While questions associated with the dependency framework tended to be ignored in the
      western hemisphere until the mid-sixties, Prebisch's analysis of trade dependency continued to be a
      foundation of later ECLA views.(<a href="#fn0240" id="bck_fn0240">58</a>)
    </p>
<p>
      Further development of dependency ideas in Latin America began, according to dependency theorist Fernando
      Cardoso, when the failure of the modernization programs ECLA had advocated became clear. Import substitution and
      regional integration did not result in the type of development enjoyed by the societies that were the models of
      modernization.(<a href="#fn0241" id="bck_fn0241">59</a>) By 1965 ECLA economists were looking
      for new analyses of Latin American economies and, although the states that ECLA served did not support the
      development of dependency theory, the organization itself supported independent dependency scholars. In their
      view, histories of Latin American "dependency" could explain the failures of policies ECLA had
      advocated.
    </p>
<p>
      Norman Girvan and other Caribbean dependency theorists explain the relegitimation of their framework in their own
      region in the same way. Development policies influenced by the modernization framework had failed. Elements of
      the particular modernization theories that had been developed by local economists, especially Lewis, implied that
      dependency was real. Thus dependency ideas could easily be adopted by scholars in Caribbean universities and
      research institutes where research was officially directed toward solving development problems.(<a href="#fn0242" id="bck_fn0242">60</a>)
    </p>
<p>
      With the increasing legitimacy of the dependency framework came increasing legitimacy for specific historical
      explanations that many dependency theorists advocated. This analysis, in turn, entered the New International
      Economic Order ideology.
    </p>
<p>
      Between 1968 and 1970 dependency theorists in both Latin America and the Caribbean published analyses of the
      forms dependency had taken since the second world war. (<a href="#fn0243" id="bck_fn0243">61</a>) They emphasized the increasing significance of transnational firms. Such firms just
      represented the latest way that economies of developing states were transformed to serve the developed world.
      Dependency scholars unraveled the strings of dependency tied by TNCs. They distinguished the effects of profits
      <a id="page_108"></a>repatriated to TNC home countries from the effects of TNCs' monopolies of industrial
      technology and from the ways TNCs strengthened certain elites in developing countries. In sum, the dependency
      theorists argued that because TNCs had industrial monopolies, third world elites had to pay monopoly rents in
      order to get the technology needed for development. If a southern nation's elite encouraged development
      through TNC direct investment, the tendency of TNCs to repatriate would take away the development advantages. If
      the elite tried to buy industrial technologies, they would have to maintain the traditional export sector in
      order to obtain the large amount of foreign exchange needed to buy capital goods from TNCs abroad. Neither policy
      allowed real development, that is, the ability to leave a dependent position in the world economy.(<a href="#fn0244" id="bck_fn0244">62</a>)
    </p>
<p>
      After the American actions in 1971 — which by 1972 the U.N. Secretariat had directly linked to increased payments
      deficits in most LDCs — many third world officials adopted some of the dependency analysis of TNCs. They linked
      this analysis of TNCs to the problem of development programs becoming highly dependent on an increasingly
      difficult-to-maintain positive balance of payments. Third world states had to have payments surpluses in order to
      afford more capital goods from abroad. Southern officials placed this analysis under the moral rubric of
      states' duties to aid the economic development of other states. The 1972 Peruvian and Chilean U.N. delegates
      argued that corporations should be required to live under a code of conduct that would limit repatriated
      profits.(<a href="#fn0245" id="bck_fn0245">63</a>) The delegate from Uruguay argued that DMC
      governments should facilitate the direct transfer of technology and bypass TNCs.(<a href="#fn0246" id="bck_fn0246">64</a>) The U.N. Economic and Social Council adopted a resolution in June 1972 that
      triggered most of the U.N.'s subsequent investigations of TNCs and the transfer of technology. Subsequent
      U.N. studies reflected dependency analysis. They presented the rise of TNCs as a logical consequence of the
      postwar international economy. Poorer states that had few powers to control firms became victims, unlike the
      wealthier states (where most TNC investment actually occurs). In response, the U.N. proposed providing
      alternative sources of modern technology and improving the negotiating skills of third world officials who dealt
      with TNCs.
    </p>
<p>
      Dependency theory contributed much more to the new order ideology than an analysis of TNCs and the transfer of
      technology. More significant was the dependency theorists' concentration on global structures that affected
      all third world nations to the exclusion of analysis of regional differences in the third world. That emphasis
      contributed to third world unity.
    </p>
<p>
      The effectiveness of dependency theories in this regard is again related to their increasing legitimacy.
    </p>
<p>
<a id="page_109"></a>By 1970 dependency and neocolonialism theorists held prestigious jobs in universities in all
      third world regions as well as in the African and Latin American U.N. research arms.(<a href="#fn0247" id="bck_fn0247">65</a>) They used the resources of their professional positions to increase their
      contacts with those who shared the same perspective in other parts of the third world and in developed countries
      through individual meetings and conferences. In 1968, for example, Andre Gunder Frank, whose dependency ideas
      affected Latin America, met with Samir Amin.(<a href="#fn0248" id="bck_fn0248">66</a>) One
      conference among dependency scholars in 1972 resulted in a sort of textbook of dependency analysis, an issue of
      the West Indian journal <span>Social and Economic Studies</span>. All of the articles appeared
      in English, what Cardoso calls the "Latin" of contemporary world scholarship.(<a href="#fn0249" id="bck_fn0249">67</a>)
    </p>
<p>
      The international spread of dependency theory extended beyond the southern regions on either side of the
      Atlantic. Asian scholars and government officials, like their Atlantic counterparts, became disgruntled with
      modernization ideas of the 1960s. One of the foremost Asian policy analysts who changed his mind was Mahbub ul
      Haq, once planning minister of Pakistan and later World Bank vice president. His 1976 study. <span>The Poverty Curtain</span>, contains a compelling personal account of how he came to reject the
      modernization theories which had guided his unsuccessful planning.(<a href="#fn0250" id="bck_fn0250">68</a>)
    </p>
<p>
      Ul Haq personally contributed to the donscious unity of third world scholars behind the new order ideology. By
      1972 he, like the Latin American dependency theorists, felt that adherence to northern models of modernization by
      third world planners was a form of ideological dependence. He summarizes his thoughts then:
    </p>
<p>
      Should we [third world scholars] not establish our own institutions of intellectual self-reliance . . . which
      would give form and substance to our aimless search for appropriate development strategies at home and our
      disorganized efforts to coordinate our negotiating positions abroad?(<a href="#fn0251" id="bck_fn0251">69</a>)
    </p>
<p>
      With a group of other third world scholars in U.N. positions including Gamani Corea (Secretary General of
      UNCTAD), Enrique Inglesias, (Executive Secretary of ECLA), and Samir Amin, ul Haq created the Third World Forum
      in 1973, a group dedicated to "intellectual self-reliance."
    </p>
<p>
      The forum never became a major source of new dependency ideas: it simply supports the efforts of the south to
      gain the New International Economic Order. It never speaks out against the ruling elite of any developing state.
      It does not analyze class struggles within LDCs, although shifting class relations are the characteristics of
      dependency and neocolonialism that most interest those dependency theorists with fewer <a id="page_110"></a>government ties now, a decade after the forum was created.(<a href="#fn0252" id="bck_fn0252">70</a>)
    </p>
<p>
      The creation of the forum, nonetheless, brought part of the dependency framework into a significant position in
      the international debate. By agreeing to the forum's first statement in 1973, the directors of UNCTAD, ECLA,
      the U.N. Institute in Africa, and the most prominent Asian economist in the international organization system
      went on record affirming that all third world states shared the same international structural impediments to
      development.(<a href="#fn0253" id="bck_fn0253">71</a>) None of those agencies or individuals
      could have been expected to conduct or disseminate research that emphasized contradictory regional economic
      interests from that point forward.
    </p>
<p>
      In addition to providing a further basis for treating the LDCs' economic problems as a unit, dependency
      theorists directly helped to resolve the tactical dilemma faced by third world governments when they tried to
      find ways to change the international system. Positing strong systemic, rather than domestic, sources of
      development and underdevelopment reinforced the view that only fundamental changes in the international system
      would work. In the dependency theorists' view, the fact that some people in developed states actually
      benefited from the underdevelopment of other regions made it naive to expect DMC leaders to change the system in
      response to rational, moral arguments alone. In fact, some third world intellectuals such as Nigerian
      social-historian Chinweizu concluded that the south's concern with democratic procedures indicated
      ideological dependence on northern political theory as great as the ideological dependence that many southern
      economists had on northern modernization theory.(<a href="#fn0254" id="bck_fn0254">72</a>) As
      a result, by 1973 more aggressive approaches to convincing northern nations to change the global economic system
      became commonplaces of third world rhetoric. The resolutions of the September 1973 meeting of the nonaligned
      states in Algiers illustrate the trend. They decried "dependence and neocolonialism" arguing that
      ". . . the developing counties in general are still subject directly or indirectly to imperialist
      domination." The nonaligned states attacked "ideological domination" by the developed states and
      called for collective economic security measures. They even demanded that the scope of United Nations concerns
      with security should be expanded to include economic matters.(<a href="#fn0255" id="bck_fn0255">73</a>)
    </p>
<p>
      Surprisingly, the same views that contributed to this aggressive tone also indirectly provided third world
      officials with a stronger basis from which they could negotiate a new order with the north. The dependency
      theorists' concentration on finding impediments to development still affecting all third world states allowed
      third world leaders to resolve the differences between the few radical states that still affirmed the <a id="page_111"></a>restitution ethic and the other states that based their argument upon the permanent rights and
      duties of states.
    </p>
<p>
      Under the dependency framework governments of states which had long been independent could argue for restitution
      for current "exploitation," say by transnational firms, as easily as new states could. Older states
      could even link those claims to a colonialism that was long dead. Only the form of dependence, not its substance,
      had changed. When ul Haq was in the process of changing his views about development, he wrote one of the more
      entertaining explanations of this view as comment on <span>Partners in Development</span>
      requested by Barbara Ward. He noted that India had long been a "partner in development" with Britain.
      Throughout Britain's colonial rule India provided her with capital. Based on rough figures, with low interest
      rates, Britain "owed" India about half a trillion dollars in 1970. Of course, he said, Britain would be
      in no position to pay that, and India, concerned with stability in the world economy, would not want Britain to
      go broke trying to do so. Nonetheless, ul Haq had an imaginary northern friend who did not believe in
      renegotiating debts and would insist that Britain pay now. In contrast, ul Haq argued that the debt just
      indicated why Britain should take part in negotiating a more stable and fairer international economic order for
      the future.
    </p>
<p>
      Employing a more conventional dependency analysis, other leaders of older third world states adopted the same
      position. The Mexican government of Luis Echeverria used the "restitution duty" in 1971 and 1972 as an
      argument that northern states should approve the creation of an international Charter of Economic Rights and
      Duties of States.(<a href="#fn0257" id="bck_fn0257">75</a>) The working group that was to
      write the charter was approved by UNCTAD III in Santiago. The group was to derive the charter from prior
      principles — the UNCTAD trade principles of 1964, the 1968 Charter of Algiers, and the ideas about the right of
      every nation to develop agreed upon by the Group of 77 immediately before UNCTAD III.(<a href="#fn0258" id="bck_fn0258">76</a>) All of these principles pointed to an economic order bounded by the rights and
      duties of states first proposed in the 1940s. The actual charter reflected that ethic rather than the restitution
      ethic used to explain why the north should agree to the creation of the charter in the first place.(<a href="#fn0259" id="bck_fn0259">77</a>) The charter debates thus illustrate the place that was
      found for the restitution ethic in the new order ideology before 1974. It became just one reason why colonial and
      neocolonial northern states should negotiate toward the new order.
    </p>
<p>
      Thus, the reason ideas about dependency and neocolonialism were so rapidly included in the new order ideology in
      the early seventies was very simple. In one sense a dependency framework had always been the structure of the
      economic analysis proposed by third world governments in international meetings. Since the <a id="page_112"></a>forties, Asian, African, and Latin American delegates had said that optimal third world
      development was impeded by global economic structures neither created nor controlled by the third world itself.
      The adoption of the particular structural analysis of transnational firms and of the problems of technology
      transfer was facilitated by the fact that these were relatively new, relatively unstudied issues which bothered
      many third world states. Dependency theory provided a readily available explanation of these new problems without
      contradicting any other third world assumptions. The real frustrations that third world economic planners felt
      with northern models of development encouraged them to adopt the dependency framework as well. So did the felt
      need for the continued political unity of the third world, which could only be achieved by deemphasizing the
      economic differences among southern states and by finding a position for the different third world views about
      ethics in a unified ideology.
    </p>
<p>
      Dependency theory by itself did not convince southern policy makers to abandon northern economic models or
      reunify the principles underlying new order policy analysis. Active leadership had to turn the potential provided
      by dependency ideas into actual contributions to the third world alliance and its ideology. Ul Haq and other
      third world scholars, Echeverria and his government, and others all convinced members of the alliance to
      emphasize southern unity. The leaders used compelling arguments from the dependency framework: Third world
      intellectual life was ideologically dependent on the north. All third world states had experienced colonial
      dependence in the past and continued to experience neocolonial dependence today. These arguments, in turn, became
      part of the new order ideology.
    </p>
<h2 id="ht0026"><a href="#bck_ht0026">Leadership and the 1974 Nieo
    Program</a></h2>
<p>
      Intellectual and political leaders of the third world had further major effects on the emerging ideology in early
      1970s. The most dramatic example of effective third world leadership was Egypt's organization of Arab OPEC
      members to use the "oil weapon" as part of the Egyptian strategy in the October 1973 war against
      Israel. (<a href="#fn0260" id="bck_fn0260">78</a>) While the preconditions for this successful
      strategy — the existence of petroleum-dependent developed nations — were created in part by the success of the
      expanding global liberal economy, the direct target of the strategy was hardly the postwar economic system
      itself. The "oil weapon" was a tactic designed not to create the New International Economic Order, but
      to aid Egypt in its rapid strike against Israel. Nonetheless, the decision made by all OPEC members — <a id="page_113"></a>including Iran, a supporter of Israel — to raise the world price of oil soon after the Arab OPEC
      members had stopped oil sales to Israel's developed allies was reinforced by the Arab boycott. And the
      decision to raise prices was aimed at changing the world economy. As a result of the price increases and the
      disruption in the global system for allocating oil caused by the boycott, DMC governments became eager to to
      engage in discussions about "resource interdependence." To put it another way, DMCs were interested in
      discussing reform of some aspects of the postwar trade system because they themselves had experienced problems
      the system could not cope with and even helped generate. Self-selected leaders of the third world, in particular
      the governments of Algeria and Iran, seized the chance presented by the OPEC price increases to catalyze the
      Group of 77 to organize and present its long-standing demands in the most coherent and comprehensive way
      possible.
    </p>
<p>
      In January 1974 Honari Boumedienne, the president of Algeria, called upon the Secretary General of the United
      Nations to organize a special session of the General Assembly to discuss matters of raw material production,
      trade, and development.(<a href="#fn0261" id="bck_fn0261">79</a>) Boumedienne found himself in
      an unusually strong position to make such a request. He was president of one of the more radical Arab oil states
      and thus the target of DMC requests that the oil issue be discussed internationally. He was also the official,
      temporary leader of the nonaligned states. Leadership passed to the local head of government in the country where
      the group's last meeting had taken place. In 1974 the Algerians took an unusual step by employing some of the
      power inherent in what was meant to be a purely routine position by making their request in the name of the
      nonaligned movement.
    </p>
<p>
      The request for a General Assembly session found immediate support not only from the nonaligned states but from
      all other members of the Group of 77 as well as the DMC governments. The U.N. Secretary General was ready to call
      the session immediately. He delayed only because the Group of 77 asked that it be postponed until the group could
      meet and prepare a more detailed positions.(<a href="#fn0262" id="bck_fn0262">80</a>)
    </p>
<p>
      The story of the group's consultations between February and April 1974 has yet to be told in detail. It will
      probably be a very dull one. Yet the result was something that appeared to be fundamentally new — a defiant call
      for international trade, finance, and monetary systems that would amend or replace those that were already
      existing. In substance, though, all the proposals for the NIEO, all the economic analysis offered by the Group of
      77 at the Sixth Special Session of the General Assembly, and all the principles underlying that analysis were
      quite old. The two months between the time the Secretary General wanted to meet and the time the conference
      actually began was a little less than the time <a id="page_114"></a>usually needed to conduct the regional
      meetings and full Group of 77 meeting before the more routine UNCTADs. Few new issues could have encumbered the
      group's deliberations.

      One that certainly did was the adverse effects that the OPEC price hikes were bound to have in the third world.
      As one U.N. official puts it "anti-imperialism" assured that the third world supported the OPEC
      action.(<a href="#fn0263" id="bck_fn0263">81</a>) And if that was not enough, members of the
      group could rely upon an Iranian proposal that the OPEC states manifest the duty incumbent upon them with their
      new wealth by aiding the states most seriously affected by the price increases.(<a href="#fn0264" id="bck_fn0264">82</a>)
    </p>
<p>
      What was new at the Sixth Special Session was the discipline Group of 77 members showed in their support of the
      NIEO "Declaration and Programme of Action." A few group members, particularly Iran and Algeria, guided
      the debate. The Iranian delegation made many of both the substantive and procedural motions and, more than any
      other single delegation, responded to northern objections to the new order program.
    </p>
<p>
      The Sixth Special Session did not turn out to be the substantive debate on the oil question that the DMCs wanted.
      In a limited sense, it was quite the opposite. The meeting served to legitimate OPEC price actions by having them
      approved by the assembly as a whole. That, no doubt, was one of the Algerian and Iranian goals. More
      significantly, for the first time the General Assembly approved a massive resolution covering all of the economic
      issues the third world had raised since the second world war. The resolution touched on sovereignty over national
      resources, improving terms of trade through international regulation of trade based on equitable treatment,
      reforming the global monetary system to include an aid component, expanding concessionary multilateral aid,
      providing debt relief, controlling ΤNTCs, promoting international support for industrialization, and reforming
      the United Nations system to give third world governments greater control over international economic decisions.
      When presented together, the proposals outlined a very different order than the one that existed in 1974.
    </p>
<p>
      Despite the fact that the new order proposals of spring 1974 were internally coherent and covered all third world
      issues, they could hardly become "one of the most important bases for relations between all peoples and
      nations" as they claimed they would. The proposals did not include sympathetic responses to the specific DMC
      concerns with monetary problems and resource vulnerabilities which had been exposed so recently. Rather, leaders
      of the third world had simply used the opportunity given by the growing DMC concern with its resource dependence
      — the willingness of DMC governments to hold a special session on resource matters — in order <a id="page_115"></a>to reiterate the south's position and make it more widely known.
    </p>
<p>
      Likewise, at the regular General Assembly session in the fall of 1974 leaders of the third world continued to use
      their limited powers to assure that the south's position was fully, coherently presented. General Assembly
      routine gave Algeria the presidency that year. Daniel Patrick Moynihan argues that the Algerians used the chair
      to railroad the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States over DMC objections, again eschewing substantive
      debate on the sort of new international economic system that was possible.(<a href="#fn0265" id="bck_fn0265">83</a>) The charter, the result of Echeverría's initiative in 1972, was the most explicit
      and comprehensive statement of new order principles in a decade. It completed the statement of the new order
      program begun with the NIEO declaration in the spring.
    </p>
<p>
      The leaders of the third world who helped bring about these statements — Boumedienne, Echeverria and their
      governments, other OPEC governments, and some Arab states — did so for their own reasons. Personal, domestic, and
      regional interests played as much a role for them as the goals of the third world alliance. What Yoram Shapira
      says of Echeverria can be applied equally well to the others. Echeverria came to the U.N. in 1971 to publicize
      attacks on the trade restrictions imposed by the new American economic policy, and he argued for the charter in
      Santiago because, as Shapira says, Echeverria
    </p>
<p>
      . . . perceived a radical transformation of the international system as necessary for furnishing a solution to
      domestic problems and a national malaise.(<a href="#fn0266" id="bck_fn0266">84</a>)
    </p>
<p>
      The leaders of the third world retained more specific allegiances to their own nations. They organized third
      world reaction to the signs of breakdown in the Bretton Woods system — the U.S. decisions in 1971, the DMCs'
      oil vulnerabilities — in order to advance international changes they considered important to their national
      interests. Third world leaders in the early seventies were not selected by some sort of competitive politics
      within the alliance because of their special commitment to alliance goals. They selected themselves. The leaders
      were those governments that took the opportunities offered by the evolving politics of international economic
      relations to create leadership roles for themselves. Those opportunities occurred both because the third world
      alliance itself had evolved so that, for example, the apparent leader of the nonaligned movement had some clout,
      and because unintended consequences of the expanding postwar global economy had created some specific ways in
      which the north was vulnerable to third world power.
    </p>
<h2 id="ht0027"><a id="page_116"></a><a href="#bck_ht0027">Responses to Northern
    Initiatives</a></h2>
<p>
      Some DMC scholars and policy makers linked those unintended consequences of postwar growth that they first felt
      in the early seventies to global issues broader than the inadequacy of the gold-dollar based monetary system or
      the vulnerability of mass-production economies that used foreign oil. In the early seventies northern scholars
      rediscovered "resource limits to growth" and logically and emotionally linked them to the subsequent
      oil shortages created by the oil weapon and the OPEC price increases.(<a href="#fn0267" id="bck_fn0267">85</a>) Northerners brought problems associated with these "limits" to
      international conferences as early as the U.N. conference on the environment held at Stockholm in 1972. Northern
      spokesmen argued strongly that environmental pollution coming from increasing industrialization was a global
      problem. Later, directly after the Sixth Special Session, a U.N. conference on population met. There, northern
      spokesmen linked rapid population growth to an increasingly rapid approach to global resource limits.
    </p>
<p>
      The immediate implications of both of these arguments were detrimental to the south's new order position.
      Even so, many of the original limits-to-growth scholars had advocated redistribution of the world's
      wealth.(<a href="#fn0268" id="bck_fn0268">86</a>) But the existence of environmental limits to
      growth could imply that new industrialization in the unindustrialized third world should be stopped. And when the
      population problem was seen as a global issue it implied that population control rather than industrialization
      should be the first priority of third world development.
    </p>
<p>
      In response to these issues third world scholars promulgated analyses of world society suggesting that the
      environmental consequences of third world development and the south's population problem were minor. In doing
      so these scholars expanded the new order ideology to include answers to problems that had first been relevant
      only to developed states. While the initial southern answers were not all that sympathetic to northern concerns,
      for the first time the new order ideology was dealing with "global" problems first perceived by the
      north as such in addition to the "global" problems that only the ideology's southern adherents
      felt.
    </p>
<p>
      Environmental degradation appeared as a "limits to growth" problem of the seventies before the
      population question did. In fact, ul Haq's experiment in "intellectual self-reliance," the Third
      World Forum, began as a response to northern concerns with environmental limits to growth, to the exclusion of
      development, at Stockholm.(<a href="#fn0269" id="bck_fn0269">87</a>) But the LDC view rapidly
      moved closer to the northern position taken there. In <a id="page_117"></a>1972 the nonaligned states took the
      position that environmental control was not a problem relevant to third world states except to the degree that
      environmental controls might imply "... additional costs of development ... for developing
      countries."(<a href="#fn0270" id="bck_fn0270">88</a>) By 1973 the south was stating this
      concern as an incidence of states' economic rights and duties:
    </p>
<p>
      The heads of State or Government of nonaligned countries stress that environmental measures adopted by one state
      should not adversely affect the environment of other states, or zones outside their jurisdiction.(<a href="#fn0271" id="bck_fn0271">89</a>)
    </p>
<p>
      This peculiar article repeated the language of the demand more frequently heard in the north that one
      country's pollution should not be allowed to adversely affect other countries. Apparently the cost of
      cleaning up pollution remained the nonaligned states' major concern. Nonetheless at the same conference the
      nonaligned states affirmed:
    </p>
<p>
      Any infringement of the right of effective control by any state over its national resources and their
      exploitation by means suited to its own situation, <span>having respect for the ecological
      balance</span>, is contrary to the alms and principles of the United Nations Charter and hampers the development
      of international cooperation . . . [emphasis added]
    </p>
<p>
      In responding to a northern issue, the issue itself, international principles to maintain the environment, became
      part of the NIEO ideology. Ultimately, the issue was reflected in Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States
      as its final operative article (#30)<span>:</span>
</p>
<p>
      The protection, preservation, and enhancement of the environment for the present and future generations is the
      responsibility of all States. All States shall endeavor to establish their own environmental and development
      policies in conformity with such responsibility . . . All states should cooperate in evolving international norms
      and regulations in the field of the environment.(<a href="#fn0271a" id="bck_fn0271a">90</a>)
    </p>
<p>
      This article contains the only principles of states ' economic rights and duties not found previously in the
      1964 UNCTAD principles, the 1968 Charter of Algiers, or the principles advocated by the Group of 77 immediately
      before UNCTAD III. It is a "northern" principle integrated into the south's ethic.
    </p>
<p>
      The story of the population issue is quite different. The northern concern with limiting population <a id="page_118"></a>growth in order to slow the rush toward global economic limits was rejected by third world
      governments as a whole, just as the previous emphasis on population control in the Pearson Report had been. The
      1974 population conference approved a "World Population Plan of Action" dedicated to economic
      development, not to population control. As the plan's objectives state:
    </p>
<p>
      Population policies are constituent elements of socio-economic development policies, never substitutes for
      them.(<a href="#fn0272" id="bck_fn0272">91</a>)
    </p>
<p>
      Third world intellectual leaders, joined by northern supporters, turned the emphasis on population control aside
      more directly. "The Cocoyoc Declaration" of a U.N. conference called in Mexico under the direction of
      Barbara Ward and including forum members Amin, Corea, and ul Haq concluded:
    </p>
<p>
      A North American child or European child, on average, consumes outrageously more than his Indian or African
      counterpart — a fact which makes it specious to attribute pressure on world resources entirely to the growth of
      Third World population.(<a href="#fn0273" id="bck_fn0273">92</a>)
    </p>
<p>
      Thus, the concern for population control never became part of the new order ideology.
    </p>
<p>
      Perhaps the contrasting ways the LDCs reacted to these two northern issues in the early 1970s can be explained by
      the intellectual merits of the northern arguments alone. There is certainly little basis for the assumption that
      population growth in the LDCs will cause us to quickly approach resource limits to growth, at least as long as
      the global distribution of wealth remains as it is now. One the other hand, there is little reason to expect that
      third world industrialization will contribute much to world pollution unless the pace of industrialization
      increases markedly. And third world population growth would make us rapidly approach resource limits if it
      continued after a new, more equitable world order was realized.
    </p>
<p>
      The real explanation for the different ways new order advocates handled these northern issues involves more than
      the relative merits of the the arguments. It has to do with the compatibility of each issue with prior third
      world opinions. Environmental regulation could be seen as a duty of resource owners under the third world ethic.
      Population control, perhaps, might have been seen as a similar duty of states. But the north had previously
      proposed population control as a universally valid development policy. That represented a violation of the
      general principle of a state's right to choose its own development path. Population control for development
      can <a id="page_119"></a>never become a third world position as long as some individual third world states have
      cultural or religious opposition to contraception, because each state has a right to such opposition according to
      the south views of the rights and duties of states.
    </p>
<p>
      Despite the LDC rejection of the population issue, the major story of emergent NIEO ideology in the first half of
      the seventies was still one of "northern" issues — the economic problems of developed states, the
      reactions of their governments to those problems, and the reaction of the south to northern actions.
    </p>
<p>
      In the short-term there is no doubt that the most dramatic action taken by any of the developing states in the
      early seventies, the oil price increases, only made northern problems worse, just as the price increases made the
      immediate economic problems for most southern states much worse. And the NIEO program itself offered nothing to
      solve the monetary and trade problems the north experienced. Nonetheless, if only with the environmental issue,
      third world governments did demonstrate the ability to accept some northern issues as their own. This was an
      especially important development. If the new order program was to have anything approaching the significance that
      the south expected in 1974, it would have to deal with northern problems as well as southern ones. Despite the
      grand rhetoric at the Sixth Special Session, a working new order would have to be supported by the developed
      nations.

    The Debate Since 1974</a></h1>
<p>
        If history is to be our guide, I believe that we may be on the threshold of a historical turning point. On the
        national level such a turning point was reached in the United States in the 1930s when the New Deal elevated
        the working class to partners in development and accepted them as an essential part of the consuming society.
        On the international level we have still not arrived at the philosophical breakthrough when the development of
        the poor nations is considered an essential element in the sustained development of the rich nations and their
        interests are regarded as complementary and compatible, not conflicting and irreconcilable. And yet we may be
        nearing that philosophical bridge.
      </p>
<p>
        — Mahbub ul Haq, 1975
      </p>
<p>
        The world economic system of the last three decades has ceased to work effectively. We all believe it needs
        urgent and major reforms and restructuring.
      </p>
<p>
        -- Willy Brandt, 1979(<a href="#fn0274" id="bck_fn0274">1</a>)
      </p>
<p>
      Substantive north-south debate over how to restructure the international economic order could begin only after
      the kind of turning point ul Haq expected in 1975. Only then would both north and south worry about convincing
      the other side, yet be interested enough in agreement to remain open to being convinced themselves. That is the
      attitude needed in any substantive debate.(<a href="#fn0275" id="bck_fn0275">2</a>)
    </p>
<p>
      The development of both northern and southern views after 1974 should show if the turning point has been reached.
      Parties in a substantive political debate change their views in response to each other's concerns. If ul Haq
      is right, sometime after 1974 we would expect to see changes in the NIEO ideology resulting from both the
      south's serious consideration of the north's views and <a id="page_126"></a>the south<sup>'</sup>s responses to the north's serious consideration of its own views.
    </p>
<p>
      To use David Apter's ideas about mobilizing ideologies, ul Haq's turning point would occur when the north
      recognized that the south would have to be involved in order for global economic regimes to be reformed in the
      way the north itself wanted. The north's acceptance of the south as a partner would give the south reason to
      reevaluate its own views.
    </p>
<p>
      In fact, few north-south disagreements have disappeared since 1974. Little substantive, intergovernmental debate
      on north-south matters has occurred. Yet the south's ideology has changed, if only a little, in response to
      northern concerns.
    </p>
<p>
      Was ul Haq wrong, then, when he said that a turning point was about to occur in 1975? Would it be wrong to apply
      Apter's theory and say that a fifth and final period in the development of the south's ideology began in
      1975 because the north crossed ul Haq's philosophical bridge and started to consider the third world
      necessary partners in world development?
    </p>
<p>
      Not completely. A new degree of mutual understanding between north and south appeared in 1975, and it continues,
      even if agreement remains far away. The south's views became the agenda for all multilateral discussion of
      north-south relations, and substantive north-south debate began to occur, even if rarely in intergovernmental
      forums.
    </p>
<p>
      Few governments thought such debate was important. After 1974 northern European states simply adopted much of the
      NIEO ideology as their own; little remained for them to convince the south of, or for the south to convince them
      of. The Warsaw Pact states and France defined themselves as in agreement with the south and had little interest
      in substantive debate that would show how different the third world's position and theirs really were. The
      United States and the important northern states that tend to follow the U.S. lead -- West Germany, Britain, and
      Japan -- stepped in and out of the north-south dialogue. Sometimes they supported rapid resolution of outstanding
      north-south conflicts. Sometimes they did not. At no time did they support substantive political debate on
      north-south issues. American policy makers held that on fundamentals northern and southern views were
      incompatible. The most powerful northern states only wanted to exchange concessions with the south; they did not
      want to debate until both north and south had a single view of their common interests.(<a href="#fn0276" id="bck_fn0276">3</a>) Futhermore, the south never pushed for substantive debate, although the Group
      of 77's political analysis shifted more and more in that direction.
    </p>
<p>
      Nonetheless, some substantive north-south debate has taken place since 1974, and, as a result, the LDCs have
      changed some of their views. Yet northern governments <a id="page_127"></a>have rarely been direct sources of
      those changes. Instead, nongovernmental leaders have. Northern European officials were not the only ones to cross
      ul Haq<sup>'</sup>s philosophical bridge. After 1974 many northern opinion leaders outside
      government, people like Willy Brandt, began to push for resolution of the north-south conflict. In the process
      they adopted some new order views and began to debate others. In response, the south increased its consideration
      of what northerners wanted international economic regimes to accomplish. In addition, the south adopted much of
      its new political analysis, its analysis of how to make the NIEO a reality, directly from the nongovernmental
      organizations through which northern opinion leaders expressed their support of some southern goals.
    </p>
<p>
      To illustrate these changes, this chapter is divided into four parts. The first section is a narrative of the
      north-south intergovernmental dialogue from 1975 through 1982. The second part discusses those northern goals
      that the NIEO ideology began to include after 1974. The third section looks at the policy proposals that the
      south has dropped since 1974. The final section discusses the experiments in tactics the LDCs have employed and
      illustrates why the south may decide that substantive intergovernmental debate is needed.
    </p>
<h2 id="ht0030"><a href="#bck_ht0030">The North-South Dialogue Since
    1974</a></h2>
<p>
      Nineteen seventy-four was the year of NIEO demands. The Declaration and Programme of Action passed by the General
      Assembly's Sixth Special Session and the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States, adopted by the
      General Assembly in its regular fall session, contained nothing more or less than the south<sup>'</sup>s position. Adoption of those resolutions involved little attempt to debate, or even to
      consider, alternative views.
    </p>
<p>
      Within two months after the adoption of the charter the most high-profile parts of the north-south dialogue had
      drastically changed. In February at Lome, the capital of Togo, the European Community and a group of third world
      nations from all southern regions except Latin America agreed upon a long-negotiated treaty. It provided European
      development financing and financing for third world trade income shortfalls while taking into account European
      needs for assured access to third world raw materials and markets. (<a href="#fn0277" id="bck_fn0277">4</a>) A few months later twenty-two nations began to meet in what was called the
      "Conference on International Economic Cooperation" (CIEC) in Paris. The conference's agenda
      included oil and the related resource issues that the north had thought would be on the agenda of the Sixth
      Special Session. The north insisted that participation in the CIEC be limited in order to assure it did not
      become a repeat of the 1974 <a id="page_128"></a>General Assembly sessions. At the same time the British
      Commonwealth met and approved a detailed, constructive analysis of the north-south problems that really
      represented a consensus of both its wealthy and poor members. Nineteen seventy-five also saw a cooperative
      meeting of UNID0(<a href="#fn0278" id="bck_fn0278">5</a>) and another United Nations special
      session called for the month before the beginning of the U.N.'s regular fall meetings.
    </p>
<p>
      The first four speeches to the General Assembly's Seventh Special Session exemplify the whole session and the
      rest of the north-south dialogue since then. Delegates were more cooperative than in 1974, but suggested little
      prospect for substantive north-south agreement. Despite many professions of sympathy by north to south and south
      to north, a great deal of misunderstanding remained.
    </p>
<p>
      Brazil spoke first. On most topics, the Brazilian delegate said, he was offering the Group of 77's opinion.
      He held two, somewhat contradictory, views of the prospects for the north-south dialogue: Because most northern
      states still had no national interest in the development of the south, realism suggested that the prospects for
      the north-south dialogue were dim. Yet, a bargain could be struck between north and south in which the north
      would gain a right to secure supplies of southern raw materials — that is, no more OPEC surprises — in exchange
      for accepting southern principles.(<a href="#fn0279" id="bck_fn0279">6</a>) The proposed
      bargain actually contradicted those principles since they included the sovereign right of states to control their
      own natural resources. Perhaps Brazil was proposing to give up that fundamental right in order to get northern
      agreement on other southern principles. Or perhaps it expected the north to agree to some statement of third
      world principles before the LDCs agreed to some treaty giving the north assured access; at that point the south
      could turn right around and say that agreeing to such a treaty would violate the principles the north had just
      affirmed. The Brazilian speech suggested that any hope the south had for a north-south settlement was misguided.
    </p>
<p>
      Daniel Patrick Moynihan followed the Brazilian, reading a message prepared for U.S. Secretary of State Henry
      Kissinger, who had decided to continue his shuttle diplomacy in the Middle East rather than attend the
      conference. Nonetheless, the fact that Kissinger had even momentarily thought about attending the meeting
      represented a major shift in U.S. policy, a shift apparent throughout the speech Moynihan read. The speech
      announced the reversal of the general U.S. opposition to commodity agreements and proposed a number of major new
      U.S. aid initiatives.(<a href="#fn0280" id="bck_fn0280">7</a>) These involved improving third
      world agriculture, something no third world state opposed, yet something that was hardly an NIEO priority given
      the long-standing southern focus on <a id="page_129"></a>industrialization. Nonetheless, even though the
      Kissinger speech concentrated on things that were somewhat beside the main point of the NIEO program, the speech
      did represent a major shift in U.S. policy toward the third world position. Southern states recognized that shift
      throughout the conference and since.
    </p>
<p>
      Italy, representing the European Community, spoke after the United States. Self-satisfied, the Italian delgate
      praised the Lome agreements and suggested that the European Community had long been in the forefront of developed
      country efforts on behalf of the third world.(<a href="#fn0281" id="bck_fn0281">8</a>) Later
      in the conference European Community members received some confirmation of their view of themselves. Tunisia
      singled out France as the only major DMC that really pushed for third world industrialization,(<a href="#fn0282" id="bck_fn0282">9</a>) and Yugoslavia praised the British government's cooperative policy
      toward the NIEO.(<a href="#fn0283" id="bck_fn0283">10</a>)
    </p>
<p>
      Finally Norway, not a European Community member but one of the northern European countries that have always been
      sympathetic to the south, took the podium. The Norwegian spoke more briefly than the others, but much more
      directly about what developed countries had to do if they supported the NIEO. Norway recognized that such an
      order would mean industrialization and diversification of third world economies, which, in turn, would mean the
      end of some industries in the north. In order that no one in Norway would have to suffer from the
      government's policy of encouraging the NIEO, the Norwegian government had adopted adjustment assistance
      policies, becoming one of the earliest of the few governments that compensate workers whose industrial jobs are
      lost to competition from poorer nations abroad.(<a href="#fn0284" id="bck_fn0284">11</a>)
    </p>
<p>
      In ul Haq<sup>'</sup>s terms, the Norwegian statement demonstrated that Norway had crossed the
      philosophical bridge. The Norwegian government recognized that for its own economy to advance the economies of
      third world nations had to advance as well, and it even based its domestic economic policy on that assumption.
      Most Norwegians shared their government's view of how their development and that of third world are linked.
      For them economic development was more than growth. By 1975, Norwegians, and other northern Europeans, unlike
      most people from DMCs, tended to agree when pollsters ask if the wealth of people in developed countries is
      somehow diminished by the poverty of people in other parts of the world.(<a href="#fn0285" id="bck_fn0285">12</a>)
    </p>
<p>
      It could be argued that the European Community's Lome policy represented a similar crossing of the
      philosophical bridge. At the very least, European Community members wanted to secure markets and sources of raw
      materials in the third world and would encourage third world development in order to do so.
    </p>
<p>
      It could not be argued that the same concerns motivated the American change of heart evident at the <a id="page_130"></a>Seventh Special Session. That in no way implies that Kissinger's speech was not significant or
      sincere. But as Catherine Gwin argues, the main reason the U.S. changed its policy toward the NIEO was because
      its previous policy of trying to divide the south, pitting the poorest nations against the oil states, simply had
      not worked. (<a href="#fn0286" id="bck_fn0286">13</a>) The policy failed both because the
      third world took a united stand and because the U.S. never really decided whether it wanted to ally with the
      poorer states against OPEC or with OPEC against the NIEO demands. Kissinger recognized that a more cooperative
      strategy for achieving U.S. interests was essential. U.S. interests involved secure supplies of oil for itself
      and its wealthy allies, but they did not include third world development. If anything, the United States was
      interested in limiting its material commitment to southern development in 1975. Recession following a period of
      high inflation made the U.S. government cautious about new financial commitments. Rather than saying that third
      world development was essential for U.S. development, Kissinger's speech said that U.S. growth was essential
      for third world growth. The first thing he thought the developed countries should do to help the third world was
      to get their own economies in order.(<a href="#fn0287" id="bck_fn0287">14</a>)
    </p>
<p>
      Since 1975, inflation and recession, along with the threat of inflation and recession, have dominated the
      developed economies unlike in any decade since the twenties and the thirties. Consequently, the Americans have
      constantly reiterated their view that the best thing northern governments could do for the third world is to
      establish stable continuous growth in their own, northern economies. Third world spokesmen have always said that
      this argument misses the point of the third world's NIEO demands.(<a href="#fn0288" id="bck_fn0288">15</a>) Most recently the UNCTAD Secretariat's preparatory document for the 1983 UNCTAD
      VI meeting argued that recovery of the world economy required deliberate policies to encourage recovery in the
      developing nations.(<a href="#fn0289" id="bck_fn0289">16</a>) Nonetheless, many northern
      governments and even many U.N. officials affirm what has been the U.S. position since 1975, that southern
      economies depend on northern economies but not vice versa.
    </p>
<p>
      Only one year after the Seventh Special Session the U.N. Secretariat reported to the General Assembly that the
      greatest hope for third world development that could be found in the events of 1976 was the recovery in developed
      nations. Nonetheless, the Secretariat made a point of saying that its interest in northern recovery should not be
      misconstrued as affirming the "drop-by-drop" theory of development. The north should do more to aid the
      third world than the little bit it could do after solving all northern economic problems.(<a href="#fn0290" id="bck_fn0290">17</a>)
    </p>
<p>
      The Secretariat's views should be read as saying <a id="page_131"></a>that very little happened in 1976 to
      make third world governments hopeful. Despite the change in northern tone, the Seventh Special Session resulted
      in no substantive agreements. 1976's fourth session of UNCTAD resulted in nothing but agreement that some
      issues surrounding a proposed integrated program of commodity pricing agreements, to be funded by a common fund
      for buffer stocks, should be discussed later. Some northern governments wanted them discussed only at the CIEC,
      which continued to languish in Paris without agreement. The best that the Group of 77 could say about the UNCTAD
      IV meeting was that in response to its substantive failure members of the group had agreed to coordinate their
      own efforts even more.(<a href="#fn0291" id="bck_fn0291">18</a>) For example, from 1977 onward
      the foreign ministries of each country in the group approved a united statement on current economic matters
      before each autumn's U.N. session.(<a href="#fn0292" id="bck_fn0292">19</a>)
    </p>
<p>
      The few portents of possible north-south agreement came from the actions of intergovernmental and nongovernmental
      organizations, not from government to government talks. At the fall U.N. session Jamaica's Don Mills spoke
      for many Group of 77 members when he praised a new attitude apparent in the World Bank.(<a href="#fn0293" id="bck_fn0293">20</a>) While the bank had not responded to the General Assembly's 1974 demand
      that all specialized agencies develop action plans for the NIEO, it had significantly changed its policies since
      the beginning of the decade. Bank President Robert McNamara replaced his earlier insistence upon population
      control as a panacea for development with a more sophisticated understanding of the local and global structural
      constraints. The bank began to emphasize education and health programs designed to break local cycles of poverty.
      In addition the bank substantially increased low-interest aid through the IDA. The World Bank also began to
      support a policy initially championed in the U.N.'s specialized agencies by the International Labor
      Organization, using development policy to eliminate poverty around the world by focusing aid on "basic
      needs."
    </p>
<p>
      The Group of 77's position on "basic needs" began and remained somewhat ambivalent. Too great a
      concentration of international effort on supporting basic needs would take emphasis away from the group's
      fundamental development goal, industrialization. In that way, basic needs programs supported by the north looked
      a lot like other northern efforts aimed at deflecting the north-south dialogue from what the LDCs felt was its
      proper course -- northern concerns with population control, resource limits to growth, agricultural development,
      and northern economic recovery. An Indian U.N. delegate in 1978, for example, affirmed the importance of
      fufilling basic needs but argued that concerns for social justice should not divert attention from the need to
      change the global economic system.(<a href="#fn0294" id="bck_fn0294">21</a>)
    </p>
<p>
<a id="page_132"></a>On the other hand, "basic needs" development began as something of a third world
      idea. The International Labor Organization and the World Bank picked it up from a group of Latin American
      scholars who used it to criticize the philosophy underlying the original limits to growth studies of the early
      seventies. Rather than deriving policy conclusions based on assumptions about what would happen if present trends
      were allowed to continue without policy changes, the way the northern limits to growth scholars had, the Latin
      American group argued that goals for global development should be set first and any efforts at modeling the world
      system should discover how best to achieve those goals. The Latin American group simply chose eliminating poverty
      worldwide as one of the goals that the world system should strive to achieve.(<a href="#fn0295" id="bck_fn0295">22</a>)
    </p>
<p>
      Somewhat ironically, in 1976 the south began to take the advice of a much more direct successor of the original
      northern limits to growth study. The original limits to growth study had been financed by the Club of Rome, a
      primarily western European and North American group of business people, government officials, and academics
      interested in global problems. In response to the criticism generated by the first report the club commissioned
      more studies. The third, <span>Reshaping International Order</span>, appeared in 1976 and
      argued for most of the third world's NIEO proposals as well as for proposals to deal with environmental
      limits to growth and global security problems.(23 ) Partially in response to this Club of Rome report's
      recommendations, Peru proposed adding to the NIEO program the demand that nations move toward disarmament and
      that the money saved by reduced military budgets be directed to development.(<a href="#fn0296" id="bck_fn0296">24</a>)
    </p>
<p>
      The report had further effects on the LDCs' position. The report outlined both a long term plan for achieving
      the new order as well as plans for immediate change. The long term plan specified the time needed to enact the
      major changes it envisioned much more carefully than the 1974 NIEO plans had, making it clear that a completely
      transformed international order was not really feasible for a generation, even with constant effort. At the
      beginning of the 1976 General Assembly debate on economic matters the Secretariat reiterated the same time frame,
      arguing that subsequent debate should consider the NIEO as something to be achieved between then and the end of
      the century.(<a href="#fn0297" id="bck_fn0297">25</a>)
    </p>
<p>
      Ideas found in the Club of Rome report had an even more significant effect on the south's views the next
      year. Again it was the Peruvians who brought the views into the intergovernmental debate. Nineteen sevety-seven
      was a year of great disappointment for the south. CIEC ended without substantive agreement on the third world
      program. Contradicting the north's explanation of the failure of the 1974 General Assembly meetings as the
      result of having too many nations involved, the south <a id="page_133"></a>explained the failure of CIEC as a
      result of having so few states represented. Mexico led off the fall General Assembly debate by saying that the
      assembly's major concern in 1977 should be to prevent such unrepresentative meetings from taking place
      again.(<a href="#fn0298" id="bck_fn0298">26</a>) Peru followed up with a much more detailed
      discussion of the CIEC, ending with the proposal that even if specific NIEO negotiations were to be conducted by
      small groups of states, all those negotiations should be carried out within a framework previously negotiated by
      all nations.(<a href="#fn0299" id="bck_fn0299">27</a>) This proposed structure of negotiations
      was almost identical to the one proposed by the Club of Rome.
    </p>
<p>
      Other LDCs immediately adopted the Peruvian position. Brazil had the Peruvian speech reprinted and distributed
      widely during the General Assembly meeting.(<a href="#fn0300" id="bck_fn0300">28</a>) The
      Group of 77 has maintained the Peruvian view of how north-south negotiations should be conducted ever since.
    </p>
<p>
      The original Peruvian speech noted that the one really positive thing that came out of the CIEC discussion was
      something that should come out of any substantive political debate, a real exchange of ideas. The Peruvian
      delegate felt that northern governments, especially the then new Carter administration in the U.S., had learned
      something about the south's views and had been convinced by some of them.(<a href="#fn0301" id="bck_fn0301">29</a>) Unfortunately, he still noted a great deal of the northern attitude that, according
      to Gwin, had motivated the original American change of heart toward the NIEO in 1975. Some northern states still
      considered the purpose of north-south negotiations to be "palliative or philanthropic."(<a href="#fn0302" id="bck_fn0302">30</a>)
    </p>
<p>
      The same debate illustrated much continuity in the American attitude. As evidence of the seriousness with which
      Carter took the U.N. debate, as U.S. representative he had sent Richard Cooper, a highly respected economist,
      probably the most qualified representative the U.S. had ever sent to U.N. economic meetings. Cooper reiterated
      the American view that the most important thing the U.S. could do for southern development was to keep its own
      economic house in order. When he commented on additional policies, he only emphasized things like basic needs
      that the south felt were somewhat beside the main point. He did not invite the south to be involved in
      transforming international economic regimes.(<a href="#fn0303" id="bck_fn0303">31</a>)
    </p>
<p>
      Cooper's attitude represented something of the "Trilateral" position that characterized the early
      Carter administration. European, North American, and Japanese government officials, corporate leaders, and policy
      makers created the Trilateral Commission as a response to the economic problems of the early seventies.
      Trilateral members emphasized reestablishing the postwar free trade system on a stronger footing.(<a href="#fn0304" id="bck_fn0304">32</a>) Trilateral reports proposed that the consensus needed to
      rebuild global economic regimes should be built in two parts, with the <a id="page_134"></a>"Trilateral
      countries," the United States, Japan, and the European Community (or at least its leading member, West
      Germany) agreeing among themselves and then dictating to, or "inviting the consensus of," the rest of
      the world. A 1977 report even proposed this as the way to gain global consensus on means to solve third world
      development problems.(<a href="#fn0305" id="bck_fn0305">33</a>) President Carter built his
      administration around fellow Trilateral members. Consequently, despite the increasing sympathy with the south
      that Peru had noted, the U.S. remained opposed to the Group of 77's strategy for negotiating a new order.
    </p>
<p>
      The north-south dialogue changed little throughout the rest of the Carter years. The General Assembly responded
      to the Peruvian proposal to have framework negotiations involving all states by having "committee of the
      whole" meetings on economic matters at each fall session. In 1979 Jamaica's Don Mills pointed out that
      such meetings had accomplished nothing.(<a href="#fn0306" id="bck_fn0306">34</a>) No one
      disagreed. The UNCTAD V meeting in 1979 resulted in little further progress on the integrated commodity program.
      (<a href="#fn0307" id="bck_fn0307">35</a>) A United Nations Conference on Science and
      Technology for Development met in September 1979, but achieved no substantive agreement on technology transfer.
      An uneventful meeting of UNIDO took place in 1980. Finally, the General Assembly met in another special session
      on the NIEO in 1980. The meeting did nothing more than prior meetings of the committee of the whole. The U.N.
      came up with a plan for the 1980s as a development decade, but that plan contained no framework treaty for NIEO
      negotiations.
    </p>
<p>
      The only thing that made the south hopeful at the 1980 special session was a speech by United States Secretary of
      State Muskie. Muskie referred to his government's recently completed <span>Global 2000
      Report</span>, which outlined reasons why U.S. development would become increasingly dependent on growth in other
      parts of the world. The report noted the disarray of the postwar economic system and the need for reform.(<a href="#fn0308" id="bck_fn0308">36</a>) Muskie's speech affirmed an American move away from
      Trilateralism that had been developing for some time. In May 1979 American security advisor Brzezinski had spoken
      of ". . . widening our primary relationships to encompass countries in Latin America, Africa, and
      Asia," and of developing a new "genuinely global" American foreign policy.(<a href="#fn0309" id="bck_fn0309">37</a>) Muskie's speech a year later implied that the U.S. had crossed the
      philosophical bridge and recognized the south as partners in development who would have to be part of the initial
      consensus on any restructured international economic order.
    </p>
<p>
      Nevertheless, the U.S. remained opposed to the ways in which the south proposed negotiating the NIEO, even when
      those proposed means had significant northern support. The Carter administration attitude toward a north-south
      summit on development exemplified that <a id="page_135"></a>attitude.
    </p>
<p>
      The idea for such a summit came out of the first report of the Brandt Commission, (<a href="#fn0310" id="bck_fn0310">38</a>) another nongovernmental group created in the seventies. This independent
      commission on development topics organized had been organized by Willy Brandt, former German prime minister and
      head of the world social democratic movement. The commission's aim was to produce a sort of ten year update
      of the Pearson Commission report. Brandt, therefore, chose his commissioners from policy makers and business
      people around the world, especially those from the north. Overall, the Brandt commissioners began with more
      conservative leanings than the members of the Pearson Commission. The Brandt Commission included Edward Heath,
      former head of the British Conservative Party, and Peter Peterson, Nixon's Commerce Secretary, both more
      conservative figures than the British and American politicians chosen by Pearson. Nonetheless, in comparison to
      the Pearson Commission's conclusions, the Brandt Commission's were more radical and more compatible with
      the NIEO ideology.
    </p>
<p>
      The Brandt Commission proposed to spark languishing north-south negotiations by a summit meeting of a limited
      number of heads of government from both developed and developing countries who would discuss and debate
      north-south matters. (<a href="#fn0311" id="bck_fn0311">39</a>) The press throughout the north
      quickly backed the 1980 Brandt summit proposal. But the U.S. government, involved in a presidential election and
      a foreign affairs crisis in Iran, did not.
    </p>
<p>
      Immediately after the 1980 U.S. presidential election, Mexico's president, Lopez Portillo, who along with
      Austrian socialist leader, Prime Minister Bruno Kreisky, had agreed to host the Brandt summit, visited with the
      new American president-elect. To the surprise of many in the south who knew Reagan as the man who rejected the
      <span>Global_2000 Report</span> out of hand and had never expressed the slightest belief that
      the LDCs were essential to the development of the north, Portillo convinced the new U.S. president to attend the
      summit held at Cancun, a Mexican resort.
    </p>
<p>
      As the Mexican Foreign Ministry's report of the Cancun summit makes clear, the vast majority of those
      represented — third world nations along with Austria, Canada, and Sweden — spent their time trying to convince
      the representatives of three nations — Reagan, British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, and West German Foreign
      Minister Hans Dietrich Genscher — to support an updated version of the Peruvian proposal of a way to negotiate a
      new order.(<a href="#fn0312" id="bck_fn0312">40</a>)
    </p>
<p>
      The new proposal called for a three phase series of "global negotiations." Negotiations would begin
      with establishing a framework within the General Assembly. Then bargaining over reforms of specific parts of the
      U.N. system would be conducted within the agency that <a id="page_136"></a>would be most affected — e.g.,
      development finance negotiations in the World Bank, trade negotiations under the auspices of the GATT and UNCTAD.
      Finally, the whole package of new order agreements would be discussed again by the General Assembly, which would
      iron out disagreements among proposed reforms and ratify the entire package.
    </p>
<p>
      Reagan's government found the proposal for global negotiations particularly problematic, and not just because
      it was to begin with the sort of huge General Assembly meeting that the U.S. had always considered pointless. The
      proposal had first been made by Algeria in 1979 after the failure of the General Assembly committee of the whole.
      Algeria made the proposal at the nonaligned summit in Havana, a meeting that had been particularly hostile to the
      U.S. (In fact, Reagan made it a condition of his acceptance of the Cancun invitation that titular nonaligned
      leader, Fidel Castro, not be included.) The nonaligned proposal for global negotiations had gone to the General
      Assembly. For over a year informal negotiations had continued in New York about how such negotiations should be
      conducted. But one of the first things the new Reagan U.N. representatives did was to withdraw from those
      discussions. They feared that global negotiations could go on for years and result in a treaty similar to the Law
      of the Sea Treaty being negotiated then. The Reagan government felt it could not support that treaty but feared
      not signing it after the U.S. had taken part in negotiations for so long.(<a href="#fn0313" id="bck_fn0313">41</a>)
    </p>
<p>
      Because of the Reagan administration's hesitancy, Cancun ended without substantive agreement on starting
      global negotiations. Nonetheless, the Mexican Foreign Ministry concluded that the Cancun summit was a success
      simply because it facilitated agreement on global negotiations. All states, including the U.S. and its two close
      allies, affirmed the need for those negotiations and accepted the General Assembly as their first venue and the
      specialized agencies as their second.(<a href="#fn0314" id="bck_fn0314">42</a>) The U.S.
      rejoined the informal meetings in New York aimed at resolving further differences.
    </p>
<p>
      Despite the Cancun agreement, at the end of 1982 the north-south dialogue had not advanced· Law of the Sea
      negotiations ended in April with the U.S. rejecting the pro-third world treaty and the U.S.'s major northern
      allies abstaining. Global negotiations remained stymied because of a disagreement that Britain, West Germany, and
      the U.S. had with the other members of the General Assembly. Those three states demanded that the assembly not be
      empowered to change any agreements reached in the specialized agencies. The third round of global negotiations
      would only be able to ratify those agreements when global negotiations return to the assembly in their final
      stage.(<a href="#fn0315" id="bck_fn0315">43</a>)
    </p>
<p>
      The stalemate over global negotiations assured that <a id="page_137"></a>the south's views did not change in
      1982. Third world speeches during the autumn General Assembly debate that year contained only one thing new: Even
      while reiterating calls for global negotiations to transform the global economic order, for the first time in
      eight years southern officials rarely used the phrase "New International Economic Order."
    </p>
<h2 id="ht0031"><a href="#bck_ht0031">The Debate and Nieo Goals</a></h2>
<p>
      No matter how southern rhetoric has changed, third world NIEO goals have changed no more after 1974 than they did
      in the thirty years before. After 1974 the south adopted new goals suggested by its northern supporters only when
      those goals could be made subordinant to the third world primary goal, industrialization. The south rejected
      attempts by its northern supporters to make "fulfilling basic needs" as important as industrialization,
      but in the process the LDCs added something similar as a secondary goal. The third world completely rejected an
      attempt by some of its northern nongovernmental supporters to oppose further industrialization. And the LDCs did
      nothing to expand their NIEO goals to include those that DMC governments think are central to any international
      economic system.
    </p>
<p>
      The goals the LDCs adopted from their northern European allies include those in the Peruvian proposal for global
      disarmament to finance development. This proposal had been made at the first UNCTAD in 1964 and then ignored by
      the south for more than ten years. Disarmament had long been a distant goal of some of the south's strongest
      northern supporters, including Sweden.(<a href="#fn0316" id="bck_fn0316">44</a>) As long as
      disarmament was tied to development, LDCs were happy to create a U.N. majority in favor of a special General
      Assembly session on the topic. (<a href="#fn0317" id="bck_fn0317">45</a>) An element of
      opportunism contributed to the south's adoption of this goal. The most consistent champions of Peru's
      disarmament for development proposal have not been LDC governments? they have been nongovernmental commissions
      like Willy Brandt's and the disarmament commission later formed by Brandt Commission member, Swedish Prime
      Minister Olof Palme. In fact, Brandt's report points out that since 1974 most third world nations have been
      accelerating arms purchases even more than most developed nations.(<a href="#fn0318" id="bck_fn0318">46</a>)
    </p>
<p>
      Another new third world goal adopted in a similar way began with a proposal made by Austrian Prime Minister
      Kreisky. Kreisky suggested a Marshall-like plan for infrastructure development in Africa in order to stimulate
      European economies·(<a href="#fn0319" id="bck_fn0319">47</a>) Third world officials extended
      his idea to a call for a new Marshall Plan for the entire third world, one that would stimulate economies
      throughout the north. (<a href="#fn0320" id="bck_fn0320">48</a>) This was one of the <a id="page_138"></a>rare cases when the LDCs expressed concern with northern growth.
    </p>
<p>
      The only other example concerns trade and protectionism among northern countries. Just as northern concern about
      the slow and uneven recoveries after each of the recessions since 1974 motivated Kreisky's proposal, the same
      concern made many northern governments worry about protectionism that might follow if the rapid cycles of
      recession and weak recovery continued. The south adopted this concern with maintaining the liberal trade system
      among developed states. But the general issue of northern protectionism became important to the south only when
      attached to the older NIEO issue of unfair tariffs on LDC goods.
    </p>
<p>
      In 1979 the Tokyo Round of GATT negotiations ended with agreements on significant tariff and nontariff barriers
      to trade among DMCs. Fears of mounting protectionism and continuing recession, which had been voiced by some
      northern scholars for almost a decade, eased. The <span>New York Times</span> even cautiously
      suggested that the postwar economic system had survived its greatest trial intact. (<a href="#fn0321" id="bck_fn0321">49</a>) Nonetheless, all the LDCs in GATT except Argentina boycotted the trade pact
      ceremonies protesting that duties on exports from LDCs had been reduced significantly less than those on DMC
      exports. Moreover, DMCs continued to protect national industries with which the LDCs could best compete.(<a href="#fn0322" id="bck_fn0322">50</a>) At the fifth UNCTAD meeting the following month the DMCs
      insisted that they had done what they could for the LDCs under GATT rules. They did not want to violate those
      rules because, as European Community delegate Sir Roy Denman put it, without the pact the west would have to
      return to ". . . the economic blizzards of the 1930s, the hunger, fear, and political extremism experienced
      then."(<a href="#fn0323" id="bck_fn0323">51</a>)
    </p>
<p>
      The DMCs refused to reopen tariff negotiations, and the LDCs then adopted northern rhetoric about the global
      results of protectionism in order to argue more convincingly for greater access to developed markets.(<a href="#fn0324" id="bck_fn0324">52</a>) Third world attacks on protectionism among northern states
      as well as on northern protection against LDC goods continue to appear, even if they appear somewhat
      uncomfortably alongside third world proposals for international approval of development-oriented national
      restrictions on trade.
    </p>
<p>
      The south reacted more consistently and vigorously to northern concerns with development for "basic
      needs," concerns that became so important after 1974. Those concerns commanded greater attention in the
      south because many northern democratic socialists and liberals who support the third world consider development
      for basic needs to be fundamental.(<a href="#fn0325" id="bck_fn0325">53</a>) Northern concern
      with basic needs can be traced back to sixties' critiques of aid, including the Pearson Commission report,
      which emphasized that the bulk of foreign aid given for humanitarian <a id="page_139"></a>purposes never improved
      the lives of the world's poor. It was used for the political and economic aggrandizement of particular third
      world elites, often the real goal of northern donors.(<a href="#fn0326" id="bck_fn0326">54</a>)
    </p>
<p>
      Despite the fact that early suggestions for basic needs development came from northerners sympathetic to the
      south and even from southern scholars, many LDC leaders saw such strategies as attacks on their ideas. Third
      world officials viewed basic needs strategies supported by the U.S. government under Carter and by the World Bank
      as northern attempts to change the focus of global debate by proposing that domestic equity be a condition for
      receiving further aid. If northern officials had been successful, so the argument goes, they would have escaped
      responsibilities to provide aid. That was the real aim of "basic needs" proposals. Don Mills outlines
      these objections and concludes:
    </p>
<p>
      There is a great need, therefore, for the concept of basic needs to be brought into a realistic relationship with
      the facts of political and economic organization and development so that its intrinsic value can be preserved
      without it becoming a philosophy of development, or the ultimate aim of the development process.(<a href="#fn0327" id="bck_fn0327">55</a>)
    </p>
<p>
      Even if the basic needs notion has been used by some northern governments as a simplistic justification for
      inaction, the idea underlying it has always been part of the position of most northerners who sympathize with the
      south and are interested in something more than castigating third world elites. Gunnar Myrdal's economic
      theories, for example, demand increasing economic equality throughout the world, well beyond assuring that each
      person's basic economic needs are met, as a goal of economic development and as a means for both providing
      incentives to save and assuring the ability to produce. Nonetheless, Myrdal argues that the structural
      constraints in many developing states make it impossible for them to institute programs encouraging domestic
      economic equality until greater national wealth has been created.(<a href="#fn0328" id="bck_fn0328">56</a>) Likewise, the intuitive notion of international economic justice expressed by La
      Guardia in the forties rested upon globally meeting basic human economic needs, but La Guardia felt it was wrong
      to blame governments for saying that other economic goals were more important. Each nation's primary economic
      development goals would probably be unique. Nonetheless, meeting basic economic needs was, for La Guardia, a
      global responsibility to achieve a goal that was the same everywhere. Meeting basic economic needs would allow
      nations to more easily pursue their unique economic development.
    </p>
<p>
      The social democratic perspective exemplified by <a id="page_140"></a>Myrdal's ideas and the type of
      liberalism La Guardia expressed can bridge the gap between the Group of 77 and those northerners who ignore
      southern demands. In fact, northern European states have become go-betweens in the north-south conflict in part
      because of their insistence that the NIEO be amended to meet basic economic needs.(<a href="#fn0329" id="bck_fn0329">57</a>) Likewise, private individuals who share such perspectives have been able to do
      the most to organize support for the NIEO in developed countries, in part because they have demonstrated their
      own support for meeting basic needs development. Michael Harrington, the head of the American democratic
      socialists, makes this explicit in his <span>The Vast Majority</span>, published in 1977. He
      argues the merits of the south's position and appeals to the charitable "best side" of the American
      people, their sympathy with the poor, the attitudes which motivated the development of basic needs strategies in
      the first place.(<a href="#fn0330" id="bck_fn0330">58</a>) The popularity in the north of even
      the Brandt Commission's report, which deliberately avoids appeals to charity, certainly comes in part from
      its concern with the plight of the world's poorest people rather than with the plight of the governments of
      the world's poorest nations.
    </p>
<p>
      The importance of basic needs notions to the south's strongest northern allies assured that the third world,
      itself, would adopt something akin to this goal. Beginning with the General Assembly's Declaration on Social
      Progress and Development in 1969, NIEO documents describe economic justice for individuals as a defining
      characteristic of development. After the Sixth Special Session in 1974, third world spokesmen began to link
      economic justice for individuals more directly to the central NIEO goal of industrialization. For example, the
      Latin American industrialization conferences
    </p>
<p>
      . . . stressed that domestic industrialization policies must take into account the need for an adequate
      distribution of income to make possible the expansion of domestic markets. In that way industrial growth can be
      conducive to the attainment of the objective of raising the standard of living and eliminating
      unemployment.(<a href="#fn0331" id="bck_fn0331">59</a>)
    </p>
<p>
      The more flowery language of the UNIDO conference in 1975 put the point this way:
    </p>
<p>
      All states should recognize that, in any industrial development process, social justice must be the irreplaceable
      means, in the spiritual, economic, and social aspects, to obtain the objective of a just society pervaded by a
      spirit of solidarity.(<a href="#fn0332" id="bck_fn0332">60</a>)
    </p>
<p>
      The point is to advocate justice for individuals as a secondary goal, a means to achieving the more significant
      <a id="page_141"></a>NIEO goals of industrialization and national unity.
    </p>
<p>
      This statement illustrates one way third world NIEO advocates propose to resolve their debate with their northern
      supporters over basic needs policies. Meeting basic needs will become a necessary, but secondary, new order goal.
    </p>
<p>
      Yet the debate remains open. The third world alliance could decide to treat domestic economic justice the same
      way it threats population control, as one possible, but not necessary, means to achieve more important
      development goals, a means that individual third world governments should be free to choose or not to choose.
      Meeting basic needs could hardly be a consistent part of the third world ideology as long as many LDCs do little
      to meet them, as long as some southern leaders can be forced by the facts to make statements like the one Raul
      Prebisch made at UNCTAD V in 1979 when he concluded that:
    </p>
<p>
      . . . callous elites in the developing countries were ruining the chances of the people to raise living standards
      through trade. They had turned their countries into "privileged consumption societies."(<a href="#fn0333" id="bck_fn0333">61</a>)
    </p>
<p>
      Prebisch proposed that national development programs be more strictly monitored by international agencies to
      assure that public welfare is improved, a view perfectly consistent with proposals like those of the Brandt
      Commission and the 1976 Club of Rome study. Southern governments have not adopted Prebisch's view on this
      subject as their own. While the debate over basic needs may have made meeting them an NIEO goal, the new order
      ideology still considers it up to national governments to decide whether or not the goal has been achieved.
    </p>
<p>
      The late-seventies nongovernmental debate on a reformed international economic order brought up one other goal
      that the south more firmly rejected. In the early seventies, under the influence of limits to growth ideas,
      praise of industrialization waned in the developed nations. This had an effect on the third world. Almost any LDC
      contains a small class of people who will find anti-industrialism appealing. V. S. Naipaul, a novelist who is far
      from sympathetic to the goals of third world governments, nonetheless shows how weak an anti-industrial
      philosophy will be in a nation like India where the landed elite might look for the integrity of a dimly
      remembered preindustrial past. Such concerns can easily be directed by government policy into programs for
      "appropriate" or "intermediate" technologies, alongside but not replacing more traditional
      means of industrialization.(<a href="#fn0334" id="bck_fn0334">62</a>) Nonetheless, in the
      seventies many northern sympathizers expressed hope that the south would have a future, if not without industry,
      at least free <a id="page_142"></a>from the horrors of industrialization that people in the north had had to
      suffer.
    </p>
<p>
      Despite this internal and external pressure southern governments never reversed their calls for
      industrialization. Rather, they responded to such ideas by emphasizing that industrialization had to be
      undertaken in ways appropriate to a nation's culture and to the physical environment. They reaffirmed their
      older concern with nurturing the cultural differences between nations and emphasized the new principle of
      preserving the environment which had come out of the north-south debate in the early seventies. But neither
      affirmation denied the goal of industrialization. By the end of the seventies, the anti-industrialism of northern
      NIEO sympathizers had waned as much as that of their southern allies. The debate led to agreement on the position
      embodied earlier in the Cocoyoc Declaration made by southern leaders and northern nongovernmental supporters.
      Both southern officials and their northern supporters affirmed that industrialization of the third world was
      essential and that the south should learn from the north's failure to protect the physical environment and
      cultural traditions when industrializing.(<a href="#fn0335" id="bck_fn0335">63</a>)
    </p>
<p>
      In summary, some people from the north did have an effect on the way southern leaders conceived of NIEO goals in
      the late seventies, and those changes in LDC views did result from substantive debate. Yet northern governments
      rarely debated and the changes in LDC goals that took place were minor. The south never focused on the goals that
      the most powerful northern governments addressed when they discussed reforming the international economic order.
      The south only changed its goals to accommodate some of the concerns expressed by northern supporters. But since
      the realm of disagreement between the south and its northern supporters, both in and outside of government, was
      so narrow, the substantive debate between those two groups could lead to little new. In the one case where
      northern supporters of the south insisted upon a goal substantially different than those supported by the Group
      of 77, the area of basic needs, the debate continues.
    </p>
<h2 id="ht0032"><a href="#bck_ht0032">The Debate and Nieo Policy
    Proposals</a></h2>
<p>
      The debate continues over specific NIEO policy proposals as well. Nonetheless, some north-south agreement on
      controlling yet encouraging transnational investment, facilitating the transfer of technology, eliminating the
      brain drain, and redeploying northern industrial capacity to the third world has occurred since 1974. Agreement
      took place after substantial clarification but no substantive change in new order policy proposals. By the end of
      the seventies <a id="page_143"></a>international codes of conduct for TNCs and for the transfer of technology
      appeared imminent. The difference between the DMC view of the primacy of property rights and the LDC view of the
      primacy of national rights had been clarified. And a few northern nations had started to redeploy industry to the
      third world.(<a href="#fn0336" id="bck_fn0336">64</a>)
    </p>
<p>
      A small UNCTAD commission concerned with the transfer of technology clarified the south's views on property.
      The first draft code on the transfer of technology proposed by Brazil in 1975 identified technology as part of
      the universal human heritage, thus claiming an LDC right to technology higher than the rights of property owners
      yet not associated with the rights of states per se. (<a href="#fn0337" id="bck_fn0337">65</a>) Further clarification of this principle found in later UNCTAD versions of the
      proposed code illustrate a new order position that does not simply place national rights over property above
      owner's rights, but rather is concerned with having international law -- binding codes of conduct on
      technology and TNCs, not traditional international law — define the extent of proprietary rights under the
      assumption that some property, the resources of the ocean as well as human knowledge, is a common heritage of
      humankind. Other property belongs to individuals or groups, under the laws of some sovereign nation. To take into
      account the "primacy" of the national rights of people in developing countries, NIEO advocates want
      those countries to be given the fullest possible access to technologies whose transfer is not subject to private
      decision.(<a href="#fn0338" id="bck_fn0338">66</a>) To put it in simpler language, national
      governments must give technical knowledge they own to other national governments under the notion of common
      heritage. Nonetheless, the proprietary rights of private owners of technology should continue to be protected for
      a fixed period of time by national governments and by international patents. The south wants the principle issue
      of technology transfer to be one of the duties of states to aid each other, not one of property rights.
    </p>
<p>
      Larger UNCTAD meetings also encouraged changes in the south's ideology. At UNCTAD IV in 1976 the LDCs renamed
      the brain drain the "reverse transfer of technology" to emphasize the similarity between the gain of
      technically skilled third world people by developed nations and the gain of technical know-how by third world
      states.(<a href="#fn0339" id="bck_fn0339">67</a>) Specific policies for combating the brain
      drain and for redeploying developed industries were left to national governments. Thus, little substance has been
      added to the new order policy analysis of these issues.
    </p>
<p>
      The same is true of the NIEO analysis of techniques for facilitating the transfer of technology and encouraging
      yet controlling TNCs. The proposed codes of conduct for each continue to emphasize strengthening the bargaining
      power of LDCs. This would be accomplished by exchanging information more freely and by forbidding <a id="page_144"></a>investment policies which discriminate against certain groups of states.(<a href="#fn0340" id="bck_fn0340">68</a>) These points do not bother most northern states, although the idea of binding
      international codes to assure compliance remains an issue for north-south debate.
    </p>
<p>
      The actual north-south debate since 1974 has had a more marked effect on the LDCs' analysis of policies that
      are meant to encourage industrialization less directly. In response to the debate, the south actually dropped
      some of its demands.
    </p>
<p>
      Of course, most of the NIEO policies for restructuring the financial and monetary systems proposed at the Sixth
      Special Session continue to be supported by the Group of 77. Many have also received northern support. Since
      1974, north and south have agreed on new aid targets. Nations with special development problems — the least
      developed, landlocked, and island states received greater attention, especially at UNCTAD IV, which agreed to
      long term measures favoring these states in trade, finance, technical assistance, shipping, and insurance.(<a href="#fn0341" id="bck_fn0341">69</a>) At CIEC six individual donor nations and the European
      Community pledged one billion dollars to the LLDCs. (<a href="#fn0342" id="bck_fn0342">70</a>)
      The donor nations also supported large replenishments of funds to IDA and to the regional development banks as
      well as sales of IMF gold reserves and some expansion of SDR liquidity designed to aid poorer nations.(<a href="#fn0343" id="bck_fn0343">71</a>) Taken together, though, these changes in the aid and
      financial aspects of north-south relations represented only limited reforms.
    </p>
<p>
      Nonetheless, the Group of 77 amended its most radical proposals for restructuring these systems in response to
      DMC receptiveness to less radical proposals. In 1975 many third world countries were calling for generalized debt
      relief — conversion of outstanding aid loans into grants retroactively. The UNCTAD Secretariat provided the
      analysis justifying a common response to the different debt problems experienced by different LDCs:
    </p>
<p>
      The present debt servicing difficulties of the developing countries are not the result of specific external
      circumstances peculiar to particular countries . . . The problem clearly has a more general dimension since it
      springs from maladjustments in the world economy and is beyond the ability of the developing countries to
      control.(<a href="#fn0344" id="bck_fn0344">72</a>)
    </p>
<p>
      Prior to the late 1970s few of the developed countries and neither the World Bank nor the IMF expressed much
      sympathy for the long standing third world demands for general debt relief. In 1975 the prospects for generalized
      debt relief appeared bleak.
    </p>
<p>
      They became brighter when financial leaders of the developed nations started to support debt relief. <a id="page_145"></a>Although they did not accept the NIEO argument that debt burdens were systemic problems affecting
      third world states, major private bankers and leaders of national banks in some DMCs felt that prospect of
      default by many third world debtors would destabilize an already shaky world financial situation. As summarized
      by the UMCTAD Secretariat in June 1977,
    </p>
<p>
      . . . in recent months several authorities have begun to accept the need for some form of official initiative,
      there being "growing recognition" that private intermediaries may not be able to manage the
      task.(<a href="#fn0345" id="bck_fn0345">73</a>)
    </p>
<p>
      In August 1977 CIEC approved guidelines for debt relief negotiations on a case by case rather than general
      basis.(<a href="#fn0346" id="bck_fn0346">74</a>) With some widespread debt rescheduling a
      practical possibility after 1977, individual third world nations withdrew their support of general debt relief.
      Brazil, for example, highly dependent on private credit, realized that it could be jeopardized if the government
      waged an active campaign for generalized third world debt relief.(<a href="#fn0347" id="bck_fn0347">75</a>) By mid-1979 British economist and observer of the third world debate Paul Streeten
      could conclude that the Group of 77 had dropped proposals for generalized debt relief in light of prospects for
      case by case relief.(<a href="#fn0348" id="bck_fn0348">76</a>)
    </p>
<p>
      Streeten may have spoken too soon. The continuing global economic crisis of the early eighties increased the
      pressure for debt relief. In 1983 the Brandt Commission issued its second report, giving significant northern
      support to global solutions to the third world debt crisis. (<a href="#fn0349" id="bck_fn0349">77</a>) Later in 1983, at UNCTAD VI, the Group of 77 returned to its calls for generalized
      debt relief.(<a href="#fn0350" id="bck_fn0350">78</a>) Nonetheless, both exclusion and
      readmission of this proposal to the south's ideology responded, in part, to northern initiatives in the
      north-south debate.
    </p>
<p>
      In a very different way, northern actions triggered the third world's deemphasis of another element of the
      NIEO financial package, the Link between new SDR allocations and aid to third world states. The utility of the
      SDR-Link proposal rests on the assumption that the IMF will periodically and predictably create new SDRs so that
      there will be a predictable source of new foreign exchange for the governments of poorer nations. Between 1972
      and 1979 no new SDRs were created. A date for new allocation, January 1978, even passed without IMF action.
      Nations with convertible currencies had doubted the need for new allocations. The floating exchange rate system
      established in response to the U.S. new economic policy of 1971 provided a means for creating new liquidity
      without new SDR allocations. Because the amount of each of the currencies exchanges in world money markets could
      be increased by the national decisions of central banks, <a id="page_146"></a>the potential role of the SDR had
      been reduced. That meant, as the UNCTAD Secretariat concluded in 1975, the Link was much less feasible.(<a href="#fn0351" id="bck_fn0351">79</a>5
    </p>
<p>
      After 1974 the focus of third world concerns about monetary reform shifted to advocating a greater role for SDRs
      and to returning to the original Bretton Woods system of fixed exchange rates.(<a href="#fn0352" id="bck_fn0352">80</a>) By late 1978, when the Managing Director of the IMF was seeking a fifty percent
      increase in IMF quotas and a new allocation of SDRs, the LDC members of the fund had dropped their calls for the
      Link. Instead, they concentrated on convincing the fund to relax restrictions upon new LDC borrowing from
      expanded quotas. They wanted the fund to moderate its requirements affecting the internal and external pricing of
      LDC commodities and the value of LDC currencies.(<a href="#fn0353" id="bck_fn0353">81</a>) In
      a similar distraction from the previous third world focus on the Link proposal, in 1976 the nonaligned states
      considered new proposals for a third world reserve currency, proposals which have never gone beyond the
      discussion stage.(<a href="#fn0354" id="bck_fn0354">82</a>)
    </p>
<p>
      As they did with the financial policies they supported, NIEO advocates shifted the trade policies they emphasized
      in response to northern initiatives of the late seventies. The LDCs changed only the focus of their political
      action, not the substance of the proposals they supported. In 1976 with the passage of a comprehensive trade act
      in the United States, tariff preferences to the third world became almost universal.(<a href="#fn0355" id="bck_fn0355">83</a>) Temporarily, until the conclusion of the next round of GATT negotiations in
      1979, this ceased to be the major trade issue for the LDCs. It was replaced by the Integrated Programme for
      Commodities (IPC), the system of buffer stocks to be purchased from a common international fund and then used to
      support prices of certain commodities. Despite the fact that DMCs consistently made concessions toward the third
      world on the IPC, no substantive agreement on new commodity pacts has been reached.
    </p>
<p>
      A small group of UNCTAD permanent staff members created the IPC proposal· It reflected Keynes's suggestions
      for commodity price stabilization as well as the vaguer requirements for giving third world nations control over
      their external trade found in the 1974 NIEO documents. The invention of the IPC involved dropping one of the
      south<sup>'</sup>s most radical demands of 1974. Even the earliest versions of the IPC included
      no proposals for indexing the prices of third world commodities to the prices of DMC goods. Not only did most
      DMCs find indexing objectionable, the UNCTAD staff could think of no way to make it work in practice.(<a href="#fn0356" id="bck_fn0356">84</a>) Of course in 1974 the IPC looked only slightly more
      feasible than indexing. Almost every element of the IPC was anathema to those northern states that acted upon
      free trade ideologies.
    </p>
<p>
      DMC positions moderated. In 1975 the U.S. indicated its willingness to negotiate new commodity agreements. In
      <a id="page_147"></a>1977 the new Carter administration accepted the idea of the Common Fund.(<a href="#fn0357" id="bck_fn0357">85</a>) The Eastern European socialist states, the northern European states,
      Australia, New Zealand, and to a lesser extent Japan and other European Community members have supported the
      general notion of the IPC since 1975. While the developed nations supported the principles of the IPC at UNCTAD
      IV and V, disagreements continued over how the Common Fund should be administered, what commodities could be
      stabilized by the program, and whether or not some attempt should be made to increase commodity prices over the
      market trend. Robert Rothstein reports that the simple limitation of time available to the small group of UNCTAD
      staff members familiar with the IPC restricted the extent to which NIEO advocates could respond to the
      north's technical objections.(<a href="#fn0358" id="bck_fn0358">86</a>)
    </p>
<p>
      In addition, the LDCs tended to worry about their unity throughout the IPC negotiations, and therefore remained
      cautious about adopting new positions. They often failed to respond to northern initiatives.( <a href="#fn0359" id="bck_fn0359">87</a> ) Conceivably the reluctance of Group of 77 members to debate the
      technical problems of the IPC more vigorously reflected an unwillingness to give those LDCs most likely to
      benefit from the pact additional trade advantages so soon after many of the same states had received the benefits
      of the European Community's Lome Pact. That appeared to be what disturbed some states in the south, the
      wealthier nations of Latin America.(<a href="#fn0360" id="bck_fn0360">88</a>) In any event,
      the issue of DMC tariff preferences, especially salient to Latin America, again became the center of the
      north-south trade debate before the IPC could be created. Despite international agreement on the outlines of the
      Common Fund in 1979, no new commodity agreements or agreements on other elements of the IPC have been reached.
      The north-south debate produced a partial agreement in principle without an active program.
    </p>
<h2 id="ht0033"><a href="#bck_ht0033">The Debate and the Group of 77's
    Political Analysis</a></h2>
<p>
      Despite the lack of progress, and despite the increasingly radical scholarly analysis being produced by third
      world dependency theorists,(<a href="#fn0361" id="bck_fn0361">89</a>) no significant
      radicalization of the third world position took place between 1975 and 1983. The political analysis acted upon by
      LDCs in the late seventies involved no proposals for projecting third world power beyond the use of Group of 77
      unity in international organizations and the use of "commodity power" of individual developing states
      through stricter controls over foreign firms. Even if at the end of the decade the Saudi oil minister could still
      tell reporters that OPEC would refuse to stabilize energy prices until the DMCs began to be serious about the
      NIEO,(<a href="#fn0362" id="bck_fn0362">90</a>) OPEC states never pressured developed states
      to <a id="page_148"></a>accept the NIEO by cutting off oil.
    </p>
<p>
      Obviously, most LDCs consulted more than the NIEO ideology when they made foreign economic policy. OPEC states
      could not be convinced to sacrifice their interests as oil producers to the cause of the NIEO. Not only would
      revenues be cut by attempts to use the oil weapon — a major disadvantage to a few OPEC members like Nigeria --
      such action would also invite military retaliation against the oil producers.
    </p>
<p>
      In addition, in the late 1970s the positions of the DMCs encouraged continued moderation of third world political
      analysis. Even the most status quo oriented developed states had become more receptive to specific NIEO policies
      and to the general idea of a new order. They had not been convinced by the oil price increases. The more
      conservative DMCs only changed their opinions after months of the discussion that the oil price increases had
      begun.
    </p>
<p>
      Instead of advocating new means to extend third world power, NIEO sponsors concentrated upon proposing and
      advocating changes in the institutional structure of the U.N. system, redesigning the system to achieve new order
      goals. A comprehensive plan for restructuring the economic agencies, written for the Seventh Special Session in
      1975, became the basis for subsequent NIEO proposals. The report proposed that UNIDO be made a specialized agency
      with status equivalent to the World Bank and the IMF.(<a href="#fn0363" id="bck_fn0363">91</a>) Otherwise, the overall structure of global economic institutions envisioned by NIEO
      advocates otherwise remained as postwar framers of the Bretton Woods system had suggested, including the creation
      of an ITO out of UNCTAD and GATT. The only Other NIEO institutional innovation would be to make the IMF a true
      global central bank.(<a href="#fn0364" id="bck_fn0364">92</a>)
    </p>
<p>
      The report on restructuring recommended that existing U.N. agencies adopt conciliation procedures when the NIEO
      is being negotiated.(<a href="#fn0365" id="bck_fn0365">93</a> ) Such procedures, if
      universally adopted in the U.N. and its specialized agencies, would give the third world a new veto in some
      agencies including the World Bank, IMF, and Economic and Social Council, without going to the extreme of
      sanctioning majority rule of states. Nonetheless, neither the advantages of this compromise on rule making, nor
      its disadvantages in terms of possible delays in making needed decisions, have been widely debated.
    </p>
<p>
      Before agreeing on the rules for institutions where the NIEO is to be negotiated, north and south need to agree
      that there will be an NIEO and that it will be created through negotiation. The northern crossing of ul Haq's
      philosophical bridge represents agreement on the first point, even though it remains to be seen whether or not
      the U.S. and its most powerful northern allies are deeply committed to a reformed international economic order.
      Yet, by itself, the north cannot assure that the <a id="page_149"></a>NIEO will be created through negotiation.
      The south has to agree.
    </p>
<p>
      Since 1974 the south has added an understanding of the need for negotiations to its ideology. The Group of
      77's earliest political analysis, the views predominant in the group from 1964 through the first years of the
      seventies, found its justification in Utopian principles of international law, "the sovereign equality of
      states," and in pluralist theories of DMC government. The group later adopted a political analysis taken
      from realist theories of international relations, emphasizing the projection of power in an essentially
      heartless, anarchic world, the analysis that led to theories of collective self-reliance and collective economic
      security as well as to justifications of the OPEC price increases. After 1974 the south adopted a new political
      analysis, emphasizing what could be done through international negotiation. If pluralist theories of DMC
      governments and realist theories of international relations can be said to have motivated the first two Group of
      77 political analyses, the whole range of theories about negotiation can be said to motivate the group's
      latest views.
    </p>
<p>
      The ideas about rule making taken from the report on U.N. reforms represent a later addition to this analysis.
      The south's preference for negotiation, rather than direct actions like the OPEC price increases, began in
      response to the conciliatory northern positions at the Seventh Special Session. The fact that OPEC's success
      could not be replicated by other commodity producing countries reinforced the third world preference for
      negotiation.
    </p>
<p>
      The LDCs' experience with CIEC made them challenge some of the north's conventional wisdom about what
      makes for successful negotiations. After the Sixth Special Session, the developed countries, especially the
      United States, had argued in favor of more intimate negotiating sessions on a limited number of topics. From the
      south's point of view CIEC, which followed this model, was a near disaster. After CIEC the south emphasized
      that universal agreement in principle to the NIEO was needed before smaller meetings on specifics could be
      fruitful. Thus the south adopted something similar to the Club of Rome's suggestion that a framework treaty
      be worked out by all U.N. members.
    </p>
<p>
      The obvious failure of this policy led to reevaluation of what had been wrong with the northern preference for
      meetings of a few countries on a few topics in the first place. The LDCs reiterated that such meetings could not
      fully represent the diversity of opinion in the third world. But, at this early stage of negotiation at least,
      another failure of CIEC proved more telling. Not only had CIEC failed to consider the views of all countries or
      to integrate all topics, the negotiations began without agreement on a need for an <a id="page_150"></a>NIEO.
    </p>
<p>
      That, in fact, had been a deliberate decision by the most powerful developed states. Their governments felt that
      agreement in principle between north and south would prove impossible. The best that could be hoped for was
      agreements on specific small reforms arrived at through the exchange of concessions between north and
      south.(<a href="#fn0366" id="bck_fn0366">94</a>) The most powerful northern states thus acted
      against William Zartman's dictum that a formula for international agreement has to be arrived at before the
      details of any successful agreement can be worked out.(<a href="#fn0367" id="bck_fn0367">95</a>)
    </p>
<p>
      The south recognized the usefulness of this dictum only after the failures of the committee of the whole and
      after the Brandt Commission made alternative suggestions. Cancun's limited size allowed ideas to be shared
      but unlike CIEC, Cancun aimed at agreement on a general formula for later north-south negotiations. Nonetheless,
      the choice of participants at Cancun precluded wide-ranging debate on possible formulas for an NIEO. Most of the
      participants stood with the south. Cancun could only have had one of two outcomes. The U.S., Germany, and the
      U.K. could agree to the formulas proposed by the south, or else no agreement would occur at all. In fact both
      occurred.
    </p>
<p>
      The overall direction of change in the south's political analysis since 1974 should be clear. The Group of 77
      has moved ever closer to a relatively sophisticated analysis of what is needed in order for there to be a
      successfully negotiated NIEO. The Cancun summit suggests that the south has yet to reach the conclusion that
      substantive debate on a formula for an NIEO is needed. In such debate the south would have to remain as open to
      being convinced as it demands that its opponents be. Nonetheless, the Group of 77's thinking has moved in
      that direction, as evidenced since 1974 by the increasing moderation of some southern economic demands and by the
      specific moves of north-south negotiations to forums where substantive debate is likely, as well as by the
      south's support of an increasing role for U.N. conciliation procedures that allow for substantive debate.
    </p>
<p>
      Ready explanations for the direction of southern thinking can be found. The theories cited at the beginning of
      this chapter suggest this direction. My conclusions based on Apter's views about mobilizing ideologies also
      could be reached by thinking about the conflict resolution needed to created international regimes. The dean of
      British peace researchers, Adam Curie, demonstrates that, paradoxically, in conflicts between apparently unequal
      parties, like the north-south conflict, a period of confrontation is necessary before the conflict can be
      resolved. The confrontation is needed in order for both parties to begin to take the weaker one as a serious
      partner whose interests will have to be <a id="page_151"></a>consulted in resolving the conflict.(<a href="#fn0368" id="bck_fn0368">96</a>) The oil price increases were such a confrontation. If they
      did nothing else, they made many northern policy makers aware of the third world's demands for the first
      time.
    </p>
<p>
      At times confrontations between previously weaker and previously stronger parties can make both equally powerful
      on all dimensions, but that is not essential to conflict resolution. It would be essential if the parties tried
      to resolve their conflict simply by exchanging concessions. A weaker party, with less to exchange, would find it
      difficult to get what it wanted from the stronger and could easily feel aggrieved by any bargained, temporary
      resolution.
    </p>
<p>
      If, on the other hand, the parties committed themselves to resolving their conflict by developing a single view
      of their mutual interests, rather than by exchanging concessions to partially satisfy their separate interests, a
      weaker and stronger party could, in theory, resolve their conflict to the full satisfaction of both. That would
      mean a commitment to substantive political debate, to trying to convince each other and to being willing to be
      convinced, something a good deal more complex than just exchanging concessions.(<a href="#fn0369" id="bck_fn0369">97</a>)
    </p>
<p>
      In fact, the conflicts among the states whose interests have to be satisfied in order to create an international
      regime must be resolved, at least in part, through substantive debate. The actual experience of the United States
      in founding the postwar system with its weaker western European partners illustrates the point. American policy
      makers may have tried just to strike bargains with their weaker partners and never amend U.S. views, but that was
      not enough. The U.S. convinced European leaders of the validity of the basic tenets of the system it was trying
      to create. It had to. Regimes are "principles, norms, rules, and decision-making procedures around which an
      actor's expectations converge in a given area of international relations."(<a href="#fn0370" id="bck_fn0370">98</a>) While it is possible for such principles, norms, and rules to be unconscious, it
      is unlikely that a regime of unconscious rules can be created when a conflict over different possible regimes has
      made states all the more conscious of strongly-held, conflicting views. International regimes can only be created
      out of a conscious disagreement over what regimes should be by consciously resolving that disagreement. That
      means by substantive political debate, not by mere bargaining that preserves the disagreement or by any other
      strategic action, like the OPEC price increases, alone.
    </p>
<p>
      To the extent that practical concerns continue to motivate the NIEO ideology, its advocates will be forced to
      recognize that substantive north-south debate on a formula for a new order is needed before international
      economic regimes can actually be reformed. The only significant innovations in the NIEO ideology since 1974
      <a id="page_152"></a>already point in that direction.

    The NIEO Ideology as Ideology</a></h1>
<p>
        . . . developing countries realize that their pattern of development will have to be different from that of the
        industrialized countries. They . . . adopt the present criteria of the industrialized countries as their target
        -- namely modernization and catching up with the rich. They pay the price — a dual society and wide income
        disparities — then frustration and instability. They carefully guard their recently acquired political
        independence and national identity, but they are the weaker partner, and hence the fear of domination — not
        only politically and economically, but even culturally.
      </p>
<p>
        — Ibrahim Helmi Abdel Rahman
      </p>
<p>
        The rejection of irrational constraints by each state had produced worldwide irrationality. At the same time
        the integration of the upper classes of developing countries into the international system has contributed to
        national dualism, national division, and national disintegration in some developing countries. Hence the call
        for "delinking" and the assertion of a national identity based on indigenous values.
      </p>
<p>
        — Paul Streeten(<a href="#fn0371" id="bck_fn0371">l</a>)
      </p>
<p>
      This final chapter recapitulates and summarizes what the NIEO ideology is before examining the global, national,
      and personal interests that the ideology serves. I reach the same conclusion as Streeten and former UNIDO
      Director Abdel Rahman: The NIEO ideology cannot be fully understood apart from the positions of developing
      countries within the international system, the position of its advocates within developing nations' domestic
      social systems, and the position of its <a id="page_158"></a>advocates within international society. The personal
      experiences many NIEO advocates share reinforce their commitment to the ideology they constructed to explain and
      try to transform the Bretton Woods system.
    </p>
<p>
      This discussion of the interests the new order ideology serves leads naturally into a discussion of the
      ideology's future. I discuss the most likely developments throughout this chapter to help illustrate
      fundamental elements of the ideology or the interests it serves. I leave more speculative discussion of the way
      the ideology might develop to the afterword.
    </p>
<h2 id="ht0036"><a href="#bck_ht0036">Key Elements of the New Order
    Ideology</a></h2>
<p>
      The NIEO ideology can be thought of as divided into two parts: A set of principles and a technical policy
      analysis. This analysis includes economic goals, factors affecting those goals, proposed economic policies
      designed to manipulate those factors, an analysis of political impediments to those policies, and political
      strategies to overcome those impediments. The new order technical analysis can be viewed as a rationally
      integrated unit, a causal model of the economic and political factors affecting third world economic
      goals.(<a href="#fn0372" id="bck_fn0372">2</a>) NIEO principles both define the need for and
      set moral limits on the NIEO policy analysis.
    </p>
<h3><span>New Order Principles</span></h3>
<p>
      Three new order principles have been part of the ideology since its beginning:
    </p>
<ul>
<li>- the need for international management of the global economy</li>
<li>- the economic rights and duties of states</li>
<li>- the equality of individual states</li>
</ul>
<p>
      The other two arose out of the compromises between more and less radical third world states when the Bretton
      Woods system began to break down at the beginning of the 1970s:
    </p>
<ul>
<li>- the moral obligation of past and present exploiters to negotiate the reform of existing international
      economic systems</li>
<li>- the duty of current exploiter states to compensate their victims</li>
</ul>
<p>
      The most fundamental NIEO principle, the need for some degree of rational international management of the <a id="page_159"></a>world economy, requires the creation of the NIEO policy analysis. It demands that analysis unlike
      the other NIEO principles which restrict it.
    </p>
<p>
      The second fundamental NIEO principle, the south's special version of the economic rights and duties of
      states, sets limits on that policy analysis. Under this principle the south affirms the rights of national
      governments to choose their own economic system and to control the natural resources within their territory. The
      most important duty of states remains to aid the economic development of materially less advantaged countries.
      The south often links this specific duty with the fundamental rights it affirms in formulas that encompass all
      elements of the second principle, such as, "the right to develop," "collective
      self-reliance," and "collective economic security." Other duties include protection of the global
      environment and other "common heritages."
    </p>
<p>
      A final fundamental NIEO principle affirms that separate states are equal in their rights and duties. As an
      instance of this principle, the south affirms that conflicts about international economic matters that cannot be
      resolved by appealing to economic science or to prior agreement on principle must be resolved by political means
      that treat each state as equally powerful, either majority rule of states or consensus.
    </p>
<p>
      The two more recent additions to the south's principles incorporate the restitution ethic proposed in the
      sixties by more radical nations. States that either have benefited from exploitation from third world regions in
      the past or continue to do so today have a moral obligation to reform the existing international economic system
      through negotiations. Likewise, those states that have continued such exploitative actions after the adoption of
      the General Assembly's Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States have a duty to compensate their
      victims directly.(<a href="#fn0373" id="bck_fn0373">3</a>)
    </p>
<h3><span>New Order Goals</span></h3>
<p>
      As Abdel Rahman states, the primary new order goal remains industrial development in the third world. NIEO
      advocates believe that the other benefits of modernization will flow from industry. Many other goals that third
      world spokesmen cite as elements of the new order program are simply means to encourage third world industry.
      Thus, meeting the basic needs of people throughout the world, working toward worldwide disarmament, maintaining
      the economic growth of developed nations, and preventing protectionism among DMC's are NIEO goals to the
      extent that they contribute to industrialization.
    </p>
<p>
      NIEO advocates consider other development goals even less important because proposing them as universale would
      contradict new order principles. For example, population <a id="page_160"></a>control can be an NIEO goal of some
      states because it may contribute to industrialization, but it cannot be a general NIEO goal because some third
      world states consider it anathema to the economic systems they have chosen.
    </p>
<h3><span>The New Order Analysis of the World Economy</span></h3>
<p>
      NIEO advocates consider the prospects for industrialization in the third world to be influenced by one major
      factor, the power the third world has over north-south economic transactions relative to the power developed
      countries have. NIEO advocates further divide that factor into three parts. The comparative power of north and
      south over trade appeared in NIEO analysis first, in the forties. The comparative power of north and south over
      development financing appeared only slightly later. Finally, new order advocates added a detailed analysis of the
      comparative power of north and south over TNC investment only after dependency scholars began their studies in
      the late sixties and early seventies. TNC investment influences the availability of technology for third world
      industrial development, a factor that NIEO advocates sometimes treat separately.
    </p>
<h3><span>Economic Policies Advocated as Part of the NIEO</span></h3>
<p>
      To increase the south's industrial capabilities, NIEO advocates have supported all forms of technical
      assistance since the foundation of the U.N. Most recently these have included programs to assure the free
      transfer of technology owned by northern governments. In an effort to assure that TNC investment can be used
      toward the same end, the south advocates a binding international code of conduct for TNCs. The code would
      increase the power of third world governments relative to that of firms based in the developed world.
    </p>
<p>
      In order to increase the relative power of the third world over north-south trade, the south advocates that
      tariff preferences continue to be granted to the developing states. The south also supports the IPC's program
      of commodity agreements backed by a unified system of financing buffer stocks in order to discourage the
      competition among southern producers of raw materials and thus avoid downward trends in the prices of third world
      goods (at the expense of dampening upward price movements as well, it should be added). The south also supports
      any direct action by third world raw material producers to maintain and raise prices whenever possible, although
      OPEC's successes have yet to be repeated.
    </p>
<p>
      In order to increase the relative power of the south over development financing, third world governments have
      consistently supported channeling all aid through multilateral institutions. Third world concerns for <a id="page_161"></a>disarmament and for maintaining economic growth in developed countries have to be understood as
      ways to assure or increase multilateral aid. The SDR-Link proposal serves the same function; the NIEO desire to
      increase the power of the IMF to that of a global central bank should be understood primarily as a means to make
      the Link feasible. Southern proposals for both generalized and individual debt relief would increase the power of
      third world states over development financing more directly. The south's support of compensatory financing
      for trade income shortfalls and other financial and monetary reforms of the Bretton Woods system also serve the
      same end of increasing southern power over development financing.
    </p>
<h3><span>The New Order Political Strategy</span></h3>
<p>
      Except for direct action on prices by third world commodity producers, all of the major NIEO economic policies
      require north-south cooperation. Thus, since 1974 the south's political strategy has evolved into one of
      negotiation. The south has integrated earlier concerns with direct action and attempts to influence northern
      opinion into an overall strategy for negotiation. Earlier strategies are now used to help build consensus in the
      north that negotiation is necessary. The south remains wary of conducting negotiations in forums and under rules
      that do not give it an advantage. Nonetheless, the futility of that position has made NIEO advocates move
      continually closer to accepting a process of negotiation that would allow the south's new order program to be
      amended, the system of global negotiations based on a framework consensus in the General Assembly, to be followed
      by separate negotiations within each of the specialized agencies of the U.N. that deal with economic matters,
      under rules designed to achieve conciliation between north and south.
    </p>
<h3><span>Elements of the NIEO Ideology Most Likely to Change</span></h3>
<p>
      The changes in new order strategy visible in the last decade should not be surprising. The fundamental NIEO
      commitment to rational policy analysis assures that, within the boundaries established by other new order
      principles, policies that fail will be discarded. No southern strategy for achieving the NIEO has worked yet.
      Consequently, we should expect the south to experiment with new strategies.
    </p>
<p>
      Likewise, the commitment to rational policy analysis assures that the south will abandon or replace the economic
      policies if they prove unsuccessful in achieving the south's goals. As of yet, no NIEO policy proposal has
      been completely abandoned? none has been proven a failure in practice, and economists still disagree over the
      <a id="page_162"></a>probable effects of the proposals. Nonetheless, even the economic analysis of critics of the
      NIEO gives us reason to believe that the south will add new economic policy proposals in the future.
    </p>
<p>
      A 1979 Overseas Development Council study of all the NIEO policies then proposed concluded that even if all were
      enacted, they would assure only a moderate increase in third world per capita income. (<a href="#fn0374" id="bck_fn0374">4</a>) To the extent that per capita income is a reliable indicator of third world
      development goals, and (as Abdel Rahman suggests) it probably is, NIEO advocates will have to find additional
      means to achieve their goals.
    </p>
<p>
      Another group of northern economists recently concluded that the NIEO policies would work primarily to the
      benefit of the most developed third world states.(<a href="#fn0375" id="bck_fn0375">5</a>) To
      the extent that the new order alliance remains committed to its principle of the equal treatment of states? such
      unequal benefits would be unacceptable, assuring that additional policies would have to be adopted.
    </p>
<p>
      These probable changes in NIEO strategy and economic analysis would result directly from the confrontation
      between the new order ideology and reality. Another change in the ideology could arise from a conflict within the
      ideology itself. Yet it might take substantive debate between north and south to make NIEO advocates worry about
      that conflict.
    </p>
<p>
      The conflict appears in the confused relationships among some of the NIEO principles. New order advocates take a
      realm of rational management of the world economy to be necessary, but circumscribe that realm by the principle
      that states are equal in their economic rights and duties. The relationship between the realm of management and
      the realm of the economic rights and duties of states remains unclear.
    </p>
<p>
      Conceivably, the realm of international management could be understood as completely subservient to equal
      states' rights, meaning that any individual state would have a right to contradict the rational management
      policies of the NIEO. The south's continual affirmations of state sovereignty and proposals to let any state
      have effective veto over proposed NIEO reforms suggests that interpretation. But as Keynes pointed out nearly
      forty years ago, the absolute subjection of international institutions to the will of even one nation-state
      contradicts the idea that there are global needs that only rational global economic management can meet. An NIEO
      based on the principle that global management must be absolutely subservient to the policies of national
      governments would simply institutionalize the system Streeten already sees as existent, a world in which state
      interventions to rationalize national economies are expected, yet no coherent effort can be made to rationalize
      the separate policies of separate states.
    </p>
<p>
<a id="page_163"></a>The south might only wish to affirm that the realm of equal states ' rights creates
      boundaries on the realm of economic management. That appears to be what NIEO supporters argue when they say that
      specific policies, like birth control, cannot be adopted as a quid pro quo for aid from international
      institutions.
    </p>
<p>
      To make that relationship clear the NIEO ideology would not only have to specify the economic rights and duties
      of states, it would also have to specify the rights and duties of international economic institutions, thus
      specifying the boundaries of the realm of rational management of the world economy. In fact the dialogue over
      global negotiations might result in such a clarification since the northern powers opposed to the south's
      formula, the U.S., U.K., and West German, couch their opposition in terms of support of the integrity of existing
      international economic institutions. Agreement on the specific limits on the autonomous realms of international
      economic institutions would overcome the existing impasse in negotiations.
    </p>
<h3><span>Elements of the Ideology Likely to Remain Unchanged</span></h3>
<p>
      Even if some parts of the NIEO ideology might change as a result of negotiations, the history of the ideology
      suggests that others will not change as long as the third world alliance remains. Some of the elements appear to
      be permanent simply because they have been part of the ideology since its beginning. The third world goal of
      industrial development has been affirmed by native governments in Asia, Africa, and Latin America since the
      depression. The goal was part of the ideology of independent Asian, African, and Latin American governments at
      the U.N. even before they adopted NIEO principles. Similarly, the principles of international management and the
      equality of states in their rights and duties have been part of the ideology from the beginning. We have no way
      of conceiving of the ideology without them.
    </p>
<p>
      Recognizing the goal of third world industrial development and the fundamental NIEO principles as permanent
      elements of the ideology, we could conceive that its adherents might abandon their belief that differences in
      power over north-south economic transactions explain the industrialization of the north and the lack of industry
      in the south if further study (authorized by the principle of rational policy analysis) proved this assumption
      false.
    </p>
<p>
      Nonetheless, I believe this analysis may be as fundamental to the new order ideology as any other element. It
      does more than help explain the south's lack of development; it helps define the identity that members of the
      third world alliance share. All have similar grievances with the present economic order. It is not <a id="page_164"></a>just that some third world states were colonies when the present order was created while others
      were independent but rarely consulted by those who created the system; more importantly, all third world states
      suffered from a similar position in the world political economy as a whole. The analysis makes third world
      countries appear as natural allies. Appeals to similar grievances, or even to a similar desire for development,
      would not suggest the need for alliance the way a claim to a similar history does.
    </p>
<h3><span>The New Internationalism</span></h3>
<p>
      Many of those who have studied the NIEO ideology before have tried to capture its most permanent elements in an
      even more abstract form than the outline above, labeling the ideology with the name of an older, more familiar
      philosophy. After all, as Clifford Geertz says when discussing ideology itself, we often expand knowledge by
      giving something new an old name.(<a href="#fn0376" id="bck_fn0376">6</a>)
    </p>
<p>
      But none of the old names offered for the NIEO ideology are quite satisfying. Even calling the ideology a
      "new internationalism," and meaning by that that it is a more coherent expression of the
      "internationalism" identified by Sukarno and Nehru in the fifties, would not be completely accurate.
      Nonetheless, illustrating the ways in which the labels do or do not fit can help clarify what the NIEO ideology
      is, and even what it might become.
    </p>
<p>
      The NIEO ideology resembles Fabianism, as Daniel Patrick Moynihan first recognized,(<a href="#fn0377" id="bck_fn0377">7</a>) in that it supports social controls on the market. Despite the claims of some
      northern economists, the NIEO ideology certainly suggests no more bureaucratization and control of the global
      economy than Fabians advocate for domestic economies in developed countries. The market remains central. NIEO
      trade proposals rely on the market. Third world officials ignore straightforward proposals for fixing prices,
      such as having an international agency empowered to set prices and penalize violators, the way wage and price
      controls work within many countries.
    </p>
<p>
      But "Fabianism" fails to capture the NIEO ideology for the same reason "international
      Keynesianism" or any other global form of corporatism does. The role of the state in the new ideology
      differs. The NIEO ideology justifies a compact of states, not a compact of classes, sectors, or individuals.
      Keynes's vision of what Fred Block calls "internationally organized state capitalism"(<a href="#fn0378" id="bck_fn0378">8</a>) was designed to overcome the resistance of national
      governments to a realm of rational management of the world economy by creating cross-national class coalitions.
      Fabians, who emphasize the political equality of individuals, might imagine the same possibility. NIEO advocates,
      who are concerned more about the equal <a id="page_165"></a>treatment of states, could not.
    </p>
<p>
      For similar reasons, attempts to justify or criticize the NIEO ideology on the basis of John Rawls's liberal
      theory of justice fail to correctly characterize the ideology. Rawls argues that if people chose social rules
      without knowing their own position in society they would meet all basic needs and only let the well off gain when
      the least advantaged gained as well.(<a href="#fn0379" id="bck_fn0379">9</a>) But NIEO
      supporters only advocate basic needs development as a means toward another end, not, as Rawls does, as a goal in
      itself. Extended to be an ethic of international relations, Rawls's theory justifies duties of individuals in
      one state to individuals in other states.(<a href="#fn0380" id="bck_fn0380">10</a>) It does
      not address the NIEO claims about the rights and duties of states to each other.
    </p>
<p>
      Critics who call the NIEO ideology "mercantilism" can deal with the rights of states, at least as they
      are reflected in the western tradition of international law.(<a href="#fn0381" id="bck_fn0381">11</a>) But the NIEO ideology defines duties of states that go beyond respecting others'
      rights. And the central concern of the new order ideology remains the activities of international institutions
      designed to help manage the world economy, something traditional mercantilists never thought of. Calling the NIEO
      ideology "mercantilism" also fails to capture the notion of positive duties of states toward one
      another, something the other proposed names for the ideology ignore as well.
    </p>
<p>
      Calling the ideology a "new internationalism" emphasizes the positive duties by recalling the contrast
      with cosmopolitanism that Sukarno outlined in the 1950s. Sukarno sought to maintain the cultural diversity and
      cultural autonomy of existing groups. "Internationalism" is even more appropriate to the NIEO ideology
      than to Sukarno's domestic governing ideology. The NIEO aims to preserve only the cultural diversity and
      autonomy of nation-states, not of cultures which exist subnationally.
    </p>
<p>
      While "new internationalism" does not capture many of the elements of the NIEO ideology, especially the
      role of government as the sole legitimate definer of culture, it does suggest some new ways to understand the
      ideology. Just as there is a larger universe of philosophical writings on the ethics of social democracy and
      liberalism to which the "Fabian" and "Rawlsian" parts of the NIEO debate can be compared,
      many arguments about the need for maintaining cultural diversity exist.(<a href="#fn0382" id="bck_fn0382">12</a>)
    </p>
<p>
      Even a Rawlsian argument for the ethics of the new internationalism could be constructed: Individuals deciding
      upon social rules would take into account that their culture will give them their identity. They may choose a
      world in which cultures, including their own, can die out in competition with others. Or they may choose a world
      which fosters cultural diversity through collective self-reliance, an NIEO-like alternative. To avoid alienation
      they would choose the NIEO.
    </p>
<p>
<a id="page_166"></a>This example is not chosen as the most compelling justification for the ethics of the new
      internationalism,(<a href="#fn0383" id="bck_fn0383">13</a>) but because it helps illustrate
      where potential sources of change in the new order ideology can exist outside the ideology itself. They appear in
      the interests of the those who advocate the ideology, the interests that the ideology helps them understand. In
      this case, as Abdel Rahman and Streeten both suggest, for some NIEO advocates, partial integration into the
      global upper class comes at the cost of cultural alienation, which, like any real concern NIEO advocates have,
      could become the basis for new ideological innovations.
    </p>
<p>
      Yet the personal concerns that NIEO advocates share would not be the first thing to consider when looking for the
      interests underlying the NIEO ideology. That is why the notion that creating a personal philosophy to deal with
      cultural alienation might be the primary source of new NIEO innovations does not quite ring true.
    </p>
<p>
      I chose this example to illustrate that the new order's third world advocates can be thought of as sharing
      different interests, each apparent only at one level of analysis. They may share common personal interests based
      on their personal experience as members of a global elite. They also may share both conflicting and convergent
      interests as members of the governing elite of separate states. Finally they may share interests as leaders of
      nations that have a similar position in the world system.
    </p>
<p>
      Given the global focus of the new order ideology it make little sense to begin explaining its nature, origin, and
      future in terms of common domestic interests or similar personal experiences, even though some analysts have
      tried to explain NIEO doctrine by beginning at one of the less inclusive levels.(<a href="#fn0384" id="bck_fn0384">14</a>) A more straightforward strategy involves going from the more inclusive to less
      inclusive levels of analysis, using purely domestic interests to explain only what cannot be explained as a
      result of common interests created by the world system and using common personal experiences to explain only what
      cannot be explained at both more inclusive levels. That is the strategy I follow below.
    </p>
<h2 id="ht0045"><a href="#bck_ht0045">Interests Underlying the NIEO
    Ideology</a></h2>
<p>
      The explanation for the emergence of the NIEO ideology offered in the introduction emphasizes interests third
      world officials share due to the similar positions of their states within the world system. It may have only been
      coincidence that the earliest new order advocates shared an interest in global regimes that would foster their
      industrial development. Nonetheless, the global process of agreeing upon postwar regimes assured that all <a id="page_167"></a>of them would become subject to the Bretton Woods system, yet be the only group of states subject
      to the system to have grievances with it from the very beginning.
    </p>
<p>
      To define both those grievances and the reason for their alliance, the early new order supporters adopted the
      fundamental NIEO principles and the basic NIEO analysis of the world economy while the Bretton Woods system was
      still being created. Problems NIEO advocates suffered partially as a result of the operation of the Bretton Woods
      system triggered further amplification of their economic analysis. The alliance began to develop a shared
      political strategy and an analysis upon which it was based only after its members became conscious of a
      collective identity.
    </p>
<p>
      The first signs of the breakdown of the Bretton Woods system reinforced the alliance's identity, overcoming
      its members' conflicting national interests and convincing alliance members of the need to become more
      militant as well as more unified. When the alliance's systemically defined opposition, the north, began to
      fracture deeply as many northern governments and members of the northern nongovernmental elite began to support
      the third world program, the alliance slowly began to moderate its views to take some of its former
      opponents' interests into account and to emphasize more mutual means for resolving the systemic problems that
      the NIEO ideology identified and by which it was motivated.
    </p>
<h3><span>The Ideology's Function at a Global Level</span></h3>
<p>
      As it is summarized above, the emergence of the NIEO ideology was part of the emergence of the third world as a
      relatively autonomous actor in world politics. Karl Deutsch's way of identifying autonomous actors(<a href="#fn0385" id="bck_fn0385">15</a>) illustrates how the ideology was able to play this role
      and suggests the limits of the third world as an actor.
    </p>
<p>
      Deutsch says that four functions of "consciousness" must be performed by a person or collectivity —
      e.g., corporation, party, nation, alliance -- that acts autonomously. It must have (1) memory and (2) ways to
      easily recall information from it. The actor must also have (3) ways to learn and (4) means to assure that what
      is learned can enter memory, what is remembered can influence what is learned, and what has been recalled is
      remembered. Memory provides the actor with a way to store both its goals and what it has learned about previous
      attempts to achieve them. The actor's openness to new information assures that it can develop strategies
      because it will be able to create a record of successes and failures upon which a strategy can be based. Means of
      assuring the constant transmission of information assure that both memory and learning can play their assigned
      roles.
    </p>
<p>
      The NIEO ideology helps serve two of these functions <a id="page_168"></a>for the third world. It is that part of
      the memory of the third world alliance within international organizations that officials can actually carry with
      them. At the same time the ideology's principle that rational policy analysis be used to guide global
      economic decision making helps assure that the third world alliance remains open to new information, that it has
      the capacity to learn.
    </p>
<p>
      Despite the significance of the NIEO ideology, other things contribute to these functions as well: The
      "memory" of the third world alliance within international organizations, the record of its goals, and
      what it has learned in the past also depend on the existence of a third world intellectual community including
      scholars, university officials, and publishers concerned with third world goals. The U.N. Secretariats and
      regional economic commissions also help play the same role. The research norms of social scientists interested in
      third world goals help assure that the alliance remains open to new information. The rapidly changing economic
      environment third world states found themselves in under the evolving Bretton Woods system contributed as well.
      And the existence of conflicts among third world governments required the alliance to either learn or break
      apart.
    </p>
<p>
      The ability of third world officials to consult the alliance's broader memory and the ease with which they
      agree upon lessons to be remembered has less to do with the NIEO ideology. Rather, the smooth functioning of
      these links in the alliance's "consciousness" was facilitated by the existence of the U.N.
      professional staffs, the development of personal trust among specific third world officials as they worked with
      each other through repeated conferences, the fact that any two third world representatives in the U.N. system
      could find at least one language they both knew, and the existence of common genres -- the resolutions and set
      phrases upon which so much of the debate within international organizations tends to focus.
    </p>
<p>
      In summary, the NIEO ideology functions as a key part of the "consciousness" of the third world. But,
      of course, "the third world" that has this consciousness only acts within certain arenas in the
      international system, especially in international organizations where economic matters are discussed.
    </p>
<p>
      This application of Deutsch's criteria suggests that the reality of the third world as an international actor
      is a bit different than many opponents of the NIEO have often assumed. For example, the existence of the third
      world as an international actor dedicated to the goals of the NIEO ideology could not be ended by pulling members
      out of the alliance. "Graduating" the more developed third world countries, say the OPEC countries and
      the newly industrialized nations, such as Singapore, into the developed world by giving them the rights and
      duties that northern states enjoy under Bretton Woods would do <a id="page_169"></a>nothing to abolish the
      memory, ways of learning, and links of consciousness which allow the third world to act. Even if officials of
      graduated states gave up the NIEO ideology, the third world would continue as an actor made up of other states.
      Convincing LLDC officials to call themselves a "fourth world" would do even less to the integrity of
      the third world as international actor. It would reinforce some of the conflict within the third world, but that
      conflict itself may be functional as something that keeps the alliance open to new information.
    </p>
<p>
      A concerted attempt to abolish the third world as an international actor, without transforming the system to
      which the NIEO ideology emerged as a reaction, would have to involve destroying the other factors that contribute
      to the alliance's "consciousness." Such an effort might include destroying the third world
      intellectual community, abolishing the international organization staffs interested in NIEO issues, stabilizing
      the economic environment in which third world states find themselves, reducing the frequency of international
      meetings on economic matters, and frequently changing the standard procedures for conducting remaining meetings.
      In sum, the third world probably could not be destroyed as an international actor without either transforming the
      Bretton Woods system to take into account third world grievances, or else transforming the rest of the postwar
      system of international organizations that deal with economic matters in such a way that NIEO issues cannot be
      raised.
    </p>
<p>
      This implies that the third world and its NIEO ideology will be a factor in international politics for some time
      to come. That makes it particularly important to point out the difference between the third world as an
      international actor and something that that international actor is not, a direct representative of the collective
      consciousness of all the people in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Nothing like "third worldism"
      exists as powerfully as the nationalism that can be found in almost any nation. No third world ideology
      influences the mass of people within the third world the way the NIEO ideology influences third world elites
      within international economic organizations. Deutsch's criteria can help illustrate the difference.
    </p>
<p>
      Probably most people throughout Asia, Africa, and Latin America have been exposed to the NIEO ideology,
      Especially in the late seventies, government-sponsored radio throughout the third world constantly discussed the
      NIEO program. (<a href="#fn0386" id="bck_fn0386">16</a>) But otherwise, few people in the
      third world had a source of memories about the third world as a whole. To a certain extent popular music in the
      south Atlantic basin -- Latin America, Africa, and the Caribbean -- records and retells third world rather than
      regional or national themes. And Islamic revival <a id="page_170"></a>movements from Africa east to the Pacific
      tell and retell a history of a single struggle across much of the third world. Yet neither locus of popular
      transnational memory within the third world encompasses all regions and can be consulted by everyone.
    </p>
<p>
      Third world officials who want to remember third world goals and the lessons of past attempts to achieve them can
      consult books, U.N. documents, or the memory of colleagues. Most people only have access to what they and those
      near them remember of government broadcasts. And since the international forums where third world problems are
      discussed provide so few opportunities for popular input — especially for people who are poor and distant — few
      people in the third world have any good reason to spend time trying to learn about changing third world
      interests, let alone about changing attempts to achieve them.
    </p>
<p>
      Moreover, those in the third world outside government who do take the time to learn face impediments to sharing
      knowledge. They cannot transform the third world "consciousness" with what they learn. No systems of
      translators, frequent meetings, or standard procedures exist to let poor people in one part of the third world
      share their views with poor people in another. In most countries no such systems exist even to allow the poor to
      share their views with government officials.
    </p>
<p>
      The third world as an international actor, then, is based on a coalition among elites, and the NIEO ideology is
      an elite ideology. The possible set of those who could actually have affected the way the ideology emerged and,
      thus, whose interests are likely to be apprehended by it, is limited to those people within the third world who
      have access to at least some of the other factors which contribute to the alliance's autonomy — the southern
      intellectual community and the resources and meetings of international economic organizations.
    </p>
<h3><span>National Interests and the NIEO Ideology</span></h3>
<p>
      Third world interests generated by the global system — the creation, operation, and breakdown of the Bretton
      Woods system -- explain most of the history of NIEO ideology. The Bretton Woods system appeared to thwart
      development goals all third world governments shared. However, that systemic explanation does not tell us why
      third world governments tended to share some goals in the first place. To do that requires going below the level
      of the international system and identifying the domestic interests to which third world governments responded.
      Even if the southern states' similar goals have a "global" source, we can assume that each
      individual third world government adopted its goals in response to domestic pressures.
    </p>
<p>
      The goals of a government's foreign policy which <a id="page_171"></a>respond to domestic pressure are
      usually called the "national interest." Wentworth Ofuatey-Kodjoe argues that the most straightforward
      operational definition of a country's "national interest" would have researchers find out which
      people foreign policy makers think of as the "nation" when they make foreign policy, and then find out
      what that group considers to be its interests. Empirically, a country's national interest usually is the
      self-defined interests of those who keep the government in power.(<a href="#fn0387" id="bck_fn0387">17</a>)
    </p>
<p>
      In most third world countries the governing coalition's interests are expressed in a national development
      plan. Part of the strength of the NIEO ideology, of course, is that can justify almost any national development
      plan. The only constants across national development plans that NIEO ideology seems to demand are some
      affirmation of the desirability of national cultural autonomy (the new internationalism) and some relatively
      central position for industrial development. These, in fact, are constants across third world development
      plans.(<a href="#fn0388" id="bck_fn0388">18</a>)
    </p>
<p>
      Superficially, these two constant elements seem to appeal to conflicting domestic interests. Affirmation of the
      need for industrial development appears to posit development away from rural areas where farmers — the majority
      of people in most third world countries — live, and where "traditional" elites base their power on
      indigenous customs of land ownership and labor contract. Affirmations of cultural autonomy, on the other hand,
      appear designed to strengthen the "traditional" elites' power bases and focus development on the
      countryside.(<a href="#fn0389" id="bck_fn0389">19</a>)
    </p>
<p>
      Yet third world cultural nationalist development ideologies rarely focus on the countryside. Instead of
      strengthening customary elites the ideologies often weaken them at the expense of central government which acts
      as the sole definer of the national culture. Even if ideologies of national cultural autonomy were created by
      people who did not even covertly desire to strengthen the power of the state, they invariably serve that function
      because the government uses its ability to define the national cultural as a means to reward allies and exclude
      opponents.(<a href="#fn0390" id="bck_fn0390">20</a>) In the process, the government need never
      contradict the interests of the governing coalition based in urban areas and interested in industrialization
      whether that coalition be centered on local or foreign entrepreneurs, industrial workers, merchants, petty wage
      earners, or even the unemployed.
    </p>
<p>
      More rarely, a government can pursue both an overt interest in industrial development and a covert interest in
      strengthening the state without even being based on a coalition centered in urban areas. As long as its coalition
      accepts that industrial development is a key to increasing aggregate wealth and that the coalition will gain the
      benefits of that development, perhaps through <a id="page_172"></a>the government's redistributive policies,
      the core of the governing coalition can be any sector, urban or rural. The key is the combination of the two
      interests served by constants across all the development doctrines the NIEO ideology justifies: industrial
      development and strengthening the state.
    </p>
<p>
      Immanuel Wallerstein argues that unless a region is "invited" to develop by international investors,
      the only other normal path to the "core" of the world economy requires both industrialization and
      strengthening the state. He even argues that to follow the least likely to succeed of the three available paths
      is to honestly pursue self-reliant development.(<a href="#fn0391" id="bck_fn0391">21</a>) For
      governments that do that, affirmations of cultural nationalism need not become simply a means to strengthen the
      state.
    </p>
<p>
      Wallerstein imbeds his view within a complex theory of the development of the world economy, but his whole theory
      need not be accepted to accept the centrality of these two goals. Even if development is taken to mean simply
      increasing wealth, the labor savings that come from the introduction of industrial techniques make that possible.
      And, as Ε. B. Ayal argues, industrialization no longer can be carried out solely in the interests of individual
      entrepreneurs. Demands for redistribution of new wealth are too all pervasive. Only very rare third world
      governments, even those governing the most dualistic society with the widest income disparities, can govern
      without the occasional backing of at least some of the nation's poorest sectors. Development in modern states
      has to be something of a collectivist process. And the cultural nationalist doctrines which the NIEO ideology
      justifies help the state create the specific form of collectivism its own supporters demand.(<a href="#fn0392" id="bck_fn0392">22</a>)
    </p>
<p>
      Thus, an excursion into domestic interests underlying the NIEO ideology takes us back to the international
      system, not to the Bretton Woods system, but to the older "world economy" characterized by development
      in some regions and underdevelopment in others. The development goals the NIEO ideology supports may be
      politically astute throughout the third world. Unless third world governments choose to rely on "development
      by invitation," they may well have interests in industrialization and strengthening the state no matter what
      specific coalition of social forces maintains the government in power.
    </p>
<p>
      There are other ways to explain those domestic interests shared by third world governments and expressed by the
      NIEO ideology. Some critics of the new order argue that third world governments offer it to their domestic
      supporters in lieu of development. Such arguments run parallel to John Nellis's convincing assessment of the
      functions of Tanzania's domestic ideology; it lets rural Tanzaniane participate in a social experiment they
      can tell is of world historical significance even though it <a id="page_173"></a>has little chance of success.
      The governing elite in Tanzania, Nellis argues, has used the opportunity created by the way the ideology reduced
      material demands to secure a more prominant position.(<a href="#fn0393" id="bck_fn0393">23</a>)
    </p>
<p>
      Certainly the NIEO ideology helps strengthen the state and its functionaries, just as did the domestic ideology
      that Nellis studied. But the words of the NIEO ideology would not be as readily acceptable in lieu of real
      development as the Tanzanian development doctrine is. The NIEO ideology, even when publicly promulgated over
      government radio, can offer very few people a sense of participation in something historically important. It
      invites no public participation. It does not require third world publics to uproot villages, change habits of
      production, or even to continue to listen to the radio. Perhaps the NIEO ideology offered some third world
      diplomats at international conferences a sense of participation in world historical changes in lieu of the sense
      of competence that might come from successfully negotiating north-south agreements. That trade off might have
      been in the interests of central governments opposed to the kind of north-south agreements that have actually
      been possible up to now. But the same process could not work to quell the demands of any other group within a
      third world country in the same way, simply because the NIEO ideology does not offer participation to anyone
      else.
    </p>
<p>
      Of course, it could be that the NIEO ideology's only real function within a third world country is to deflect
      criticism from the government, to, as Caribbean dependency theorist Havelock Brewster puts it, blame the
      developed countries for the third world government's inherent inability to control the economy. Certainly, in
      an extremely facile sense, that is true. Adherents to the NIEO ideology do blame the international system for
      their inability to set and meet national development goals, just as Brewster says.(<a href="#fn0394" id="bck_fn0394">24</a>) But the persistence and the ubiquity of the new order ideology throughout the
      third world argue against explaining it solely as a tool to deflect domestic criticism. It could not be used
      successfully for that purpose for long. As Ofuatey-Kodjoe says, in a world of ubiquitous dependence third world
      citizens judge their governments on the basis of what they have done with the cards the international system
      deals them; a Ghanaian is less interested in the dependence both Ghana and the Ivory Coast equally suffer than in
      the reasons why the Ivorian government seems to have done better than any Ghanaian government has.(<a href="#fn0395" id="bck_fn0395">25</a>) To believe that the NIEO ideology has existed for nearly
      forty years merely as a tool to deflect domestic criticism from third world governments is to have little faith
      in the intelligence either of third world officials or of third world citizens.
    </p>
<p>
      Having some faith in both, I doubt that attempts to <a id="page_174"></a>deflect domestic criticism can explain
      everything in the NIEO ideology, or even those few common elements in all third world development doctrines that
      are not explained by the NIEO ideology's history as a reaction to Bretton Woods. Instead, I suspect the
      desire for industrial development and the desire to strengthen the state appear to have been almost universal
      lessons of mid-twentieth century domestic politics throughout the south. If we could compare the process of
      government formation in state after state -- sequences of parties formed by or forming coalitions of domestic
      social forces, coming to power and then remaining, or perhaps reorganizing or falling -- we should expect to find
      that any stable government, no matter what groups make up its governing coalition, would be one that wanted these
      things that the NIEO ideology supports. Unfortunately, investigation of that hypothesis has to await further
      research.(<a href="#fn0397" id="bck_fn0397">27</a>)
    </p>
<h3><span>The Personal Experience of Third World Officials</span></h3>
<p>
      Given that no one has done research to determine if the new order ideology responds to third world domestic
      concerns other than the typical government's desire to deflect public criticism, I may have passed over that
      hypothesis too quickly. The argument really is less about pressures on third world governments from domestic
      politics than it is one about common personal characteristics of third world leaders, in this case, a common
      desire to deflect criticism rather than to accept it and respond to it directly. I now turn to personal
      characteristics new order advocates may have in common. As I argued above, given the global focus of the NIEO
      ideology, we should begin to look for its explanation at more inclusive levels of analysis. Little of the
      ideology's history remains to be explained below the level of the world system. What remains can be explained
      as the coordination of domestic interests, which have a systemic source as well. The following summary of some of
      the personal concerns that many third world advocates of the NIEO share simply reinforces this explanation of the
      nature and rise of the NIEO ideology.
    </p>
<p>
      The desire to deflect popular criticism of failed development policies may, indeed, be a trait third world
      advocates of the new order share. It may be one way of coping with the peculiar position in world society in
      which they find themselves, the position mentioned in both quotations at the head of this chapter, political and
      economic leaders recognize they are part of a global elite, yet have good reason to consider themselves victims
      within global society. They identify with the vast majority of people around the world who are the most
      victimized by the present structure of global society, yet third world political and economic leaders recognize
      themselves as contributing to the victimization of the <a id="page_175"></a>least advantaged. Before suggesting
      how this peculiar position might generate beliefs and actions which could influence the NIEO ideology, let me
      justify the way I characterized it.
    </p>
<p>
      That third world economic and political leaders are part of a global elite should not be controversial. The
      dualism within most third world economies assures that the advantages of the most advantaged people in the south
      are similar to those of most advantaged people in the north. Third world leaders have had access to the same
      education that leaders of wealthy states have. Economists meeting to discuss north-south matters may represent
      all the countries of the world, but they are likely to represent only the most prestigious handful of the
      world's universities.(<a href="#fn0397">27</a>) And, to a certain extent, to understand
      the personal dynamics of the General Assembly meeting on economic matters involves understanding the concerns of
      one of the most privileged classes in the city at the center of the world economy, New York.
    </p>
<p>
      That third world economic and political leaders are victims might be less apparent. But the victimization of the
      most frequent promoters of the NIEO ideology, the representatives of third world governments at international
      economic meetings, can be demonstrated easily. C. Clyde Ferguson, an American representative at the United
      Nations during the Carter years, points out that the vast majority of representatives at any north-south
      conference will have grown up in colonial societies. "Some even have vivid memories of signs — 'No
      Natives, No Dogs.'"(<a href="#fn0398" id="bck_fn0398">28</a>) Even many of those who
      grew up in independent states lived through periods when their nation was wracked by military intervantions from
      countries in the north. And despite the very similar education that all the people who take part in economic
      debates within international organizations have, all third world representatives have had to suffer the typical
      condescension of their colleagues from wealthy nations. As Sidney Weintraub noted even during the cooperative
      early sixties, northern delegates to global economic conferences have trouble resisting their desire to lecture
      those who appear to have so much to learn about development.(<a href="#fn0399" id="bck_fn0399">29</a>) Ferguson adds that most experienced diplomats recognize that a peculiar sort of
      racism creates tension underneath even the most cooperative north-south meetings on economic matters.(<a href="#fn0400" id="bck_fn0400">30</a>) The coincidence that most Group of 77 states are populated
      by nonwhites or dark skinned Caucasians lets northerners, including some sympathetic to the third world, express
      their normal condescension as racism.
    </p>
<p>
      The victimization that third world economic and political leaders have suffered and continue to suffer assures
      that most will identify with the more completely victimized majority within their own country. In fact, those
      scholars who argue that third world elite concerns <a id="page_176"></a>with national cultural autonomy
      inadvertently lead to a highly functional strengthening of the state, also argue that in case after case
      throughout the third world the elite's initial concern with national cultural autonomy came from an attempt
      to identify with the country's least advantaged. That identification, in turn, provided a partial
      psychological resolution of the conflict created by being both a member of the world's colonial or
      neocolonial elite and its victim.(<a href="#fn0401" id="bck_fn0401">31</a>) There is no reason
      to believe that new members of any third world nation's elite cannot find the same reasons for identifying,
      in part, with the least advantaged and thus, not incidentally, come to reinforce one of the key principles of the
      new order ideology.
    </p>
<p>
      Unfortunately for themselves, many people who govern third world states cannot retain an unambiguous personal
      identification with their country's least advantaged. Some officials consciously and actively take part in
      the victimization of the majority in order to maintain their dominant position. Others, perhaps including the
      Tanzanian officials whose behavior Nellis explains so well, find that the act of governing condemns them to
      victimize their fellow citizens (at least at times) with taxes, nonremunerative production prices, high consumer
      prices, or exclusions from social services that others receive.
    </p>
<p>
      Those who try to cope with this contradiction between identifying with the most victimized yet consciously
      contributing to their victimization might decide to deflect popular criticism of their inability to better
      control the economy by pointing to the international system as the source of the problem and demanding the NIEO
      as its solution. Equally, says critic of Caribbean dependency theory G. E. Cumper, they might decide to become
      academic dependency theorists, retain their position in the global social elite, continue criticizing the world
      economy, yet also be able to criticize officials of third world governments for their "contradictory"
      and "self-serving" views.(<a href="#fn0402" id="bck_fn0402">32</a>)
    </p>
<p>
      Parenthetically, even though either of these ideological solutions would be "self-serving" in the sense
      that it would mean adopting beliefs in order to cope with a personal dilemma without first testing to see if the
      beliefs are valid, there is no reason why beliefs adopted in that way have to be invalid. That is a separate
      question. I indirectly addressed it in this book whenever I illustrated that NIEO advocates look for explanations
      of new problems only among those not excluded by the ideological constraint of their prior consensus.
      Nonetheless, for the purposes of this book, the influence of personal experiences on the NIEO ideology has
      significance not as a means to test the ideology's analysis, but as a means to test my own thesis about the
      ideology's origin.
    </p>
<p>
<a id="page_177"></a>The test cannot be completely conclusive because the personal interests that third world
      NIEO advocates have because of their position in international society suggest nothing new. parts of the new
      order ideology appear overdetermined. Or, to put it more precisely, third world NIEO advocates may have been able
      to resolve personal dilemmas as well as solve problems created by systemic forces when they adopted two of the
      key characteristics of the NIEO ideology, its concern for aiding national cultural autonomy and its focus on
      systemic rather than domestic impediments to industrial development.
    </p>
<p>
      Personal, state, and global interests combine to create the NIEO ideology. The ideology's content and origin
      are best understood first as a reaction to the positions of third world states both within the Bretton Woods
      system of institutions managing the global economy since the second world war and within the older, more
      inclusive world economy as a whole. That is why the ideology's history fits so easily within the frameworks
      provided by Andrew Scott's theory of the rise and fall of international management regimes and David
      Apter's theory of how ideologies can develop when opportunities for creating a collective political identity
      exist among those who have been excluded in any political system. The NIEO ideology was created and has
      operational meaning only within the political system of intergovernmental management of the world economy first
      created after the second world war. The ideology contributes to the identity of a political actor, the third
      world, which, even though it acts only within a limited arena, is likely to be with us as long as the present
      system of intergovernmental management of the world economy exists. The positions of Asian, African, and Latin
      American elite advocates of the NIEO ideology, both within their national societies and within world society as a
      whole, should be understood as contributing to the rise of the ideology only in one sense. By adopting the NIEO
      ideology, third world political and economic leaders can partially resolve some of the contradictory beliefs they
      hold as a result of their contradictory position as both victimizers within their own societies and victims
      within world society.

        and Duties of States as international legislation enacted in 1974. It applies the duty of restitution to those
        states continuing "colonialism" after the charter was adopted. Beginning in 1977 the group has
        charged Israel and South Africa with duties of restitution under this principle, as reported in Ervin Laszlo et
        al., <span>The Objectives of the New International Economic Order</span> (New York: Pergamon,
        1978 ), pp. 169-70. The previous year the nonaligned countries reiterated their support of this circumscribed
        version of the restitution ethic:
      </p>
<p>
        The international community is urged to facilitate the effective exercise of the right of restitution and full
        compensation for damages for the exploitation and depletion and all damages to the natural and other resources
        of all states, territories, and peoples subjected to foreign aggression and occupation, alien and colonial
        domination, social discrimination, and apartheid. Then, emphasizing that the overarching duty under the NIEO
        was to be the permanent duty of all states to each other, not the historical duty of the exploiter to the
        exploited, the nonaligned states added:
      </p>
<p>
        It is, in addition, the duty of all states to extend assistance to these countries, territories, and peoples.

        typical northern criticism of the NIEO ideology in the late seventies. The fact that the new order program will
        not work means that more emphasis must be placed on the ". . . growth and equity performances of the
        domestic economies of the developing countries." The evidence suggests to him that the developing

        lack of development in domestic policies, and adopt basic needs criteria as their central goal. Once

        major development problems common throughout the third world assures that Cline's evidence will convince
        NIEO supporters of this alternative to the conclusion he hopes they will reach.

<h1 id="ht0050"><a id="page_181"></a><a href="#bck_ht0050">Afterword: How
    Ideas Can Help Resolve the North-South Conflict</a></h1>
<p>
      Any historical study leads to conclusions that can be documented and to others that cannot. This afterword
      contains my more speculative conclusions about the new order ideology. They cannot be supported by a weight of
      evidence because they do not concern what the ideology has been; they concern what it might become. I believe the
      NIEO ideology might someday contribute knowledge needed to resolve the current north-south conflict.
    </p>
<p>
      In abstract terms, the conflict will be resolved when the Bretton Woods system or its successor learns to deal
      with the south's economic problems as well as it deals with the north's. If we can say that the the new
      order ideology performs functions of "consciousness" for the third world, we can similarly say that
      those who act for the Bretton Woods system share a consciousness, of which the dominant ideology is part. What
      Deutsch's framework would have us call the "consciousness" of that system just equals what other
      scholars would call the "complex regime" containing the Bretton Woods institutions. In that regime the
      dominant ideology provides rules and guides for behavior and the Bretton Woods institutions help keep the regime
      open to new information. Understood in that way, as Ernst Haas illustrates, a regime is the locus of a capacity
      to learn how to manage fundamentally new problems even while it remains the consciousness consulted by those who
      manage a particular global issue.(<a href="#fn0403" id="bck_fn0403">l</a>) I believe, then,
      that the new order ideology and the experience of its southern advocates can help the postwar management system
      learn to deal effectively with the south's problems. That would transform the postwar institutions and
      require transformation of the dominant ideology.
    </p>
<p>
      Two equally speculative arguments suggest the new order ideology's capacity to contribute knowledge needed to
      manage global economic problems more effectively. One highlights the dilemmas third world advocates often face as
      a result of their contradictory positions in world society and within their home countries. According to one of
      the doyens of the policy sciences, Duncan MacRae, <a id="page_182"></a>people in such contradictory roles are
      likely to produce positive social innovations.(<a href="#fn0404" id="bck_fn0404">2</a>) The
      NIEO ideology's third world advocates live at the intersection between the cultures of the world's
      wealthy and the cultures of its most impoverished. They try consciously to resolve the contradictions between the
      two. More than any other group, they are likely to develop ways to resolve those contradictions.
    </p>
<p>
      In an entirely different way, the simple fact that NIEO advocates have been opposing the current system for
      almost forty years may have given them some of the knowledge the system itself needs. Immanuel Wallerstein, who
      began his career by looking for the commonalities among all the different successful nationalist movements in
      Africa, claims that the weaker party in any protracted struggle will know more about their relationship to the
      stronger than the stronger party will.(<a href="#fn0405" id="bck_fn0405">3</a>) The NIEO's
      advocates may know some things about the world economy that adherents to the dominant ideology have never
      learned.
    </p>
<p>
      Whatever wisdom about the world economy the third world may have acquired in its forty year conflict with the
      north, however, will not influence actual intergovernmental economic management until north and south agree upon
      their common interests. The current focus of the north-south conflict over the role of existing specialized
      agencies within the process of global negotiations may help. If both sides treat this disagreement as a
      substantive debate, and therefore try to convince the other side rather than to get it to make concessions, the
      result could be agreement on a formula defining the common north-south interests that both sides want
      international institutions to serve.
    </p>
<p>
      Luckily, neither north nor south has anything to lose in this debate. They cannot even lose face by being
      convinced of the other's position. The north need not be worried about being convinced of the south's
      position because the south's position on the proper role of intergovernmental economic management
      institutions remains one of the few incoherent parts of the new order ideology. The south need not worry about
      being convinced by the north; the north's current position on the subject makes no more sense.
    </p>
<p>
      The dominant ideology holds that intergovernmental economic management institutions exist only to do things that
      no state can do by itself. On this north and south agree. Neither fully accepts the lesson Keynes taught, that
      total subjection of international institutions to the will of one or many states would make such management
      impossible. Northerners just argue that international institutions must be subject to the interests of their
      dominant member states only, while the third world demands that international institutions be subject to the will
      of all states.
    </p>
<p>
<a id="page_183"></a>North and south will disagree over what common interest international institutions should
      have some autonomous responsibility to serve. Nonetheless, both northern and southern views will change if they
      debate the issue. Those views have to change, even if only to frame coherent opposing positions. That could get
      each side into a habit of changing its views in order to facilitate resolution of the conflict. If that were to
      happen, the last pages of the history of the south's new order ideology could be written about how it changed
      through time to resolve the north-south conflict, rather than to perpetuate it.
    </p>
<p>
      That has not happened yet. As I finish writing this afterword, in July 1983, north and south look as far apart as
      ever. UNCTAD VI has just ended after illustrating many of the themes in the last pages of this history of the
      NIEO ideology. The south came to UNCTAD VI with a set of proposals for "emergency" assistance to the
      third world, (<a href="#fn0406" id="bck_fn0406">4</a>) proposals influenced by the opinions of
      their northern supporters on the Brandt Commission whose second report argued the need for such a crisis program
      even if it meant postponing global agreement on more fundamental reforms.(<a href="#fn0407" id="bck_fn0407">5</a>) The northern states rejected even this seemingly moderate short-term proposal.
    </p>
<p>
      While southern delegates to UNCTAD VI may have thought that they had moderated their views by ending their calls
      for immediate creation of the NIEO and by adopting some of the views of their northern supporters, the major
      northern nations did not see it that way. The U.S. and its closest allies argued that the south's emergency
      program was too costly and that UNCTAD did not even have the authority to discuss it since the program involved
      much more than trade matters. Those northern governments still on the far side of ul Haq's philosophical
      bridge that I discuss in <a href="#ht0029">chapter 4</a> even denied the south's analysis
      of the current situation in the world economy. The most conservative northern states contended that while the
      economic health of the LDCs depended on that of the developed nations, the opposite was not at all true; the
      south's economic well-being was peripheral to that of the north.
    </p>
<p>
      The north's position at UNCTAD VI will not be its final word. Significantly, the day after the UNCTAD
      meetings ended two of the most important economic policy makers in the U.S. contradicted the analysis their
      government had been loudly defending for a month. The head of the American Council of Economic Advisors to the
      President and the Chairman of the Federal Reserve both argued that the economic health of some third world
      states, those with large debts, was indeed crucial to all developed countries.(<a href="#fn0408" id="bck_fn0408">6</a>) That change in tune hardly means that the U.S. has accepted the significance of every
      third world country's economy or that the U.S. would be willing to conduct any substantive negotiations with
      the <a id="page_184"></a>south in forums like UNCTAD, but the new U.S. argument was, in fact, the same one the
      Brandt Commission's second report had made. That position, in turn, provides a basis for substantive
      north-south discussions of common interests.
    </p>
<p>
      The south's UNCTAD VI position will not be its final word either, although I would not want to predict what
      lessons the south will draw from that meeting. Third world governments may decide that their recent strategy of
      showing more consideration for northern interests has been failure. The south may come to berate the Brandt
      Commission and other nongovernmental allies for suggesting common north-south interests that the most powerful
      northern governments failed to see. The south may move from its strategy of negotiation and from its growing
      interest in substantive debate with the north.
    </p>
<p>
      If the south does move away from its recent strategy the, NIEO ideology probably will contribute nothing to the
      resolution of the north-south conflict for some time. Now, the conflict can be resolved only through substantive
      debate. Given the difference in economic power between north and south, each round of simple bargaining based on
      exchanged concessions merely replicates the existing divisions between rich and poor and the conflict inherent in
      them. The path away from substantive debate will lead to a longer history for the NIEO ideology as third world
      governments transform their views in order to deal with their continuing conflict with the north.
