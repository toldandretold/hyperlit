            "h2": "1: Income polarisation in the neoliberal period It is common for contemporary Marxist writers to argue that the neoliberal period increased the income and wealth gap – or the polarisation of income and wealth – between rich and poor people, or between the working class and capitalist class. It is less common to acknowledge the growing polarisation between the small group of imperialist societies and the much larger group of Third World societies.<sup id=\"fnref2:1\"><a href=\"#fn:1\" class=\"footnote-ref\">1</a></sup> Many First World Marxists argue that the terms ‘First World’ and ‘Third World’ are meaningless, dated terms that do not correspond to today’s reality.<sup id=\"fnref2:2\"><a href=\"#fn:2\" class=\"footnote-ref\">2</a></sup> That the imperialist societies are almost the same group of countries, occupying almost the same position as a hundred years ago, is something rarely noted and even less analysed. Yet such international polarisation has not only persisted since the Second World War but has grown substantially – especially during the neoliberal period. The international polarisation represents, alongside the polarisation of income and wealth between classes, a crucial form of the general trend towards the concentration and centralisation of capital that Marx anticipated.<sup id=\"fnref2:3\"><a href=\"#fn:3\" class=\"footnote-ref\">3</a></sup> It is also an important concrete form taken by the growing inequality between classes. As such, no accurate analysis of the international class struggle is possible today without taking the worldwide division and polarisation between societies into account. At the second congress of the Communist International (Comintern) in 1920, Lenin emphasised the division of the world into a small minority of oppressor nations and ‘the vast majority’ of the world’s population who lived in the oppressed societies. He estimated that ‘about 70 percent of the world’s population belongs to the oppressed nations’.<sup id=\"fnref2:4\"><a href=\"#fn:4\" class=\"footnote-ref\">4</a></sup> Since then polarisation has dramatically increased. By 2015 not 70 per cent but 85 per cent of the world’s population lived in poor countries. The relative size of the rich country population – 13.4 per cent of the world’s people – has halved compared with Lenin’s estimate. Strikingly, today truly ‘middle-income’ or ‘Second World’ countries are almost non-existent, accounting for just 1.6 per cent of world population. The world’s states are clearly divided into top and bottom parts, with a large, almost unpopulated gap in between (Table 1.1). <a href=\"\" id=\"p14\"></a>",

The latter turns on the issue of super-exploitation of Third World labour. But super-exploitation alone cannot explain unequal exchange. Quoting Higginbottom, Smith proposes that ‘the idea of super-exploitation needs to be conceptually generalised at the necessary level of abstraction and incorporated into the theory of imperialism. Super-exploitation is … the hidden common essence defining imperialism.’<sup id=\"fnref2:44\"><a href=\"#fn:44\" class=\"footnote-ref\">44</a></sup> It is true that super-exploitation of cheap Third World labour is central to imperialism. The problem, however, is explaining exactly how MNCs and imperialist states make sure they are the primary beneficiaries.

This changed at the dawn of the imperialist period: ‘about 1880 … the appearance of monopolies … caused the economic system to resist the downward movement of prices … after 1880–90 we find a steady rise in prices, and a faster rise in incomes \\[in the core capitalist countries\\]’.<sup id=\"fnref13:2\"><a href=\"#fn:2\" class=\"footnote-ref\">2</a></sup> However, it was not ‘the economic system’ that resisted downward movement of prices.

Third World capital can sometimes win in competition with imperialist capital for the production of such commodities because, to the extent any given labour processes can be achieved by ordinary labour, which is cheap and abundant in the Third World, the price of that Third World labour tends to determine the world market price of the commodities thus produced. This means that capitalists paying a high price for labour that is doing the same thing is overpaying – according to the market. The market price of the expended labour contained in the simple commodity oscillates around the average cost of the reproduction of that type of labour power. Assume that standard car mirrors can be produced at an average level of efficiency by many reasonably competent firms across all the most developed Third World states. In that case, a standard mirror maker raising prices above that needed to get an average rate of non-monopoly profit, all else being equal, will lose market share to its competitors. This scenario applies to low-end undifferentiated producers in general. If, by contrast, a car’s high-end transmission system or automatic driving system requires specialist skills and equipment to produce, then firms involved in the latter can raise prices for their inputs to levels sufficient to obtain a monopoly profit. For this reason, that firm will command a greater portion of the total money obtained with the car’s final sale than the portion their labour hours contributed to the car’s production. Inability to raise prices much for standard commodities is why, no matter which technologies non-monopoly capitals are able to reverse engineer or otherwise imitate, these cannot be the basis for a sustained surplus profit if the new production process developed (and this is what must happen) is adapted to non-monopoly production conditions. When a process is simplified in a manner that makes it possible for one non-monopoly to achieve it, by definition it becomes relatively simple for other capitals with a similar level of development also to achieve it.",

            "h4": "Forty sectors with overwhelming imperialist dominance By ‘overwhelming’ it is meant that there is some Third World presence but of only minor importance. For example, in ‘airlines’ there are twenty-four companies, and eighteen are domiciled in imperialist states, including the top six. Each of the top six made close to, or more than, the profit of all six Third World airlines combined. The top company – Delta Air, from the United States – made close to twice the profit of the six Third World companies. In ‘apparel and footwear’, there are thirteen companies; only one is not from an imperialist state – Shenzhou International, from China. Shenzhou’s profit was around one-ninth of Nike’s. Considering China is by far the world’s largest exporter of footwear and clothing, this particular result is significant. In ‘auto and truck manufacturers’, there are thirty-one companies, eleven of them from the Third World. However, the top nine companies and fifteen of the top seventeen are all from imperialist states. China’s eight companies had a combined profit less than Toyota’s. The above examples of airlines, apparel and footwear and auto and truck manufacturers are hardly trivial. Yet this is only a selection of those starting with the letter ‘a’. There are another forty examples of sectors beginning with the other letters.<sup id=\"fnref10:21\"><a href=\"#fn:21\" class=\"footnote-ref\">21</a></sup> #### Ten sectors of imperialist dominance but significant Third World presence If we look at the ten sectors of imperialist dominance that also have a significant Third World presence, most Third world companies are primarily domestic in their operations. These are largely: ‘electric utilities’, ‘telecommunications services’, ‘real estate’, ‘diversified insurance’ and ‘other transportation’ – the latter being mostly airports and seaports. In electric utilities, the top five companies and nine of the top ten are all imperialist, though almost one-third of the eighty-eight companies in total are Third World, including ten from China. In telecommunications services, nine of the top ten companies are imperialist; however, the biggest company is Chinese state-owned China Mobile, listed in Hong Kong. The top five Third World companies’ profit was $25.2 billion, while that of the top imperialist companies was $46.9 billion. <a href=\"\" id=\"p180\"></a> Perhaps the most important trend is that ‘diversified mining and metals’, ‘specialised chemicals’, ‘oil and gas operations’ and ‘oil services and equipment’ all have significant Third World presence and also relatively similar levels of profitability between First World and Third World firms. In diversified mining and metals, for example, fifteen of thirty-eight firms are from the Third World. While the twenty-four First World firms were more profitable, the difference was only marginal. Similarly, in specialised chemicals, there were twenty-four First World companies to ten Third World. The profits of the top five of these First World companies were $8.5 billion, compared to $5.4 billion for the top five Third World companies. There is a similar statistical trend in both oil and gas operations and oil services and equipment. However, in both cases, the figures for Third World refer almost exclusively to profitable Russian companies. As such, it is difficult to view this as a rise of Third World profitability in a similar sense to the ex-colonial countries. <div>\\#### Five sectors of no dominance In the smaller undiversified metals sector, Third World presence goes even further. In ‘iron and steel’, there is almost the same number of imperialist as Third World companies, yet Third World-based companies make up six of the top ten companies, including the top two. The top five Third World firms made $13.6 billion in profits, while the top five First World firms made only $6.8 billion. In ‘aluminium’, five of the nine companies are Third World based. The only firm to make a profit over $1 billion was the Russian firm, Rusal, indicating just how low profit this sector was in 2017.The more profitable sectors of ‘no dominance’, in contrast to the raw materials sectors above, are characterised by domestic monopoly. In ‘major banks’, for example, giant Chinese banks with the highest profits are all domestic. None of these are international banks that compete with the US and European banks in global operations. Similarly, ‘construction services’ and ‘diversified utilities’ are characterised, principally, by domestic monopoly. ‘Diversified utilities’ is in fact a small sub-branch of ‘utilities’. With only twelve companies, it is tiny compared to the imperialist-dominated ‘electrical utilities’, which has 116 companies listed. Construction services is certainly a big sector, especially in China. However, what the large number of Chinese corporations in this sector reveals is largely the huge domestic construction activity in that country.</div> #### Three sectors of Third World dominance Easily the most profitable sector of Third World dominance is ‘regional banks’, which we discover are bigger and more numerous (133 versus 123) in the Third World than in the imperialist states. No doubt this is <a href=\"\" id=\"p181\"></a>partly because the Third World, with 85 per cent of world population, has many regions. This is certainly a big and lucrative sector. The top five banks (Chinese, Brazilian and Russian) made a combined profit of $56.3 billion. Yet, again, this does not indicate a competitive victory against imperialist capital but a domestic monopolistic position. Another of the sectors – ‘educational and training services’ – is not really a sector at all. The sole company listed is Kroton Educacional from Brazil, with a profit of only half a billion dollars. While Kroton’s lonely ‘success’ may represent a high degree of domestic monopoly, it seems clear this is a statistical anomaly reflecting that large US and other imperialist universities are not publicly traded and hence not listed. This leaves just one category of true Third World dominance where there is international competition – ‘household appliances’. There are just six firms in the sector. The three Third World firms (all Chinese) made double the profit of the three imperialist firms. However, the total profit for the entire sector was just $7.3 billion – that is, less than half the profits of, for example, Johnson and Johnson or Gilead Sciences (Table 11.3). Capitalist expansion in the neoliberal period resulted in few Third World companies rising to the apex of the global economy. If it were justified to count Russia separately, owing to its exceptional history and development, the numbers are even starker. The small number of exceptional sectors in which Third World competition has either displaced imperialist dominance or threatened to do so are either small, relatively unprofitable sectors or are made so by the presence of Third World capital. That is, by breaking imperialist monopoly in these sectors, Third World capital also breaks monopoly as such, including for itself. This pattern conforms entirely to the thesis presented in this chapter that what has developed in the Third World is non-monopolistic capitalism. Nothing is new in this. Just as clothing manufacture long ceased to be the domain of the imperialist world, we should not be surprised if low-end steel and aluminium production, or the mass production of domestic washing machines, refrigerators, air-conditioners or basic automobile assembly are in the future transferred more fully to the Third World (assuming these are not further mechanised). It is hardly conceivable that this not be the case for certain lines of production. If low-end steel and aluminium is further mechanised, preventing Third World dominance of that sector, then Third World dominance could be expected in a different sector – conceivably in bulk production of automobiles. The Third World’s ‘dominance’ of clothing manufacture has evidently not led to the rise of Third World clothing monopolies. As noted, the sector footwear and apparel is most thoroughly dominated by imperialist capital.<sup id=\"fnref10:22\"><a href=\"#fn:22\" class=\"footnote-ref\">22</a></sup> Similarly, to the extent household appliances, aluminium or other sectors <a href=\"\" id=\"p182\"></a> #### Table 11.3: Eighty-three economic sectors: imperialist and Third World dominance  <table><thead><tr><th>**No Third World corporations listed at all**</th><th>24 sectors</th><th>Advertising, air courier, business products and supplies, computer and electronics retail, computer storage devices, containers and packaging, diversified media, discount stores, environmental and waste, forest products, furniture and fixtures, health care services, home improvement retail, insurance brokers, managed health care, medical equipment supplies, paper and paper products, precision health care equipment, printing and publishing, restaurants, security systems, semiconductors, thrifts and mortgage finance and trucking</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>**Overwhelming imperialist dominance with only minor Third World presence**</td><td>40 sectors</td><td>Aerospace or defence, airlines, apparel and footwear, auto and truck manufacturers, auto and truck parts, beverages, biotech, broadcasting and cable, casinos and gambling, communications equipment, computer hardware, computer services, conglomerates, construction materials, business and personal services, consumer electronics, department stores, diversified chemicals, drug retail, electrical equipment, electronics, food processing, food retail, hotels and motels, household/personal care, internet and catalogue retail, natural gas utilities, other industrial equipment, pharmaceuticals, railroads, recreational products, rental and leasing, software and programming, speciality stores, tobacco, trading companies, consumer financial services, investment services, property and casualty insurance, life and health insurance</td></tr><tr><td>**Imperialist dominance with significant Third World presence**</td><td>10 sectors</td><td>Electric utilities, telecommunications services, real estate, diversified mining and metals, specialised chemicals, heavy equipment, oil and gas operations, oil services and equipment, other transportation, diversified insurance</td></tr><tr><td>**No dominance**</td><td>5 sectors</td><td>Construction services, diversified utilities, iron and steel, aluminium, major banks</td></tr><tr><td>**Third World dominance**</td><td>3 sectors</td><td>Educational and training services, household appliances, regional banks</td></tr></tbody></table>",

However, the spread of monopoly competition to all spheres of social life fundamentally changes the definition and meaning of industrialisation in the modern world. During the neoliberal period, China and other Third World states rapidly expanded the local presence of certain industries and aspects of industries that had historically been central to imperialist monopoly – such as coal, steel and autos. Third World industry is nothing new. However, China’s emergence as the largest producer of each of those industries and many others represented a much larger scale of the phenomenon than previously. China’s quantitative superiority in many industries was itself seen to represent its qualitative or overall industrial superiority, or rapid development towards that.",

Boron argues that ‘virtually all of the world’s largest corporations have experienced decisive support from government policies and trade barriers to make them viable’.<sup id=\"fnref15:1\"><a href=\"#fn:1\" class=\"footnote-ref\">1</a></sup> However, much contemporary writing tends to overlook state support given in the production process itself, instead emphasising fiscal and financial support,<sup id=\"fnref16:2\"><a href=\"#fn:2\" class=\"footnote-ref\">2</a></sup> state repression and military, legal and regulatory functions. For example, Gowan points out that the huge scale of modern advanced plants requires such a scale of cheap credit that states must be ‘deeply implicated in creating the conditions for the supply of such credit’.<sup id=\"fnref15:3\"><a href=\"#fn:3\" class=\"footnote-ref\">3</a></sup> Where Marxist work mentions state involvement in the creation of conditions of production, this often refers to the most elementary conditions such as construction of public roads and other communications infrastructure, as well as state organisation of the reproduction of labour power in general, such as universal schooling or provision of higher education in general.<sup id=\"fnref15:4\"><a href=\"#fn:4\" class=\"footnote-ref\">4</a></sup>",

            "h3": "The Third World state Third World state support is also crucial for the largest Third World capitalist firms, and this is particularly so in the most developed Third World countries, which possess a larger magnitude and complexity of capital relative to less advanced regions. The role demanded of Third World states, in order to assist their capitalist groups to function, even as non-monopolistic firms, is no less crucial. Chinese or Brazilian capital could not function at the level it does without state support. Yet there is a difference in quality between Third World and imperialist capital. Hence also there is a qualitative difference between the type and degree of state support required by each to function. As Chibber points out, the state role in pre-imperialist late development was relatively simple, but by the twentieth century, states needed to control private investment and make direct state investment.<sup id=\"fnref14:15\"><a href=\"#fn:15\" class=\"footnote-ref\">15</a></sup> Schwartz notes that ‘even Ricardian comparative advantage development strategy requires state mobilisation of capital for social overhead capital (such as the provision of the transportation networks needed to get products to the market)’.<sup id=\"fnref14:16\"><a href=\"#fn:16\" class=\"footnote-ref\">16</a></sup> However, the competitive requirements for the reproduction of monopoly capital are qualitatively different. These can hardly be met by a relatively weak, under-resourced state, as predominantly exists in the Third World. The capacity of imperialist states in relation to Third World states stands as monopoly private capital does in relation to non-monopolies. Not only are imperialist states blessed with the substantial resource advantages owing to their own incumbency as the beneficiaries of prior accumulation, they are also continuously energised by fresh flows of large revenues owing to their association with the largest and most profitable companies in the world. The ideal Third World state, from the point of view of imperialist monopoly, aims not to organise and subsidise the development of new competitors – but to actively facilitate the penetration of FDI and to promote complementary forms of economic development within its territory (i.e. that which uses its competitive advantages, principally cheap labour). This is what is meant by the aid and multilateral agencies’ and imperialist ideologues’ promotion of institutional ‘capacity building’ for Third World development.",

They will thereby lose their monopolistic character. Reproduction of dominance by any given section of capital therefore requires it to be involved with constant innovation of new technology. In monopoly conditions, as Lenin highlighted, this occurs through the systematic organisation of R &amp; D (i.e. application of science to discovery and refinement of new labour technique). What we can add today – and this was added by Mandel in 1972 – is that the complexity and scale of the production process has reached such a high degree that meeting its needs and developing it further requires such a scale of resources that it can only be advanced under the leadership of one institution: the highest and most powerful institution of capitalist imperialism, the imperialist state. Hence the state’s role in scientific R &amp; D has become key to ensuring the competitiveness, or dominance, of the capitalist groups associated with it against competing blocks of capital. Surveying the effects of the post-war shift to semi-automated production (the ‘third technological revolution’), Mandel observed an increasing ‘compulsion to accelerate technological innovation’ coupled with ‘a steep increase in the cost of “research and development” … \\[and\\] a shorter lifespan of fixed capital, especially machines’.<sup id=\"fnref16:1\"><a href=\"#fn:1\" class=\"footnote-ref\">1</a></sup> Following Lenin, Mandel’s work highlights the growing number and importance of industrial research laboratories.<sup id=\"fnref17:2\"><a href=\"#fn:2\" class=\"footnote-ref\">2</a></sup> He says that, overall, ‘the continuous and systematic hunt for technological innovations and the corresponding surplus-profits becomes the standard hallmark of late capitalist enterprises and especially the late capitalist large corporations’.<sup id=\"fnref16:3\"><a href=\"#fn:3\" class=\"footnote-ref\">3</a></sup>",

            "h3": "Why the long boom? Before examining the imperialist attacks on China and China’s most recent attempts to upgrade parts of its labour process, it is first necessary to outline how Chinese capitalism, despite its technological subordination, was still able to expand so rapidly in the neoliberal period. It is suggested China was neither able nor aiming to break the monopolistic position of the imperialist states. Rather, the easiest route to accumulation has been to offer up Chinese labour to international capital. Chinese capital could hardly be expected to choose a path of confrontation with the most powerful monopolies when it could more certainly enrich itself through a division of labour with them, even if the exact contours and terms of this division are now contested. The size and rapid growth of China’s labour force are undoubtedly the principal underlying factors in its success. Non-monopoly production is essentially the organisation of ordinary labour power. Therefore, China might be expected to be the most successful non-monopoly state, as its labour is most abundant and, until recently, was among the cheapest. Between 1991 and 2006 China’s urban workforce increased by 260 million.<sup id=\"fnref6:42\"><a href=\"#fn:42\" class=\"footnote-ref\">42</a></sup> However, labour power, in modern production, must also be well organised. India’s population is almost as large as China’s. It is younger, growing quickly, has lower wages and will soon surpass China in absolute population size. Yet there is nil possibility – in the near term – of India surpassing China’s position as a top, large Third World state, or of even approaching that position. India is far less developed, as revealed by its per capita income, which is around one-fifth of China’s. On the other hand, China has caught up to the major top-tier Third World economies, as shown. It is necessary therefore to explain not only China’s inability to compete with imperialism in highest labour processes, but also its ability to move towards the top of the Third World. Gowan sensed China’s unique attributes when he argued that ‘insofar as China retains a state organized for development it possesses unique potentials to exploit extraordinary scale economies and learning economies and to acquire great state resources for upgrading its production to rise up the international division of labour’.<sup id=\"fnref6:43\"><a href=\"#fn:43\" class=\"footnote-ref\">43</a></sup>",

However, imperialism has historically driven extremely hard bargains against even the weakest Third World societies using the most belligerent and violent means. Iraq and Afghanistan never threatened US imperialism even if many reports and much analysis told us they did. The mere presence of conflict tells us nothing about the balance of forces. Workers after all sometimes engage in bitter fights with their bosses both offensively and in defence.
