Agree. good to quote. As King has shown, Lenin's \*Imperialism\*, understood as the stage of capital dominated by monopoly finance capital, is a 'usable framework'. In this article, I extend this work of King by showing that, it is quite impossible to understand global knowledge production without it.

> "In this labour conception of imperialism, the role of the imperialist state is also extended beyond those roles for which it is commonly noted: developing and enforcing laws, supressing workers, going to war or giving financial assistance to capital. In addition to these, the imperialist state is intimately involved in raising labour productivity. Capitalist firms are little able to independently carry out the broad social policies required to create highest labour productivity and find themselves fundamentally dependent for this on the imperialist state."

Labour process monopoly is the most essential - or core - monopoly.

> "In the conditions of capitalist imperialism, Third World societies developing new technologies – even where this is possible – is not sufficient on its own. To challenge imperialist dominance would require developing new technologies for the production of commodities sold on the capitalist world market. Therefore, it requires developing new technologies that can defeat the belligerent competition of incumbent technological leaders on <a id="8">the market – something entirely different to the incremental learning and improvement envisaged by multilateral development institutions such as the World Bank."

Question: How? Can it be surpassed sector by sector? Or will struggle in one sector trigger a global crackdown? Most likely the latter, unless the sector is unimportant to profits (wikipedia). That's where the NIEO is needed, a world order initiated by non-monopoly capitalist states, will allow for a more "orderly" transition from one hegemony to the next. It could help reduce the power of monopoly capitalist elites to quash resistance against monopoly capital in a particular sector in a non-monopoly capital state. For example, by legitimising state sovereignty of national resources, and the rejection of intellectual property rights.

A key point King makes. Its more than IP regimes. Even without IP regimes, US would still have monopoly of labour process.



---

> "Genuine social progress to the degree needed cannot occur outside of and in opposition to the principal centres of scientific knowledge (the imperialist states) without involving mobilisation of the broad masses of the population. Yet that can hardly happen if the main purpose of development is merely to enrich local capitalist classes – and this remains the goal in countries dominated by non-monopoly capital. Moreover, not even the most revolutionary Third World society could conceivably surpass the technical and scientific level of modern imperialist states when operating under the blows of imperialist hostility and sabotage."
> [↩](http://localhost:8000/king2021imperialism#user-name_1733184804327)


True. So resistance must come from within the sectors of scientific knowledge, as well as from without. This relation was key to Nkrumah.



---

> "What is decisive is that Third World capitalism is prevented even from taking incremental steps that would eventually make possible a challenge to imperialism. This is because as capitalist societies they participate in production of commodities for the capitalist world market. Moreover, they are compelled to do so in accordance with an existing division of labour complete with its established technological and social polarisation. There is no entry point to this system, other than at the bottom."
> [↩](http://localhost:8000/king2021imperialism#user-name_1733184860237)


But, this imperialist system can be reformed. Just as there are "many capitals" and "many capitalist forms of state", there are different possible imperialisms. In some, economic development in the periphery, non-monopoly sectors, is relatively more easy.

> "Opponents of this book will contend that its arguments are too determinist, that they amount to concluding history has ended, that no further historical or social development is possible under capitalism.
