China does not threaten the global dominance of the rich countries and it cannot while under the global capitalist system \u2013 far from it. Indeed, <mark class=\"user-name_1733183111724\" id=\"user-name_1733183111724\">China remains a poor country \u2013 with low per capita income and wealth \u2013 and is being held in that position by the scientific and productive monopolies of the rich countries<\/mark>. This is the essence of the imperialist stranglehold on China. The same stranglehold grips not only China but almost every country in Asia, Africa and South America. The whole of what used to be called the \u2018Third World\u2019 \u2013 a term we are told is no longer relevant \u2013 is still poor and exploited. Despite carrying out a growing part of the world\u2019s work, the poor countries are not breaking free of imperialist domination. Nor do any of them, including China, threaten to topple, replace, outcompete or overtake the imperialist states. This book explains how the rich, imperialist countries are able to maintain their dominance decade after decade and why this situation will continue as long as the present system remains in place. For years, to make such statements has invited not only ridicule but incomprehension. China\u2019s supposed threat to the imperialist countries appears so obvious to almost everyone. Most discussion is not about if China can catch up, but how long it might take, or what it will look like. This view is held by the huge majority of working people, scholars and intellectuals, including many on the Left. Callinicos expressed the dominant view when he said, \u2018One has only to utter the word \u201cChina\u201d to indicate what\u2019s wrong with the Third Worldist understanding of imperialism\u2019.1 What he suggests is that China debunks <mark class=\"user-name_1733183167329\" id=\"user-name_1733183167329\">the idea the<\/mark> world is divided into rich, imperialist and poor, exploited countries; that we should abandon such views, which are symbolised by the term \u2018Third World\u2019. Until recently, another popular talking point \u2013 the rise of the \u2018BRICS\u2019 countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) \u2013 was also supposed to debunk the \u2018Third Worldist\u2019 view that the world is divided between rich and poor countries. Yet this has already fallen out of fashion. The imagined rise of BRICS is now obviously false as all the others, besides China, are widely acknowledged as facing deep economic crises. But no rethink of what caused so many unrealistic expectations about their development is taking place. Without a rethink, it is hard to see how the outlook will change. The same thinking is still being applied to China. Today a small core of rich countries \u2013 largely the same states as a hundred years ago \u2013 still dominate the international economy, securing the lion\u2019s share of total world income. It is easy to identify them because they are many, many times richer than all the other major societies. They are home to just 13 per cent of the world\u2019s people. These are the imperialist countries. Like a hundred years ago, the imperialist countries are principally Western Europe, North America and Japan \u2013 plus Australia and New Zealand. We can now add Israel, South Korea and Taiwan. The world has become ever more polarised \u2013 especially since the collapse of the Soviet Union. The polarisation is between this small group of imperialist countries and the vast majority of countries that make up the \u2018Third World\u2019. Today there is almost no middle ground or \u2018Second World\u2019 between the rich and poor states. China is exemplary of this pattern. China remains a poor country with per capita income less than 20 per cent of the imperialist states (see Chapter 1). This book shows that is where it and other countries will remain, so long as the world remains capitalist. Readers who are old enough may find parts of the contemporary China hype sounds familiar. In the 1960s \u2013 long before anyone started talking about BRICS \u2013 it was claimed that Brazil was approaching something then called economic \u2018take-off\u2019, which would launch it into the orbit of the developed, imperialist states.2 These expectations were disappointed. Brazil today languishes in the same position within the world hierarchy as it did six decades ago. It is still a relatively well-developed Third World state, richer than the worst off, but vastly poorer than the imperialist societies. Brazil\u2019s per capita income remains essentially unchanged relative to the imperialist world \u2013 just 19 per cent of the average imperialist country\u2019s per capita income. The hype around the threat of competition from this or that Third World country that is \u2018catching up\u2019 or poised to \u2018overtake\u2019 imperialist countries is part of the propaganda offensives of the capitalist classes within the imperialist societies. Capitalists cutting wages or replacing workers with machines in such countries find it convenient to point their finger at competition from alien states and peoples as the cause. The foreign threat is exaggerated to make attacks on workers appear necessary, inevitable and not the fault or responsibility of the capital that actually carries them out. Denigrating these countries as failed states inhabited by inferior or threatening peoples and regimes is a part of making this sales pitch easier. This book focuses on critiquing the economic hype associated with this propaganda. The real and imagined threat of Chinese economic competition has proven every bit as useful as the war on terror as a rallying cry for national chauvinism and racism in the post-Cold War world. It has greatly assisted US capitalists and capitalists in other rich countries to justify attacks on living conditions of working people in their own countries \u2013 necessary to safeguard capitalist profitability in the neoliberal period. The propaganda offensive against China is helped endlessly by the fact that large sections of the Left, including Marxists, have swallowed it whole. <mark class=\"user-name_1733183456245\" id=\"user-name_1733183456245\">For example, US socialists like Ashley Smith argue that China is \u2018a new imperial power\u2019<\/mark>.3 If China really was a threat to the world dominance of the United States and other imperialist societies, when US capitalists or their political representatives told workers they need to accept job losses and pay cuts due to overwhelming Chinese competition, this would have some basis. In reality it is marginal US producers that are seriously threatened by Chinese competition. <mark class=\"user-name_1733785918255\" id=\"user-name_1733785918255\">Other<\/mark> companies have taken advantage of cheap Chinese labour to reduce their costs and increase their profits. For them the China threat provided a perfect cover. We know large parts of the US working class have accepted these arguments and do view China as a threat, given their support for Trump\u2019s racist programme to \u2018Make America Great Again\u2019 or alternative America first programmes promoted by Biden, Sanders and others.

Robinson, *Global Capitalism and the Crisis of Humanity* (New York, Cambridge University Press. 2014), pp. 99\u2013112.## 4: The idea of China as a rising threat It is an undeniable fact that contemporary China has risen in many highly important senses. Its weight in world trade and the increased income and consumption are obvious examples. It is also a fact that the emergence of Chinese competition has bankrupted certain individual capitals in the First World and made certain lines of production unviable in the imperialist world or parts of it. Some weakest First World capitalists who could neither exploit the dynamic of offshoring and labour specialisation to their own advantage, nor transition to other production spheres, went bankrupt. It is this dying or redundant capital, and the destruction of sections of the working class tied to it \u2013 in some cases whole communities or regions \u2013 that form a solid social basis for the rising China discourse inside the imperialist countries. There are also sections of capital, or more often labour, that are bankrupt or redundant for reasons that have nothing or little to do with China, but \u2013 reflecting the dominant anti-China ideas \u2013 they view their decline as being caused by China\u2019s so-called rise. Capital that is being suffocated perhaps has a natural affinity for hyperbolic discourse against competitors. For weakest imperialist capital locked out of globalisation and bankrupted by it, the changes appear simply as a loss of production to overseas competition, especially to China. The history of racist nationalism in the imperialist working classes has made many workers receptive to such ideas. The rising China idea enjoys a broad following among every stratum within the imperialist societies. Pew Research Center\u2019s spring 2018 Global Attitudes Survey asked, \u2018How serious a problem is the loss of US jobs to China?\u2019 Some 83 per cent of the US-based respondents rated this as either somewhat serious (32 per cent) or very serious (51 per cent). Somewhat or very serious was also how 82 per cent of respondents rated the US bilateral trade deficit with China. Fully 89 per cent of respondents said the same about Chinese ownership of US debt. Some 88 per cent believe it is \u2018better if the US, not China, is the world\u2019s leading power\u2019.<sup id=\"fnref5:1\"><a href=\"#fn:1\" class=\"footnote-ref\">1<\/a><\/sup> The spread of capitalist commodity production in China and across much of the Third World roughly coincides with the period of neoliberalism internationally. Thus the period of \u2018offshoring\u2019 and its associated job losses <a href=\"\" id=\"p76\"><\/a>for workers in the imperialist economies coincides historically with other deprivations inflicted on working classes inside the rich countries in the neoliberal period. For this reason, some of the attacks on the living standards of First World working people carried out by their capitalist rulers can be falsely presented as an inevitable part of imperial decline and China\u2019s rise. Rising China discourse helps undermine labour confidence and organisation inside imperialist states. Capital\u2019s political representatives can plausibly deny responsibility for declining living conditions of affected communities. These are presented as necessary to ward off the threat to national or regional competitiveness. The phenomenon is not new. Marchlewski argued in 1904 that \u2018the \u201cdecline of British industry\u201d has become a slogan for the imperialist agitators to bait the masses. For England\u2019s working class, the decline of English industry would undoubtedly be a fearful danger, and that is why the slogan is very dangerous.\u2019<sup id=\"fnref5:2\"><a href=\"#fn:2\" class=\"footnote-ref\">2<\/a><\/sup> The same is true today, except that imperialism is not declining in relation to the Third World. Yet the political danger is clear. The response of many workers to capitalist austerity in the neoliberal period has been not to seek to replace capitalism, but to rally around the flag under right or left protectionist programmes such as those of Trump, Sanders or Johnson. The rising China discourse and the confidence it projects in the prospects of Third World capitalist development also lends implicit ideological support to Third World capitalist ruling classes and their political representatives such as Xi Jinping, Modi and Duterte, who present themselves as leaders of national revival against imperialist domination and national shame, or at least as the architects of social progress. As Starrs points out, \u2018it has become a staple of conventional wisdom that global economic power is shifting inexorably towards the East and the South\u2019.<sup id=\"fnref5:3\"><a href=\"#fn:3\" class=\"footnote-ref\">3<\/a><\/sup> Because the other supposed contenders have fallen away, attention now falls principally on one place \u2013 China.

The rising China idea enjoys a broad following among every stratum within the imperialist societies. Pew Research Center\u2019s spring 2018 Global Attitudes Survey asked, \u2018How serious a problem is the loss of US jobs to China?\u2019 Some 83 per cent of the US-based respondents rated this as either somewhat serious (32 per cent) or very serious (51 per cent). Somewhat or very serious was also how 82 per cent of respondents rated the US bilateral trade deficit with China. Fully 89 per cent of respondents said the same about Chinese ownership of US debt. Some 88 per cent believe it is \u2018better if the US, not China, is the world\u2019s leading power\u2019.<sup id=\"fnref5:1\"><a href=\"#fn:1\" class=\"footnote-ref\">1<\/a><\/sup> The spread of capitalist commodity production in China and across much of the Third World roughly coincides with the period of neoliberalism internationally. Thus the period of \u2018offshoring\u2019 and its associated job losses <a href=\"\" id=\"p76\"><\/a>for workers in the imperialist economies coincides historically with other deprivations inflicted on working classes inside the rich countries in the neoliberal period. For this reason, some of the attacks on the living standards of First World working people carried out by their capitalist rulers can be falsely presented as an inevitable part of imperial decline and China\u2019s rise. Rising China discourse helps undermine labour confidence and organisation inside imperialist states. Capital\u2019s political representatives can plausibly deny responsibility for declining living conditions of affected communities. These are presented as necessary to ward off the threat to national or regional competitiveness. The phenomenon is not new. Marchlewski argued in 1904 that \u2018the \u201cdecline of British industry\u201d has become a slogan for the imperialist agitators to bait the masses. For England\u2019s working class, the decline of English industry would undoubtedly be a fearful danger, and that is why the slogan is very dangerous.\u2019<sup id=\"fnref5:2\"><a href=\"#fn:2\" class=\"footnote-ref\">2<\/a><\/sup> The same is true today, except that imperialism is not declining in relation to the Third World. Yet the political danger is clear. The response of many workers to capitalist austerity in the neoliberal period has been not to seek to replace capitalism, but to rally around the flag under right or left protectionist programmes such as those of Trump, Sanders or Johnson. The rising China discourse and the confidence it projects in the prospects of Third World capitalist development also lends implicit ideological support to Third World capitalist ruling classes and their political representatives such as Xi Jinping, Modi and Duterte, who present themselves as leaders of national revival against imperialist domination and national shame, or at least as the architects of social progress. As Starrs points out, \u2018it has become a staple of conventional wisdom that global economic power is shifting inexorably towards the East and the South\u2019.<sup id=\"fnref5:3\"><a href=\"#fn:3\" class=\"footnote-ref\">3<\/a><\/sup> Because the other supposed contenders have fallen away, attention now falls principally on one place \u2013 China. The *New York Times*, for example, casually refers to \u2018the industrial might of an emerging superpower\u2019<sup id=\"fnref5:4\"><a href=\"#fn:4\" class=\"footnote-ref\">4<\/a><\/sup> \u2013 of course this is China \u2013 while the Hong Kong-based *South China Morning Post*, a little closer to the action, trips up on contradictory language, like arguing \u2018the nation seeks to catch up as a technology leader\u2019.<sup id=\"fnref5:5\"><a href=\"#fn:5\" class=\"footnote-ref\">5<\/a><\/sup> It is the overwhelming view, among mainstream commentators, that China is rising in a way that is somehow imperialist or ultimately will challenge the imperialist monopoly on wealth and power.<sup id=\"fnref4:6\"><a href=\"#fn:6\" class=\"footnote-ref\">6<\/a><\/sup> Most First World Marxist writing sees China as either \u2018a new imperial power\u2019, as Ashley Smith puts it, or developing in that direction.<sup id=\"fnref4:7\"><a href=\"#fn:7\" class=\"footnote-ref\">7<\/a><\/sup> As Panitch and Gindin pointed out,> Given the severity and duration of the latest crisis \\[i.e. 2008\u20139\\] in a global capitalist economy that the American state had been so central in constructing, it was hardly surprising to see a resurgence of pronouncements that US <a href=\"\" id=\"p77\"><\/a>hegemony was coming to an end \u2026 \\[because\\] pundits of every persuasion once again blur the lines between a capitalist crisis and a decline of US empire.<sup id=\"fnref4:8\"><a href=\"#fn:8\" class=\"footnote-ref\">8<\/a><\/sup>"

It will be shown that Lenin\u2019s \u2018monopoly finance capital\u2019 in fact sticks closely to the framework established by Marx in *Capital*. Thus, while theoretically formulating the arrival of a new capitalist epoch, Lenin\u2019s work is one of orthodox Marxism."

This is a striking illustration that competition occurs not only in the sphere of actual production. In other cases, the specialisation is only partial. Technologically advanced companies do not always outsource less advanced aspects of their production. These may be kept in-house to defend \u2018intellectual property\u2019 or for practical reasons like simplification of logistics and management, speed to market or control of overall operations.<sup id=\"fnref7:27\"><a href=\"#fn:27\" class=\"footnote-ref\">27<\/a><\/sup>Within low-end industries like clothing and textiles, the same technical polarisation of labour processes occurs. MNC-controlled clothing production today is usually outsourced to independent producers. However, MNCs monopolise development and production of new synthetics, dyes and production equipment together with fashion design. Cutting, sewing and other processes intense in low-end or ordinary labour are then outsourced, before finished items are returned to the MNCs, which handle logistics, marketing and sales and act as the overall \u2018systems integrator firm\u2019 (i.e. organiser of the overall process).<sup id=\"fnref7:28\"><a href=\"#fn:28\" class=\"footnote-ref\">28<\/a><\/sup>The important example of the automotive industry demonstrates how this polarisation works.

Most aspects of the production of autos today represent increasingly commonplace technology and therefore ordinary labour \u2013 at least in the production phase. High prices for vehicles are possible where firms add advanced electronic equipment, software and marketing. This is reflected in the often wide variety of sales prices for a single model, depending on what add-ons are included \u2013 a phenomenon that will likely increase as self-driving cars are rolled out commercially. The process of car production itself is also divided along technical lines. As Sturgeon et al. explain: \u2018The heavy engineering work of vehicle development, where conceptual designs are translated into the parts and sub- systems that can be assembled into a drivable vehicle, remain centralised in or near the design clusters that have arisen near the headquarters of lead firms.\u2019<sup id=\"fnref7:29\"><a href=\"#fn:29\" class=\"footnote-ref\">29<\/a><\/sup> All the important automotive design centres in the world are located in imperialist states.

                    "<div><a href=\"\" id=\"p152\"><\/a>The \u2018fine slicing\u2019 of industrial sectors caused a rapid growth in trade of intermediate goods and services (i.e. those not sold to the final consumer). In 2012 this reached around 60 per cent of global trade.<sup id=\"fnref7:24\"><\/sup><a href=\"#fn:24\" class=\"footnote-ref\">24<\/a> As such, it has become increasingly problematic to categorise entire industries or products as high, medium or low technology.<sup id=\"fnref8:25\"><a href=\"#fn:25\" class=\"footnote-ref\">25<\/a><\/sup> Virtually all industries and products require both highly sophisticated and simple labour processes. That computers, for example, are labelled \u2018made in China\u2019 hardly signifies China\u2019s achievement of high-technology production if each machine\u2019s most complex components were imported.<sup id=\"fnref7:26\"><a href=\"#fn:26\" class=\"footnote-ref\">26<\/a><\/sup>The extreme case of this labour division occurs where companies \u2013 such as Gap, Nike, Calvin Klein, Mattel, Apple, Dell, Toshiba, Cisco Systems and Xilinx \u2013 do not manufacture at all but outsource their production. This is a striking illustration that competition occurs not only in the sphere of actual production. In other cases, the specialisation is only partial. Technologically advanced companies do not always outsource less advanced aspects of their production. These may be kept in-house to defend \u2018intellectual property\u2019 or for practical reasons like simplification of logistics and management, speed to market or control of overall operations.<sup id=\"fnref7:27\"><a href=\"#fn:27\" class=\"footnote-ref\">27<\/a><\/sup>Within low-end industries like clothing and textiles, the same technical polarisation of labour processes occurs. MNC-controlled clothing production today is usually outsourced to independent producers. However, MNCs monopolise development and production of new synthetics, dyes and production equipment together with fashion design. Cutting, sewing and other processes intense in low-end or ordinary labour are then outsourced, before finished items are returned to the MNCs, which handle logistics, marketing and sales and act as the overall \u2018systems integrator firm\u2019 (i.e. organiser of the overall process).<sup id=\"fnref7:28\"><a href=\"#fn:28\" class=\"footnote-ref\">28<\/a><\/sup>The important example of the automotive industry demonstrates how this polarisation works. The leading global automakers are all still <a href=\"\" id=\"p153\"><\/a>imperialist-based MNCs. Most aspects of the production of autos today represent increasingly commonplace technology and therefore ordinary labour \u2013 at least in the production phase. High prices for vehicles are possible where firms add advanced electronic equipment, software and marketing. This is reflected in the often wide variety of sales prices for a single model, depending on what add-ons are included \u2013 a phenomenon that will likely increase as self-driving cars are rolled out commercially. The process of car production itself is also divided along technical lines. As Sturgeon et al. explain: \u2018The heavy engineering work of vehicle development, where conceptual designs are translated into the parts and sub- systems that can be assembled into a drivable vehicle, remain centralised in or near the design clusters that have arisen near the headquarters of lead firms.\u2019<sup id=\"fnref7:29\"><a href=\"#fn:29\" class=\"footnote-ref\">29<\/a><\/sup> All the important automotive design centres in the world are located in imperialist states. Detroit boasts General Motors (GM), Ford, Chrysler, Toyota and Nissan. Cologne in Germany is home to Ford Europe. Also in Germany, Wolfsburg hosts Volkswagen, and Stuttgart, Daimler-Benz. GM\u2019s European division is in Russelsheim.

                "content": "Forty sectors with overwhelming imperialist dominance By \u2018overwhelming\u2019 it is meant that there is some Third World presence but of only minor importance. For example, in \u2018airlines\u2019 there are twenty-four companies, and eighteen are domiciled in imperialist states, including the top six. Each of the top six made close to, or more than, the profit of all six Third World airlines combined. The top company \u2013 Delta Air, from the United States \u2013 made close to twice the profit of the six Third World companies. In \u2018apparel and footwear\u2019, there are thirteen companies; only one is not from an imperialist state \u2013 Shenzhou International, from China. Shenzhou\u2019s profit was around one-ninth of Nike\u2019s. Considering China is by far the world\u2019s largest exporter of footwear and clothing, this particular result is significant. In \u2018auto and truck manufacturers\u2019, there are thirty-one companies, eleven of them from the Third World. However, the top nine companies and fifteen of the top seventeen are all from imperialist states. China\u2019s eight companies had a combined profit less than Toyota\u2019s. The above examples of airlines, apparel and footwear and auto and truck manufacturers are hardly trivial. Yet this is only a selection of those starting with the letter \u2018a\u2019. There are another forty examples of sectors beginning with the other letters.<sup id=\"fnref10:21\"><a href=\"#fn:21\" class=\"footnote-ref\">21<\/a><\/sup> #### Ten sectors of imperialist dominance but significant Third World presence If we look at the ten sectors of imperialist dominance that also have a significant Third World presence, most Third world companies are primarily domestic in their operations. These are largely: \u2018electric utilities\u2019, \u2018telecommunications services\u2019, \u2018real estate\u2019, \u2018diversified insurance\u2019 and \u2018other transportation\u2019 \u2013 the latter being mostly airports and seaports. In electric utilities, the top five companies and nine of the top ten are all imperialist, though almost one-third of the eighty-eight companies in total are Third World, including ten from China. In telecommunications services, nine of the top ten companies are imperialist; however, the biggest company is Chinese state-owned China Mobile, listed in Hong Kong. The top five Third World companies\u2019 profit was $25.2 billion, while that of the top imperialist companies was $46.9 billion. <a href=\"\" id=\"p180\"><\/a> Perhaps the most important trend is that \u2018diversified mining and metals\u2019, \u2018specialised chemicals\u2019, \u2018oil and gas operations\u2019 and \u2018oil services and equipment\u2019 all have significant Third World presence and also relatively similar levels of profitability between First World and Third World firms. In diversified mining and metals, for example, fifteen of thirty-eight firms are from the Third World. While the twenty-four First World firms were more profitable, the difference was only marginal. Similarly, in specialised chemicals, there were twenty-four First World companies to ten Third World. The profits of the top five of these First World companies were $8.5 billion, compared to $5.4 billion for the top five Third World companies. There is a similar statistical trend in both oil and gas operations and oil services and equipment. However, in both cases, the figures for Third World refer almost exclusively to profitable Russian companies. As such, it is difficult to view this as a rise of Third World profitability in a similar sense to the ex-colonial countries. <div>\\#### Five sectors of no dominance In the smaller undiversified metals sector, Third World presence goes even further. In \u2018iron and steel\u2019, there is almost the same number of imperialist as Third World companies, yet Third World-based companies make up six of the top ten companies, including the top two. The top five Third World firms made $13.6 billion in profits, while the top five First World firms made only $6.8 billion. In \u2018aluminium\u2019, five of the nine companies are Third World based. The only firm to make a profit over $1 billion was the Russian firm, Rusal, indicating just how low profit this sector was in 2017.The more profitable sectors of \u2018no dominance\u2019, in contrast to the raw materials sectors above, are characterised by domestic monopoly. In \u2018major banks\u2019, for example, giant Chinese banks with the highest profits are all domestic. None of these are international banks that compete with the US and European banks in global operations. Similarly, \u2018construction services\u2019 and \u2018diversified utilities\u2019 are characterised, principally, by domestic monopoly. \u2018Diversified utilities\u2019 is in fact a small sub-branch of \u2018utilities\u2019. With only twelve companies, it is tiny compared to the imperialist-dominated \u2018electrical utilities\u2019, which has 116 companies listed. Construction services is certainly a big sector, especially in China. However, what the large number of Chinese corporations in this sector reveals is largely the huge domestic construction activity in that country.<\/div> #### Three sectors of Third World dominance Easily the most profitable sector of Third World dominance is \u2018regional banks\u2019, which we discover are bigger and more numerous (133 versus 123) in the Third World than in the imperialist states. No doubt this is <a href=\"\" id=\"p181\"><\/a>partly because the Third World, with 85 per cent of world population, has many regions. This is certainly a big and lucrative sector. The top five banks (Chinese, Brazilian and Russian) made a combined profit of $56.3 billion. Yet, again, this does not indicate a competitive victory against imperialist capital but a domestic monopolistic position. Another of the sectors \u2013 \u2018educational and training services\u2019 \u2013 is not really a sector at all. The sole company listed is Kroton Educacional from Brazil, with a profit of only half a billion dollars. While Kroton\u2019s lonely \u2018success\u2019 may represent a high degree of domestic monopoly, it seems clear this is a statistical anomaly reflecting that large US and other imperialist universities are not publicly traded and hence not listed. This leaves just one category of true Third World dominance where there is international competition \u2013 \u2018household appliances\u2019. There are just six firms in the sector. The three Third World firms (all Chinese) made double the profit of the three imperialist firms. However, the total profit for the entire sector was just $7.3 billion \u2013 that is, less than half the profits of, for example, Johnson and Johnson or Gilead Sciences (Table 11.3). Capitalist expansion in the neoliberal period resulted in few Third World companies rising to the apex of the global economy. If it were justified to count Russia separately, owing to its exceptional history and development, the numbers are even starker. The small number of exceptional sectors in which Third World competition has either displaced imperialist dominance or threatened to do so are either small, relatively unprofitable sectors or are made so by the presence of Third World capital. That is, by breaking imperialist monopoly in these sectors, Third World capital also breaks monopoly as such, including for itself. This pattern conforms entirely to the thesis presented in this chapter that what has developed in the Third World is non-monopolistic capitalism. Nothing is new in this. Just as clothing manufacture long ceased to be the domain of the imperialist world, we should not be surprised if low-end steel and aluminium production, or the mass production of domestic washing machines, refrigerators, air-conditioners or basic automobile assembly are in the future transferred more fully to the Third World (assuming these are not further mechanised). It is hardly conceivable that this not be the case for certain lines of production. If low-end steel and aluminium is further mechanised, preventing Third World dominance of that sector, then Third World dominance could be expected in a different sector \u2013 conceivably in bulk production of automobiles. The Third World\u2019s \u2018dominance\u2019 of clothing manufacture has evidently not led to the rise of Third World clothing monopolies.

Both historically and technically, for workers to be replaced by a machine, they must first be transformed, for a time, into a machine in the sense of performing machine-like tasks. This continues until these have become so routine and standard, or machine technology has advanced to such a point, that an actual machine can displace them. This is important in understanding the specific dynamics of imperialism today. In his study of China at the beginning of the present century, Steinfeld usefully highlights not only codified, modular processes (which he says characterised Chinese firms) but also their opposite \u2013 \u2018other activities that <a href=\"\" id=\"p186\"><\/a>are highly proprietary, as yet utterly uncodifiable, and highly lucrative\u2019, in which \u2018knowledge is embedded and sustainable competitive advantage is possible\u2019.<sup id=\"fnref13:4\"><a href=\"#fn:4\" class=\"footnote-ref\">4<\/a><\/sup> The latter, he points out, is characteristic of global \u2018lead firms\u2019.

In capitalist society \u2013 whether we are talking about pre-industrial manufacture, machine production or the contemporary polarised global division of labour (which is also based around machine production) \u2013 the creation at one pole of simple modular tasks (whether carried out by humans or machines) requires, at the other pole, the design, development, control, maintenance and management of these same processes. Hence, the parallel development of highly skilled labour and sophisticated production processes inevitably accompanies simple labour and bulk production.

This cost advantage of cheap labour over machines in certain spheres is accentuated by the general context of widespread excess productive capacity that has tended to exist in a range of industries since the mid-1970s. Large-scale machine production inevitably tends to produce a mass of undifferentiated \u2018bulk\u2019 commodities.

The tendency to export *labour-intensive* operations already presupposes the opposite of the production processes Marx considered most advanced.

They do so with all the organic limitations to increases in productivity that characterise all such human labour.

Panitch and Gindin, argue: \u2018The classical theories of imperialism developed at the time, from Hobson\u2019s to Lenin\u2019s, were founded on a theorization of capitalist economic stages and crises. This was a fundamental mistake that has, ever since, continued to plague proper understanding.
