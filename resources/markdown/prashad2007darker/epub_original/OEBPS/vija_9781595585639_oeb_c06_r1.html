<b>TEHRAN</b>
<div class="tx1">One million dollars. That’s all it took in 1953 for the CIA to overthrow a nationalist government. Langley’s man in Tehran was Kermit “Kim” Roosevelt, the grandson of Teddy Roosevelt. Ordered to take out the democratically elected National Front government led by Muhammed Mosaddeq and restore the Shah of Iran, Roosevelt spread the cash and waited for it to do its magic. The army, the aristocrats, and other upwardly mobile class fragments went into action and overthrew a government that had stretched the imagination of the Iranian people. The Shah returned to stay until he was overthrown by a different kind of coup in 1979.</div>
<div class="tx">Mosaddeq had a long career in Iranian politics before the Iranian people called him to lead them in 1951. That year, the Iranian parliament, the <i>Majlis</i>, nationalized the country’s oil industry (owned by the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, where “Anglo” represented the English interests and “Iranian” simply referred to the place from which they drew the oil). When the prime minister, who had opposed the nationalization, was assassinated, the parliament turned to Mosaddeq to take it forward. The popularity of Mosaddeq and his National Front forced the Shah to accept the Oil Nationalization Act. Mosaddeq removed the English from the equation and founded the National Iranian Oil Company, the first nationalized oil firm in the oil lands (the Free Officers in Egypt took great inspiration from this action).</div>
<div class="tx">The British and U.S. governments flexed their muscles, the Shah refused to turn over the military to the parliament, and Mosaddeq resigned. People filled the streets: they came from all the political parties, <?dp n="97" folio="76" ?> and from among the country’s intelligentsia. The Tudeh Party (heir to the Communist Party founded in 1920) had a cadre of 25,000, while its union federation boasted a membership of 335,000.<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en226" id="Ref-en226"><sup>1</sup></a> The influence of the Tudeh angered the U.S. establishment, which offered the National Front leader a choice: either crush the Communists, take U.S. aid and remain in power, or else fall under Soviet-Communist influence. On May 2, 1953, Mosaddeq revealed the shallowness of his class, whose investment in nationalism and national sovereignty only went as far as it would guarantee its rule and luxury; he wrote a letter to President Dwight D. Eisenhower, in which he cowered, “Please accept, Mr. President, the assurances of my highest consideration.”<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en227" id="Ref-en227"><sup>2</sup></a> Afraid of the Soviets, Mosaddeq crushed the Tudeh Party, thereby destroying the most organized defenders of Iranian sovereignty, and then fell before a coup engineered by the CIA’s representative and a far more reliable U.S. ally, the Shah.</div>

<div class="tx">The Shah exiled tens of thousands of National Party members and <?dp n="98" folio="77" ?> Communists, and killed thousands of both. Tudeh, which means “masses,” was reduced in size by brute force, as its members either went underground, into the Shah’s jails, or else to Europe, where they reconstituted. The Tudeh was paralyzed by the coup. The USSR paid it little heed, preferring to make every concession to the Shah in hopes of pacifying a border state and gaining access to the oil—all this despite the close relationship between the United States and the Shah.<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en228" id="Ref-en228"><sup>3</sup></a></div>
<div class="tx">Out of Tudeh came disaffected intellectuals, among whom numbered the best of Farsi letters. Enthused by the Mosaddeq moment, by the possibility of a socially just nationalism (guaranteed by the presence of a strong Tudeh Party), they had written manifestos and poems, short stories and diatribes. The cultural suffocation of imperialism and the feudal aristocracy had been lifted by the Mosaddeq moment, and even with the restoration of the Shah, this cultural productivity on the terrain of nationalism continued. The intellectuals and cultural workers who had been motivated by anticolonialism, antimonarchism, and the militancy of the Tudeh movement regrouped in the early 1950s into small organizations. One such was Niru-ye Sevum (the Third Force), led by Khalil Maleki, who had left Tudeh in 1947. Maleki prepared the ground for others to follow in the next few years. These people disparaged First World capitalism and Second World socialism. They took refuge briefly in Mosaddeq’s National Front, even as they remained suspicious of the hesitancy and conservatism of the bourgeois party. They were essentially cultural workers who disliked equally the hierarchies of America’s market economy as much as the arid monotony of the Khrushchev era socialist bureaucracy.<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en229" id="Ref-en229"><sup>4</sup></a> As artists, they longed for the space to let the spirit soar free, and neither of these options provided a way forward from the Shah.</div>
<div class="tx">The strong emphasis both on liberty and social justice attracted a wide following among an intelligentsia that had no loyalty to royalty, and little fealty to a political party that increasingly burdened itself with the foreign policy needs of the USSR. Maleki’s journal carried imaginative discussions of the type of modernity envisaged by the Third World, by his Third Force. In 1955, one of his journals, <i>Nabard-e Zendegi</i>, ran a poem titled “Call to Arms” by Forugh Farrokhzad:<div class="atx1"><div class="tx1">O Iranian woman, only you have remained, <br/>In the bonds of cruelty and wretchedness and misfortune. <br/>It is your warm embracing bosom that has nurtured <br/>Prideful and pompous man. <br/>It is your joyous smile that bestows <?dp n="99" folio="78" ?> <br/>On his heart vigor and warmth. <br/>For that person who is your creation <br/>To be preferred and superior is shameful. <br/>Woman, take action because a world <br/>Awaits and beckons you.<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en230" id="Ref-en230"><sup>5</sup></a></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="tx">Filled with leaden speeches, economic discussions, and organizational matters, nationalist periodicals nevertheless made room for poems and stories, drawings and photographs. The “nation” had to be imagined as well as thought through politically, economically, and culturally. The imagination played an enormous role in the construction of the nation, its states, and of course the Third World itself. Stories of humiliation and hope, poems of despair and revolution—these form part of the massive output of the imagination that made its way into the texts of national liberation. Farrokhzad’s verse is in that sense typical: there is the encomium to Iranian women for their buried labors, the condemnation of patriarchy for its rejection of women/mothers who have created the world, and a “call to arms” for women to birth a new kind of order. In these three moments—praise, condemnation, and war cry—there is the basic structure of the national liberation story. It charts out the past and demands an engagement with the future.</div>
<div class="tx">Farrokhzad’s powerful verse inspired much discussion within Iran, and after her untimely death at the age of thirty-two, she became an icon for those who wanted to push the boundaries of modernity. The editor of <i>Nabard-e Zendegi</i> at the time was an eminence of Persian letters, and although he had differences with Farrokhzad, Jalal Al-e Ahmad cherished her work. Like Malecki, Al-e Ahmad had been in the Tudeh Party during its most productive phase (1944–48), and then, from 1951–53, he supported Mosaddeq’s government. The return of the Shah, and Al-e Ahmad’s outspoken criticism of the monarchy, earned him the leadership of the disaffected intelligentsia. Al-e Ahmad substituted the hopelessness of militant action in this period for the expansiveness of the imagination. He produced a remarkable corpus of short stories that counterposed the corruption and ruthlessness of the monarchy with the simple wisdom of folklore and the forgotten people of Iran.<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en231" id="Ref-en231"><sup>6</sup></a> He wrote a series of caustic novels about the “underdevelopment” of Iranian society and the feeling of hopelessness that confronted the intellectual; what must a teacher do, for instance, when the promise of education and cultural transfer is insufficient in such a hierarchical and unequal world?<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en232" id="Ref-en232"><sup>7</sup></a> This crisis for the teacher in an underdeveloped society (whose students <?dp n="100" folio="79" ?> have no shoes, for example) mirrors the principal contradiction for the Third World in the realm of culture: committed to the notion of an egalitarian society and culture, and yet within the context of immense inequality, how would the teacher come to terms with their position “above” that of their students? In the realm of the franchise and literacy, which I will develop further below, this problem arises as well: everyone must have the franchise regardless of their level of literacy, yet people need to be literate in order to enlarge their social and political selves.</div>
<div class="tx">It was far easier to concentrate on an all-points assault on cultural imperialism than to delve too long on the more pressing problem of expansive values and uneven realities. Al-e Ahmad, therefore, is best known not for the subtle way in which he raised important questions of cultural workers but for his 1961–62 screed against what his friend Ahmed Farid had called <i>Gharabzadegi</i> or “Occidentosis.” Invited by the Iranian government to present a paper at the Congress on the Aim of Iranian Education, Al-e Ahmad offered a long manifesto on the collapse of the dignity of Asia, Africa, and Latin America before Europe’s onslaught. Not only had Europe managed to conquer, colonize, and reshape the political economy of these continents but it had also been able to put them in cultural crisis. This crisis formed the topic of Al-e Ahmad’s vibrant critique.</div>
<div class="tx">From the “West,” Al-e Ahmad argued, came the disease of Occidentosis. Europe said it was materially and morally superior: its material strength needed no résumé, and it had this great material advance on the basis of its moral and cultural inheritance. Europe had a Reformation, a Luther, the Enlightenment, the French Revolution, and the Industrial Revolution. The last followed from the chain that preceded it. If the rest of the world wanted to advance and attain industry, then it must also have a Reformation. Writers like Mexico’s Octavio Paz concurred: “We never had a Kant, a Voltaire, a Diderot, or a Hume.”<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en233" id="Ref-en233"><sup>8</sup></a> If Mexico had had such figures, and such movements, then it would not be in its relative poverty.</div>
<div class="tx">Al-e Ahmad knew that this was an inversion of the problem. A Reformation does not lead to the Industrial Revolution—indeed, to see cultural and economic history in such a way is to miss the theft of the wealth of the Americas for the glory of Europe, and the development of European liberalism in relationship to the degradation of the rights of the people in the colonies.<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en234" id="Ref-en234"><sup>9</sup></a> Along the grain of the ECLA view of underdevelopment, Al-e Ahmad described the world as being sundered between “two poles or extremes.... One pole is held by the sated—the wealthy, the powerful, <?dp n="101" folio="80" ?> the makers and exporters of manufacturers. The other pole is left to the hungry—the poor, the impotent, the importers and consumers. The beat of progress is in the ascending part of the world, and the pulse of stagnation is in the moribund part of the world.”<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en235" id="Ref-en235"><sup>10</sup></a></div>
<div class="tx">Although Iran had never been formerly colonized, it belonged with the hungry. Indeed, much of the world that stood at the pole of the hungry had remained nominally free during the era of colonialism. South America and some islands of the Caribbean won their political independence in the eighteenth century, and sections of Africa remained free, as did China and about half of India. Colonial conquest played only a part of the overall domination of the planet by European and U.S. imperialism. English oil firms (or at least an Englishman, William Knox D’Arcy) had dominated Iran’s oil fields since 1901, and oil continued to be the major export from this large, nominally independent nation. Iran’s government paid for the infrastructure to remove the oil, and earned a pittance from the oil company cartel. Not for nothing did Mosaddeq’s struggle over oil earn him the affection of the masses.<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en236" id="Ref-en236"><sup>11</sup></a></div>
<div class="tx">What the Iranian elite did with their small share of the oil profits baffled intellectuals like Al-e Ahmad. To the taste of these intellectuals, the elite (led by the aristocracy) imported meaningless commodities, including weaponry. Al-e Ahmad blamed the elite for this selfish consumption, but for him the lion’s share of the fault rested with the imperialist system. “Once you have given economic and political control of your country to foreign concerns,” Al-e Ahmad bemoaned, “they know what to sell you, or at least what not to sell you. Because they naturally seek to sell you their manufacturers in perpetuity, it is best that you remain forever in need of them, and God save the oil reserves. They take away the oil and give you whatever you want in return—from soup to nuts, even grain. This enforced trade even extends to cultural matters, to letters, to discourse.”<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en237" id="Ref-en237"><sup>12</sup></a> The Iranian elite, like much of the parasitic elite in the postcolonial world, groomed their aesthetic sense around Europe’s Sublime. Educational systems and the media as well as cultural purveyors did not <i>teach</i> the population about its own customs and traditions. Imperialism had sundered the organic relationship with these dynamics. The disruption of the links between the various classes resulted in the creation of an aesthetic and socioeconomic gulf. Al-e Ahmad’s contribution to excise this gulf was his ethnographies, although these too are not without their attempt at the colonial preservation of heritages rather than the creation of a linkage between the rulers and the ruled.<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en238" id="Ref-en238"><sup>13</sup></a></div>
<?dp n="102" folio="81" ?><div class="tx">The general critique of cultural imperialism stays within a narrow ambit, because it is only the elite or the urban sections that have access to the symbolic and material items that enter the Third World (this has of course changed with the entry of television). Since the vast bulk cannot afford the actual cultural products of Carnaby Street and Madison Avenue, Hollywood and the Sorbonne, the problem of the import of these items is not necessarily a <i>mass</i> dilemma. What Al-e Ahmad rehearses is the conceptual problem, where people of the “East” continue to see themselves as lesser than the “West.” The overwhelming military and industrial power of the “West” produces an immense hallucination that what it does is History and only what it does matters, whereas the rest of us are to remain in a cyclic stupor, in awe and paralysis.<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en239" id="Ref-en239"><sup>14</sup></a> It is this fact that Al-e Ahmad wanted the Third World to acknowledge.</div>
<div class="tx">Such a critique is not original to Al-e Ahmad. Most of the Third World produced cultural workers who came to the same conclusion, some in poetic anger, and others with abstract analysis. In the 1930s, at least two strands for the regeneration of the darker nations emerged: from the Francophone black Atlantic came the idea of <i>négritude</i>, which suggested that a new self had to be crafted out of the harshly dismissed cultural resources of Africa and a new self-confidence in being black in the world needed to drive one’s visions; from Brazil, came the idea that social science would enable meaningful, positivistic economic development, which would engender a newly confident Brazilian personality.<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en240" id="Ref-en240"><sup>15</sup></a> By the 1950s, these two critical projects would by and large unite in the work of Third World cultural workers. In 1950, Aimé Césaire, one of the leading figures in the negritude movement, published his <i>Discourse on Colonialism</i>, which brought these two considerations into dialogue with each other. Most of these cultural workers had a career in and around their national Communist Party, which encouraged an aesthetic that did not depart from the material concerns of the masses. The economy and the imagination did not stray far from each other. Césaire, after all, was a leading figure in the French Communist Party by the mid-1940s, and even as he called for a spiritual regeneration of the postcolonial world, he nonetheless urged the economic development of the former colonies.</div>
<div class="tx">The contradictions and opportunities posed by these challenges from the 1930s emerged in relief at a 1956 conference hosted in Paris to promote the journal <i>Présence Africaine</i>. The most influential writers from the black Atlantic gathered to push these ideas around (they included Léopold Senghor, Césaire, Richard Wright, and Frantz Fanon). Alioune Diop, the <?dp n="103" folio="82" ?> founder and editor of <i>Présence Africaine</i>, welcomed the delegates: “If to the non-European mind the Bandung meeting has been the most important event since the end of the War, I venture to assert that this First International Congress of Black Writers and Artists will be regarded by our peoples as the second event of the decade.”<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en241" id="Ref-en241"><sup>16</sup></a> The conference’s central theme was that “culture” matters, and that an engagement with cultural development was central to the postcolonial project, even as there could be no such engagement without an assessment of the role of culture in economic underdevelopment.<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en242" id="Ref-en242"><sup>17</sup></a> The analysts insisted on the centrality of the cultural even when starvation peered over the horizon (after all, economic debates often relied on cultural stereotypes that needed to be expunged). Several presentations took the easy way out: they inverted the values of colonialism and plugged in various shades of nativism. Europe could be dismissed out of hand because the answers to Africa and elsewhere lay within their autochthonous traditions. It was this passive caricature of negritude that earned it scorn from the more radical thinkers (such as Fanon at the 1956 conference) and the militants (such as the anticolonial fighters from Portuguese-controlled Africa and elsewhere at the 1969 second conference held in Algiers).<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en243" id="Ref-en243"><sup>18</sup></a> Indigenous traditions could contribute to the solution, but most cultural workers agreed that they were insufficient against the problems posed by imperialism.</div>
<div class="tx">Most of the presentations, and indeed most of the cultural commentary from the Third World, walked a fine line between the reification of the divide between the colonizer and the colonized, and the treatment of it as dialectical. Even deft Césaire entertained the former route, before his analysis dragged him to the latter. Colonialism, Césaire pointed out, squelches the cultural confidence of the colonized. Colonizers denigrate the cultural world of the defeated, thereby impoverishing the idea of culture for everyone. The dynamic interaction of cultural forms and the vibrancy of culture itself were stopped by colonialism, which removed Europe’s culture and cultural heritage onto a pedestal away from all influence and interaction. From this Archimedean point, Europe could judge and dissect other cultures. But the complex cultural forms of Europe and the darker nations would only be able to sit side by side, “juxtaposed but not harmonized.” Cultural objects arrive and interact, but they do not inform each other. “Foreign elements are dumped on its soil, but remain foreign. White man’s things! White man’s manners! Things existing alongside the native but over which the native has no power.” Water flush toilets, Rembrandt, movable type: these arrive, they are used, but they are not intertwined into the living culture of the <?dp n="104" folio="83" ?> colonized. The dichotomy stalls history; people stand before machines, they might even use them, yet they are unable to bring them into their lives.</div>
<div class="tx">The dichotomous view of culture produced the idea, Césaire noted, that anticolonial nationalism is dominated by “obscurantist forces priding themselves on reviving medieval ways of life and thought.”<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en244" id="Ref-en244"><sup>19</sup></a> But would this be far from the truth, for chauvinisms of various kinds had begun to appear in the postcolonial world (for example, in 1972, Uganda’s Idi Amin expelled Indians from the country—a policy that descended from the 1945 and 1949 anti-Indian riots in Kampala and Jinja; in 1969, Malaysia would experience terrible anti-Chinese riots—a result of chauvinist sentiments within the Malaysian freedom movement of the 1940s)? Short of chauvinism, there was also a cultural fantasy about those who remained traditional, untouched by modernity and therefore authentically national.<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en245" id="Ref-en245"><sup>20</sup></a> Diop, for instance, offered the conference an illustration: “The same Fulah shepherd whose knowledge of his local flora and fauna astonishes you by its accuracy, is likely to join with his companions in poetical jousts which afford a heartening spectacle. On top of this, he has a passionate sense of the history of his people, a lucid and well founded love of the heroes of his past, a solid knowledge of the classics of his culture and a natural familiarity with the conditions and economic laws which govern his existence.”<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en246" id="Ref-en246"><sup>21</sup></a> This singular omnipresent shepherd is a dangerous fantasy. Communities that refused to abandon their ways outside the full-blown exercise of the market economy and the accoutrements of consumer society came in for a double dose of romanticism and ostracism. These “tribals” became objects of national fascination at the same time as their lands became areas for the predatory extraction of raw materials. Whether the Amazon region or southern Bihar, the Central American highlands or the Central African lowlands—nationalist regimes romanticized the tribals and dispossessed them (or else confined them into reservations euphemistically called national parks).<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en247" id="Ref-en247"><sup>22</sup></a> Cultural workers who operated with a dichotomous notion of culture did not conduct the necessary critique of colonial stereotypes. They often inhabited them, not to revile, but to celebrate. The tribals, or the rural peasants, would be a symbol of the nation, but they would not inhabit the nation. They remained outside it, either to be confined or else converted, but not to be considered as full citizens.</div>
<div class="tx">Césaire moved away from the antinomic quality of this analysis, even if only partially; for cultures, he said, are powerful and have “enough regenerative power to adapt themselves to the conditions of the modern <?dp n="105" folio="84" ?> world.”<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en248" id="Ref-en248"><sup>23</sup></a> The British dumped tea on India after they could no longer absorb the Chinese exports; within a generation, tea became a staple drink of the subcontinent. The debates in Paris took place in French. These pedestrian examples show us that the dichotomies are not static, and that cultural worlds are alive to absorption, change, and dynamism. Nevertheless, one cannot make too much of culture’s flexibility, because the high walls of privilege and power make some cultures <i>appear</i> dead. A civilization needs to “feel” alive, and it is this subjective liveliness that gives it “the power to <i>leave behind the past</i>.” Colonized societies come alive and thus are ready to be refashioned only in the throes of a major social upheaval, such as an anticolonial struggle. Césaire offers two examples of this, the first from Tunisia, where the new nationalist government nationalized Habu properties and abolished polygamy, and the second from India, where the new nationalist government shook the traditional status of women. In both cases, the colonial power did not take the side of justice, whereas the nationalist regime had begun to create cultural change.<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en249" id="Ref-en249"><sup>24</sup></a> To develop Césaire’s formula of culture “juxtaposed but not harmonized,” or else brought alive by struggle, let us look more closely at the three major social processes of the modern world (nationalism, democracy, and rationalism).</div>
<div class="tx">By and large, the Third World states rejected the idea of nationalism that emerged from Europe’s history—where the various bourgeoisies constructed their nationalism to create discrete boundaries and markets around what they saw as common cultural markers, such as language, history, and race.<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en250" id="Ref-en250"><sup>25</sup></a> The Third World, from Indonesia to Guatemala, adopted the idea of multiplicity (Indonesia’s motto is “<i>Bhinneka Tung-gal Ika</i>,” or “Unity in Diversity,” a pluralist approach to difference; Guatemala’s solution lay in the promotion of <i>mestizaje</i>, or cultural hybridity—these are different approaches to multiplicity, which is not to say that they always accommodated their minority populations).<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en251" id="Ref-en251"><sup>26</sup></a> The new states adopted a multinational perspective, knowing full well that their countries were culturally diverse. This was a <i>practical</i> measure; many of the new states grew on culturally mixed societies that could not be easily homogenized. Certainly, most of them adopted one or two national languages, but they had to perforce acknowledge the existence and often support the persistence of multiple languages. Sometimes, the attempt to suppress one or more cultural communities led to separatist movements, such as among the Karen in Burma or the Ashanti in Ghana. The general trend, however, was to accept that one could not replicate what Kemal Ataturk had done in Turkey: to take complexity <?dp n="106" folio="85" ?> and enforce uniformity (indeed, the struggle by the Kurds within Turkey shows that even there the strategy failed).</div>
<div class="tx">The move to multinationalism was pragmatic, but also <i>principled</i>. At UNESCO’s 1945 founding conference, the Cuban delegate Luis Perez spoke wistfully about national education policies based on a multinational ethos. “Diversity rather than uniformity should be encouraged,” he said, “for it would be a disaster to the world to suppress differences and refreshing tendencies in matters of education.”<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en252" id="Ref-en252"><sup>27</sup></a> Colonial regimes had attempted to divide their subject populations in order to better rule them; in India they crowned “princes” and elevated certain castes, in Iraq they promoted sheikhs, and in the Arab lands and Africa the colonial leaders tapped some tribal leaders and stoked tribal “instincts.”<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en253" id="Ref-en253"><sup>28</sup></a> Against this, nationalist politicians and intellectuals found the historical basis for political pluralism in, for example, the identification of “composite cultures” and syncretism among the people’s cultures.<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en254" id="Ref-en254"><sup>29</sup></a> That is, the multinational state would need to both <i>evoke</i> this historical dynamic of fellowship and <i>produce</i> it through the adoption of an official policy of diversity in religion (secularism), racialism (antiracism), and language (multilingualism). The multinational perspective questioned the racist claim that the darker nations could only be primordial, that blood and custom reduced the imagination of certain people. They could only be tied to kin and co-believer, not to a republican nationalism whose locus was both anticolonial and populist.</div>
<div class="tx">In this realm at least, Third World nationalist movements absorbed the idea of nationalism and digested it in accord with the rhythms and demands of their various histories. Fanon, who had learned about cultural regeneration in Algeria, developed the second strand of Césaire’s cultural program in terms of the idea of nationalism. Like Césaire, Fanon argued that the period of nationalist struggle enabled a people to rethink the feudal forms legitimized by colonialism. These liberation struggles, as opposed to those for conquest, did not feel the need to justify themselves based on crude biological concepts. The colonial power tries to mobilize every racist idea to break down the morale of nationalism, but with each such attempt the imputed superiority of the colonizer wanes. The people, once held down, now determined the pace of change. “Those who were once immobile, the congenital cowards, those lazy beings who have always been made inferior, brace themselves and emerge bristling.” The colonial ruler does not understand what has transpired. “The end of racism begins with this sudden failure to understand.” Finally, the end of colonialism means that the “rigid, spasmic <?dp n="107" folio="86" ?> culture of the occupier is liberated,” and it opens itself up to the culture of the colonized. “The two cultures can confront one another, enrich one another.” Rather than turn inward, away from Europe or any others, Fanon contends, nationalist culture will explore other cultures as resources. <a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en255" id="Ref-en255"><sup>30</sup></a> In the struggle lies liberation, or at least the process of national struggle gives energy to the national culture, which is now able to come alive and grow. Fanon overplays the lack of racism or the mobilization of biological notions in national liberation movements. National pride or patriotism often slid into the ugly language of racism or exclusion. But if what Fanon found is not a fundamental rule, it is at least a tendency.<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en256" id="Ref-en256"><sup>31</sup></a></div>
<div class="tx">For its proponents, the notion of multinationalism was an idealist conceit. They hoped that people would respect each other (diversity), and that since their cultural worlds already overlapped, they would need to tolerate distinctions (composite culture). But more than that, the expectation of the national project was that the construction of markets and educational institutions would disallow differences to dominate social life. An overarching unity (a national identity) would supersede (but not subvert) the other social identities. Identification with the national project could be more important than the sedimented identities that one inherited. There was an unrecognized problem within this otherwise-valuable liberal project: it had a majoritarian cast. It is easy for the demographic majority in a society to ask for the suspension of identity, whose cultural features would anyway seep into the culture of the nation—for example, which religious holidays should be recognized by the state, which language should be promoted, or whose version of a contested history should be recounted. Culture is not a zero-sum game, and historians would be able to write contesting histories, so that this problem is not inherent to the construction of nations. For minority communities that already felt beleaguered, it was harder to voluntarily disregard the social significance of their identities. The multinational idea had a great attraction for them partly because it was <i>not</i> majoritarianism, yet it also posed problems because it had not come to terms with the accidental majoritarianism of national culture.</div>
<div class="tx">To produce or evoke the ethos of multinationalism, the nation-state had to assemble a history and an aesthetic. In most countries, the colonial rulers had already put together archives of their rule and what preceded them as well as museums and libraries that collected the material and symbolic record of native society. It was now the task of the nationalist intelligentsia to study these archives, add to them, and reinterpret <?dp n="108" folio="87" ?> them in a new light. Most of the new nations added a raft of institutions to formulate, craft, and disseminate the history, artistry, and indeed self-perception of the nation. India’s Sahitya Akademi, Egypt’s Public Authority for the Book, and Ghana’s National Research Council exemplify the new nation’s attempt to create major, decently funded national institutions for cultural development. The creation of the cultural canon came alongside its dissemination through mobile libraries, literacy campaigns, theater groups, motion picture vans, and the radio.</div>
<div class="tx">Canons had to be created, but what would be their temper? Given the broad commitment to multiplicity, the new nation had to protect the canon from chauvinism. It had to promote the idea of the composite culture or an inherent tendency toward syncretism. Of course, an element of defensiveness creeps into the narrative, which bodes ill for the liberal values that otherwise inform the enterprise. For instance, Césaire offers a brief summary of the contributions of the darker nations to humanity—“to wit, the invention of arithmetic and geometry by the Egyptians. To wit, the discovery of astronomy by the Assyrians. To wit, the birth of chemistry among the Arabs.”<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en257" id="Ref-en257"><sup>32</sup></a> Despite the anxiety to demonstrate the value of the colonized world, one can still glimpse Césaire’s catholicity, for he does not carry water only for the black Atlantic but also for the Arabs, the Assyrians, and others.</div>
<div class="tx">The national canon had to include the cultural practices and hopes of all the communities within a nation, and it had to include the cultural interconnections with the cultural worlds of other nation-states. At UNESCO’s founding conference in 1945, the delegates agreed, “No longer must our children be taught to think in terms only of the glory of their own country; they must think of their country as being no more than a unit in and dedicated to the service of the larger whole of a world state.”<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en258" id="Ref-en258"><sup>33</sup></a> At the 1958 Afro-Asian Peoples’ Solidarity Conference, Chu Tu-Nan of China offered a report on cultural exchange, in which he detailed many of the connections between Africa and Asia, from the Egyptian-Mesopotamian contact in the ancient world to the early modern Chinese ships that traveled to Africa. He described the atrociously difficult transit of Buddhist and Arab rationalists, who traveled from the Mediterranean to Malaysia, from India to Japan. Then he spoke of the Silk Road, which “like a colorful ribbon bound together the cultural life of the Chinese and the Near and Middle East peoples.” The cultural artery not only moved people and goods but also seeds and animals, flowers and fruits, ideas and dreams.<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en259" id="Ref-en259"><sup>34</sup></a></div>
<div class="tx">At Bandung, the Third World’s intellectuals and nationalist leaders wanted to restart this dynamic, but “not from any sense of exclusiveness <?dp n="109" folio="88" ?> or rivalry with other groups of nations and other civilizations and cultures.” The motivation had to be the “age-old tradition of tolerance and universality,” whose purpose would be to “enrich their own culture and would also help in the promotion of world peace and understanding.”<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en260" id="Ref-en260"><sup>35</sup></a> The section under which this discussion took place was significantly called “Cultural Cooperation” not cultural purity or cultural presentation. To this end, the Afro-Asian nations held several conferences of Afro-Asian Writers (New Delhi, 1957; Tashkent, 1958; Cairo, 1962; and Beirut, 1967) and several Asian Film Weeks (the first in Beijing, 1957). Alongside these meetings, the writers published <i>Lotus</i>, the magazine of the Afro-Asian Writers’ Movement, and selected one story a year for their Lotus Award.<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en261" id="Ref-en261"><sup>36</sup></a> In Latin America, the 1959 creation of the Casa de Las Americas in Havana under the stewardship of the Cuban revolutionary Haydée Santamaría provided a venue for Latin American artists similar to the Afro-Asian cultural conferences.</div>
<div class="tx">One of the ways forward, noted the Indian delegate to the UNESCO conference Rajkumari Amrit Kaur, was for the translation of books, both classic and modern, into every language. This desire to seek out cross-national appreciation for cultural heritages illustrates the best of Third World nationalism. A nation’s culture had to be alive, and it had to be supplemented from other’s cultural resources. Connections provided the oxygen for culture. India’s Sahitya Akademi, for instance, not only translated novels from one Indian language into another but also translated novels and collections of short stories from elsewhere in the world.<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en262" id="Ref-en262"><sup>37</sup></a> There were some favorites around the Third World: Pablo Neruda’s poems, Mulk Raj Anand’s novels, and Lu Xun’s short stories. The list of books that carried across languages has a decidedly masculine cast. Few of the innovative books by women found their translators until the 1970s: Magda Portal’s <i>La Trampa</i> (Peru, 1954), Assia Djebar’s <i>Le Soif</i> (Algeria, 1957), and Ding Ling’s <i>The Sun Shines over the Sankan River</i> (China, 1947, which gained popularity in the Second World after it won the Stalin Prize). Portal not only wrote the wonderful <i>La Trampa</i> but was also the co-founder with Haya de la Torre of the APRA Party as well as the author of little-known socialist feminist tracts, such as <i>Ha-cia la mujer nueva</i> (<i>Toward a New Woman</i>) and <i>El Aprismo y la mujer</i> (<i>Women in the APRA Party</i>, 1933).<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en263" id="Ref-en263"><sup>38</sup></a> Al-e Ahmad’s 1961 critique of cultural imperialism assaults Iranians for their concentration on “news of the Nobel Prize, of the new pope, of Françoise Sagan, the Cannes Film Festival, the latest Broadway play, the latest Hollywood film.” But this criticism did not move inward. Instead, he asked, “What news do you <?dp n="110" folio="89" ?> see of our part of the world? Of the east in the broadest terms? Of India, Japan, China?”<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en264" id="Ref-en264"><sup>39</sup></a> And further, because his was not an involuted nationalism, he translated work from French and Russian letters into Farsi, including by authors such as Fyodor Mikhaylovich Dostoyevsky, Eugène Ionesco, André Gide, Jean-Paul Sartre, and Albert Camus. Al-e Ahmad also wrote elegiac descriptions of his travels to the United States, the Soviet Union, Saudi Arabia, and interestingly, Israel.</div>
<div class="tx">The Third World states incorporated the idea of nationalism quite effortlessly. They produced a novel rendition of national belonging, thereby enabling the idea of multinationalism to have an organic relationship with the new states. The absorption of democracy and literacy, two allied concepts, entered the social grammar of the Third World equally easily. On the ideological level, every Third World state adopted the idea of democracy as fundamental to itself (even antidemocratic states justified themselves with the language of democracy).<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en265" id="Ref-en265"><sup>40</sup></a> The claim of cultural backwardness justified colonial rule, so national movements typically argued for self-rule on the ground of cultural maturity.<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en266" id="Ref-en266"><sup>41</sup></a> The question of the franchise was therefore moot: everyone would get the vote, regardless of literacy and social status. Most new nations did not need a suffrage movement, because ipso facto the population would get to vote. Despite this, however, the question of the franchise (and liberal democracy in general) brought the issue of literacy front and center.</div>
<div class="tx">At the 1958 Cairo conference, the Sudanese delegate Mohamed Ahmed Mahgoub announced, “All individuals who have come of age [must] enjoy the right to elect and to be elected to parliament without any reservations.”<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en267" id="Ref-en267"><sup>42</sup></a> People must have the vote despite their level of formal education, but the state must promote formal education in order to raise the cultural and political literacy of the population. The demand for the word, for literacy, came enveloped with the victory of the vote, the franchise. Illiteracy is not a function of the population’s stupidity but its lack of opportunity. Education had to be provided. UNESCO and other international agencies maintained that literacy campaigns had to be coupled with mass campaigns for social justice.<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en268" id="Ref-en268"><sup>43</sup></a> People were motivated by campaigns that addressed their everyday grievances, and in these sorts of campaigns the new nations integrated the project of literacy. In other words, the articulation of democracy and literacy within this form of anticolonial nationalism was not simply about the franchise; it was always also (and sometimes only) about social development. In 1965, Tehran hosted the World Conference of Ministers of Education on the Eradication of Illiteracy, which pledged to continue the linkage <?dp n="111" folio="90" ?> between literacy campaigns and specific socioeconomic development projects.<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en269" id="Ref-en269"><sup>44</sup></a> That same year, under pressure from the advanced industrial states, UNESCO shifted its funding strategies from mass campaigns to more strictly educational training. Nevertheless, a combination of innovative strategies within the new nations and UNESCO’s efforts dramatically reduced illiteracy across the planet; in 1950, according to UNESCO, two out of three men and one out of four women could read in any language, whereas in 1995, 80 percent of men and 70 percent of women entered the world of letters.</div>
<div class="tx">There was an additional imperative for education and literacy, which was the necessity recognized by most intellectuals like Al-e Ahmad and Césaire that their societies required a shy with the Enlightenment. Rationality and rationalism might have had roots in many societies, but Europe certainly had the most full-blown intellectual development along these lines. From the science of the self to the science of nature, European intellectual life had been suffused with skepticism for received truths (including religion), and had crafted both empirical and theoretical means to understand the world.<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en270" id="Ref-en270"><sup>45</sup></a> Al-e Ahmad and others recognized this, and they also knew that their own societies could not afford to ignore the emergence of rationalism in the world. In a defensive vein, many of them, including Césaire as we saw above, showed that the growth of rationalism in Europe had a lineage that stretched outward into the darker world (for example, there could be no mathematics without the Indian and Arab contribution; or that the Chinese independently invented explosives and many chemical processes). A crude rendition of this defensiveness contended that each cultural (and in this terrain, religious) world had its own science, so that there was an Islamic science, a Christian science, a Hindu science, and so forth.<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en271" id="Ref-en271"><sup>46</sup></a> Worse yet was the view that modern science was no more or less than ancient science (in other words, such a tendency invalidated progress). The Enlightenment challenged the Third World intelligentsia to engage with it, rather than whether to do so in the first place. Al-e Ahmad called this engagement <i>rushanfekri</i>, a way of the world that does not inculcate “blind obedience or fear of the supernatural” but instead insists that the social individual has the ability “to choose, to be free and responsible.”<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en272" id="Ref-en272"><sup>47</sup></a></div>
<div class="tx">In terms of scientific research and technology, the regimes in the new nations adopted the Enlightenment’s scientific heritage without any discussion of its cultural implications. This was insufficient. “History has fated the world to fall prey to the machine,” Al-e Ahmad noted, and so, <?dp n="112" folio="91" ?> the question to ask is, “how to encounter the machine and technology”? <a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en273" id="Ref-en273"><sup>48</sup></a> What is the best way for the machine to enable rushanfekri, or enlightenment, in accordance with the cultural history of Iran or elsewhere? When Césaire spoke of the juxtaposition and not the harmony of European culture with native cultures, one could think of the machine. Al-e Ahmad warned, as many others did, that the machine was not neutral. Colonialism brought the machine into spaces whose own cultural history had not prepared them for this new device, and besides, the machine and mechanization had been one of the instruments of cultural transformation. A machine is imbued with cultural forms; the tractor, for example, changes the relationship of farmers to their fields, each other, and the place of the plough in their cosmological world. The tractor would not leave the other social relations unchanged. Does the tractor carry within it the cultural revolution of centuries past that transformed the European fields into factories, and dispensed with small farms in favor of large agro-businesses and reduced the family farmer into the farmhand?</div>
<div class="tx">Furthermore, an insufficient interrogation of the role of the culture of a place and scientific thought meant that there was little concern for local ecologies, with their capacity to produce certain crops and improve irrigation in particular ways. Local knowledge was the historical accumulation of wisdom about local terrains and capacities. That social hierarchies of caste and clan came along with these encyclopedias of locality did not mean that much could not be learned from these traditions for democratic production. Most of the new states also experimented with communal and nonindustrial means of organization—from the Gandhian self-sufficient villages to the Tanzanian Ujamma collectives, across the Third World regimes tried out different forms of socioeconomic and cultural organization that refused the machine in one way or another. These were, but for a few places, the exception or even, to the cynical, the showcase. They did raise important questions of sustainability and equity, of the rights of the citizen to progress over the right to progress over the citizen. The bulk of the social order inhabited the machine and grew around it, and often ignored these warnings.</div>
<div class="tx">Al-e Ahmad and his contemporaries (including Ali Shariati, who drew from Al-e Ahmad as much as Herbert Marcuse) could only say that the dilemma was what to do with the machine. After raising the question, Al-e Ahmad ended with a whimper: “The machine should naturally serve us as a trampoline, so that we may stand on it and jump <?dp n="113" folio="92" ?> all the farther by its rebound. One must have the machine, one must build it. But one must not remain in bondage to it; one must not fall into its snare. The machine is a means, not an end. The end is to abolish poverty and to put material and spiritual welfare within the reach of all.”<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en274" id="Ref-en274"><sup>49</sup></a> In the next moment, Al-e Ahmad warned about the machine’s capacity to regiment everyday life (what Shariati called “machinism”). “Conformity in the workplace,” Al-e Ahmad wrote, “leads to conformity in the party and the union, and this itself leads to conformity in the barracks; that is, for the machines of war.” The roots of fascist militarism lie in the assembly line, unless the way that the machine operates is decisively reconstructed.<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en275" id="Ref-en275"><sup>50</sup></a> If the machine dominates life, then culture is at its mercy, and everything will have to obey its commands. The machine must be domesticated, it must become part of the fabric of the dynamic culture of a place. To the capitalist and the modernization theorist, the Lebanese philosopher and president of the UN General Assembly Charles Malik once said, “Roads, dams, efficiency, and the smile of the rulers—that is all that matters; but spirit, freedom, joy, happiness, truth, man—that never enters the mind. A world of perfect technicians is the aim, not a world of human beings, let alone of beings divine.”<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en276" id="Ref-en276"><sup>51</sup></a> To take control of culture, one had to take control of the machine, and to “develop” meant to do so both economically and culturally.</div>
<div class="tx">Nationalism, democracy, and rationalism: the root of the Third World intellectual’s quandary was how to create a new self in the new nations. Each of their societies had ample resources to fill this self, but they also recognized the necessity to articulate a new relationship with the “West.” Al-e Ahmad did not ask for the return to some pristine Iranian culture or even Islam as the solitary basis for the subjectivity of the new Iranian.<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en277" id="Ref-en277"><sup>52</sup></a> His affection for plebian Shiism meant that he sought a new Iranian personality in its cultural resources. In 1969, the year that Al-e Ahmad died (or was killed by the Shah’s intelligence service, SAVAK), his wife, Simin Daneshvar, published a remarkable novel, <i>Savushun</i>.<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en278" id="Ref-en278"><sup>53</sup></a> Set in the 1940s, the novel traces the tale of Zari, a woman who fought against imperialism, agrarian inequalities, and family suffocation. The novel is named after a folkloric hero (from the <i>Shahnama</i>) who is betrayed by his people and killed by foreigners. That was one part of Daneshvar’s reach into folklore; the other was in her search for national salvation. If the various social agents had been paralyzed by imperialism and autarky, Zari, like others, waited for the coming of a Mahdi, the last prophet. For people like Daneshvar and Al-e Ahmad, the new Mahdi would be a reconstructed people’s movement. In 1966, <?dp n="114" folio="93" ?> Forugh Farrokhzad evoked that longing in “Someone Who Is Not Like Anyone.”</div>

</div>
<div class="tx">The tragedy of this beautiful hunger is that it displaces the <i>work</i> that needs to be done for the creation of this new Mahdi onto destiny or fate. In 1968, Tomás Gutiérrez Alea released his masterful <i>Memories of Underdevelopment</i>. In the movie, Sergio Corrieri Hernández played the part of a desolate bourgeois who, despite his sympathies to radicalism, has a hard time finding himself in the revolution. Such was the dilemma of Farrokhzad, Daneshvar, Al-e Ahmad, and others. Corrieri had no such trouble. He continued to act, but also worked for almost two decades in El Teatro Escambray, a rural theater ensemble. He reached the Central Committee of the Cuban Communist Party and took over international solidarity work, at the same time as he worked among young theater activists to forge a new way to be Cuban. Corrieri, too, longed for the coming of a Mahdi called revolution, and he put his life behind the attempt to construct that someone.</div>
