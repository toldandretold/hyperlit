<b>BANDUNG</b>
<div class="tx1">In 1955, the island of Java bore the marks not only of its three-hundred-year colonial heritage but also its recent and victorious anticolonial struggle. The diverse island that is the heart of the Indonesia archipelago is home to a large number of coffee, tea, and quinine plantations—the main producers of wealth for the Dutch coffers. At one end, toward the west, sits the town of Bandung, the City of Flowers. Its tropical deco administrative buildings contrasted strongly with the shacks that housed its workforce, forming a cityscape of uneven hopes and aspirations. In the 1940s, the workers and peasants of the city and its hinterland rose in struggle alongside the <i>pemuda</i>, the youth activists. The cry of <i>Siaaaap</i> (Attention!) rang out in the streets of the city in opposition not only to the Japanese occupiers but also the British who had replaced them, and the Dutch who waited in the wings to reclaim the island. In March 1946, when it appeared as if the British would not allow the Indonesians their independence, half a million residents of Bandung abandoned the city en masse, as they set fire to warehouses, homes, and government offices.<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en72" id="Ref-en72"><sup>1</sup></a> This event produced an epic song:<div class="atx1"><div class="tx1">Hello-Hello Bandung <br/>The capital of Parahyangan [Province] <br/>Hello-Hello Bandung <br/>The city of remembrance. <br/>For a long time, <br/>I have not met you. <?dp n="53" folio="32" ?> <br/>Now, you are a Sea of Fire. <br/>Let’s take over again, <i>Bung</i> [comrade].<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en73" id="Ref-en73"><sup>2</sup></a></div>

<div class="tx">By 1955 the city had been repopulated, now largely by poor migrants who had been displaced by a rebellion led by the Darul Islam, an anticolonial force that had pledged to create an Islamic republic in Indonesia (it died out by the mid-1960s for lack of success).<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en74" id="Ref-en74"><sup>3</sup></a> And even repopulated, south Bandung remained scarred by the fire. The Indonesia government chose this city as the site for a meeting of twenty-nine representatives of newly sovereign Asian and African nations. This meeting brought Sauvy’s concept to life. Of course, the April 1955 meeting did not create the Third World out of whole cloth. It simply made manifest tendencies such as the relatively common social conditions of the colonized states and the nationalist movements that each of these states produced. The Bandung Conference was, for the leaders of these nationalist movements, also the culmination of a process that began at the 1927 Brussels gathering of the League against Imperialism. All this is true, but what is still important about Bandung is that it allowed these leaders to meet together, celebrate the demise of formal colonialism, and pledge themselves to some measure of joint struggle against the forces of imperialism. Despite the infighting, debates, strategic postures, and sighs of annoyance, Bandung produced something: a belief that <?dp n="54" folio="33" ?> two-thirds of the world’s people had the right to return to their own burned cities, cherish them, and rebuild them in their own image.</div>
<div class="tx">Taking the podium on the first day, Indonesia’s president Sukarno welcomed the changes wrought by anticolonialism over Asia and Africa:<div class="atx1"><div class="tx1">Irresistible forces have swept the two continents. The mental, spiritual and political face of the whole world has been changed and the process is still not complete. There are new conditions, new concepts, new problems, new ideals abroad in the world. Hurricanes of national awakening and reawakening have swept over the land, shaking it, changing it, changing it for the better.<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en75" id="Ref-en75"><sup>4</sup></a></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="tx">A vast section of the world that had once bowed before the might of Europe now stood at the threshold of another destiny. Indeed, the freedom attained by the new nations seemed unimaginable just a few years ago. When Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi’s Indian National Congress declared itself for Purna Swaraj or Complete Independence in 1929, many felt that the step had been premature, that neither would Britain allow such a caesura, nor could India survive on its own. Nevertheless, Nehru, then the president of the congress, the leading arm of the anticolonial struggle in India, told delegates gathered in Lahore in 1929, “We stand today for the fullest freedom of India. Today or tomorrow, we may not be strong enough to assert our will. We are very conscious of our weakness, and there is no boasting in us or pride of strength. But let no one, least of all England, mistake or underrate the meaning or strength of our resolve.”<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en76" id="Ref-en76"><sup>5</sup></a> The resolve eventually came for India (and Pakistan) in 1947, as it came for Indonesia and Vietnam in 1945, the Philippines in 1946, Burma, Ceylon, Korea, and Malaysia in 1948, and China in 1949. In 1951, Ghana gained substantial independence (formally declared in 1957), the same year that Libya gained freedom from Italy to join Liberia, Ethiopia, and Egypt as Africa’s independent states, while in 1956 the Sudan broke from its Anglo-Egyptian bondage (just as Ethiopia absorbed Eritrea). These are the countries that gathered at Bandung.</div>
<div class="tx">Little apart from their common colonial and anticolonial history united these nations. Sukarno, scion of a diverse people who lived across hundreds of dispersed islands, understood the limited basis for unity among those who came to Bandung. But if a nation-state could be made of Indonesia, why could a transnational unity not be fashioned out of the Bandung nations? “Conflict comes not from variety of skins, nor from variety of religion,” Sukarno announced, “but from variety of <?dp n="55" folio="34" ?> desires.” A unity of desire forged out of struggle and organized into a common platform could undermine the social differences. “We are united by a common detestation of colonialism in whatever form it appears. We are united by a common detestation of racialism. And we are united by a common determination to preserve and stabilize peace in the world.”<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en77" id="Ref-en77"><sup>6</sup></a> These would be the elements for the Third World’s unity.</div>
<div class="tx">Unity for the people of the Third World came from a political position against colonialism and imperialism, not from any intrinsic cultural or racial commonalities. If you fought against colonialism and stood against imperialism, then you were part of the Third World. Sukarno’s views found common currency among most of the delegates to the Bandung meeting, whether of the Left (China), the center (India and Burma), or the Right (Turkey and the Philippines). When Sukarno argued that colonialism may have ended its formal phase, but that imperialism still lingered, he echoed the views of many of the Third World’s leaders as well as its people, who suffered daily from “underdevelopment.” Colonialism no longer came in sola topees but had “its modern dress, in the form of economic control, intellectual control.... It does not give up its loot easily.” To eradicate it, Sukarno urged the delegates and their populations to stand united as a Third World against imperialism. But what can this Third World do, given that its “economic strength is dispersed and slight,” and that without the “serried ranks of jet bombers,” the Third World “cannot indulge in power politics”?<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en78" id="Ref-en78"><sup>7</sup></a> What is left for this Third World on a planet where the atom bomb and the dollar determined the course of human history? What is left for a region that contained two thousand million people?<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en79" id="Ref-en79"><sup>8</sup></a> “We can inject the voice of reason into world affairs. We can mobilize all the spiritual, all the moral, all the political strength of Asia and Africa on the side of peace.”<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en80" id="Ref-en80"><sup>9</sup></a></div>
<div class="tx">Sukarno’s speech was the most powerful brief for Third World unity, which is why it is the best-known statement from the Bandung meeting.<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en81" id="Ref-en81"><sup>10</sup></a> Born in 1901, Sukarno came from the same social position as many of the important Third World leaders. From a family of lesser nobility, Sukarno’s father became swept up in the fervor of patriotism. He renamed his son after a figure from the Sanskrit epic <i>Mahabharata</i>, Karna, who is known to be honest and fearless.<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en82" id="Ref-en82"><sup>11</sup></a> Sukarno studied in European institutions (in Surabaja and Bandung) and trained to be an engineer, but harbored an ambition for Indonesian independence. This combination of being from the petty nobility or the emergent middle class as well as open to the type of educational advantages of European colonialism produced a series of leaders such as Nehru, Sukarno, U Nu of Burma, and the large <?dp n="56" folio="35" ?> number of <i>ilustrados</i> or “enlightened ones” of the Philippines.<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en83" id="Ref-en83"><sup>12</sup></a> As he finished his engineering studies, Sukarno began to publish <i>Indonesia Muda</i> (<i>Young Indonesia</i>), the journal of the Bandung Study Club. It was in this periodical that he first articulated his vision of a united front between all the patriotic forces against European colonialism. In Indonesia, the Marxists, the Islamists, and the nationalists formed the main opponents of Dutch rule, and Sukarno argued that all three must consider nationalism to be “as broad as the air” in a manner similar to the Congress Party in India and the Kuomintang in China. As he described this vision, the Communist Party (PKI) led a putsch, which failed and led to its repression. To take advantage of the energy produced by the PKI-led mass revolt from late 1926 to early 1927, Sukarno and his circle founded the Partai Nasional Indonesia (PNI).</div>
<div class="tx">The PNI, like the Congress Party and the Kuomintang, had a grab bag ideology, rooted in an anticolonial ethos, but in favor of a vague nationalism that attracted all social classes. The middle class came on board because many of them had been discriminated against in terms of administrative jobs and humiliated by the colonial hierarchy. Already veterans in the struggle for justice, the working class and the peasantry would gradually move to the PNI as it became central to the freedom struggle. Unlike the Congress Party in India that had became a mass movement by the 1920s through the creative campaigns led by Gandhi and unlike the Vietnamese Communist Party whose mass base emerged through diligent organizational work led by Ho Chi Minh, the PNI looked very much like other urban, middle-class anticolonial organizations in places as diverse as Peru and the Gold Coast—it developed out of an idea and reflected the views of a narrow stratum, but its platform would soon be adopted by many beyond its original circle. The educated youth would do the most work for the PNI and the organizations that shared its class origins. The Indonesian Youth Congress carried the struggle to the masses and provided many of the foot soldiers of the “noncooperation” struggle (a concept that Sukarno borrowed from Gandhi).<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en84" id="Ref-en84"><sup>13</sup></a></div>
<div class="tx">Frustrated by Sukarno’s actions, the Dutch administration arrested him in 1931 and held him until the Japanese invasion of the archipelago in 1942. When the Japanese took power, Sukarno worked with them, but not as their shill; he used every opportunity he could get to promote nationalist ideas, so that as the historian George Kahin notes, his speeches on the radio “were full of subtleties and double talk which generally passed over the head of the Japanese monitors but were meaningful to the population.”<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en85" id="Ref-en85"><sup>14</sup></a> On August 17, 1945, two days after the Japanese <?dp n="57" folio="36" ?> surrender, Sukarno (and his associate Hatta) declared independence for Indonesia—a move delayed by the entry of British troops who had come to restore the islands to the Dutch. Sukarno still had little mass base, and his declaration was sheer bravado. The Indonesian people backed him despite their shallow knowledge of his program, and he won. The fires of Bandung raged because people now believed that colonialism had ended. European rule no longer had any legitimacy. In 1949, Indonesia won its formal freedom.</div>
<div class="tx">Sukarno, like Nehru and other such nationalist leaders, came to the forefront of an upsurge against colonial power, without a clear agenda for the social development of their people. What was clear, however, was that they rode the wave produced by the actions of many small, local organizations—such as merchants forums, the PNI, religious organizations, and youth groups. Sukarno stood for freedom and justice, but not necessarily for a general revolution against the old social classes (such as the rural landed gentry, merchants, and others)—hence, the complicity of the Dutch and the PNI in the crackdown on the 1948 Communist rebellion in Madiun (which led to the execution and incarceration of scores of PKI cadre, and the suppression of the PKI in 1951–52, when the government arrested fifteen thousand party members). <a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en86" id="Ref-en86"><sup>15</sup></a> Sukarno did put money into education and state industries, drawing some of the agenda from the Communists, who continued to recruit a mass party (by 1965, the PKI numbered three and a half million cadre and twenty million members in mass organizations). In 1965, at his last Independence Day ceremony before a U.S.-backed coup ejected him, Sukarno stated, “We are now fostering an anti-imperialist axis—the Jakarta-Phnom Penh-Hanoi-Peking-Pyongyang axis.”<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en87" id="Ref-en87"><sup>16</sup></a> He had moved closer to the Communists than he would have imagined when he first entered politics.</div>
<div class="tx">But Sukarno did not represent all the voices in Bandung.</div>
<div class="tx">Communist China tore through the conference led by the ebullient personality of Zhou En-lai, whose legendary history and feverish attempts to befriend all had endeared him to most of the delegates.<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en88" id="Ref-en88"><sup>17</sup></a> Zhou had a vigorous schedule. Not only did Nehru guide him around and introduce him to those who already respected the Indian political leader but Zhou himself addressed as many sessions as possible and met almost all the delegates. Tea with the “centrists” Nehru and U Nu would be followed by tea with “rightists” such as Carlos Romulo of the Philippines and John Kotelawala of Ceylon (where Zhou met Afghanistan’s Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Sardar Mohammed Naim). Finally, <?dp n="58" folio="37" ?> Zhou and the Chinese delegation hosted a banquet attended by the major powers, but also the Arab states (represented by Crown Prince Faysal of Saudi Arabia, Seifel Islam Hassan of Yemen, Walid Salah of Jordan, Sami Solh of Lebanon, Mahmud Muntasser of Libya, and Ismail el Azhari of Sudan).</div>
<div class="tx">Zhou took a conciliatory tone toward the nationalist rhetoric of the conference and even begged those leaders who had a religious orientation to be tolerant toward his atheism.<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en89" id="Ref-en89"><sup>18</sup></a> The pacific approach by the Chinese delegation reflected the general Chinese Communist orientation toward foreign and domestic policy in that brief period from the 1940s until the early rumbles of the Cultural Revolution in the 1960s.<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en90" id="Ref-en90"><sup>19</sup></a> Right after 1949, when the Chinese Communists came to power, they cultivated a “democratic coalition” of peasants, workers, and intellectuals to strengthen and broaden their support and power base (Mao Tse-tung encouraged the Communists on this line with the slogan “Don’t hit out in too many directions”).</div>
<div class="tx">If the Communists within China found alliances among the peasantry and some fractions of the middle class, they had a harder time on the international stage. The clash with the Soviet Union from the 1930s onward continued after 1949, and intensified after the death of Joseph Stalin in 1953. The Sino-Soviet divide isolated China on a world stage otherwise predisposed to shun Communists. The United States rattled its sabers across the Sea of China over Formosa (later Taiwan) and Korea. In late 1950, the Chinese government acted impetuously to defend the Korean people by sending its troops across the Yalu River into the conflict on the peninsula. The USSR had discouraged this, mainly because it had invested itself in détente with the First World. China rejected the “camp” divisions of the Cold War, and found itself isolated from its natural ally in the USSR, and later the Warsaw Pact. China was entirely encircled by hostile powers—the USSR to the north and west, and the U.S.-initiated military pacts on either end. In addition, there was no one to argue China’s case at the United Nations because its seat was held by the government of Formosa. That the Chinese Communists resisted the idea that the darker nations should be divided into the spheres of influence of the two powers made it a principled ally of the Third World. China, it seemed to say, stood for independence and self-determination, not détente and division. Apart from principles alone, the Third World had something tangible to give China: however different in orientation, Bandung provided the terrain to end China’s isolation from world opinion and support.</div>
<?dp n="59" folio="38" ?><div class="tx">Of the twenty-nine states at the Bandung Conference, six important delegates had recently made military-economic arrangements with the United States and Britain. In 1954, Pakistan, the Philippines, and Thailand joined with New Zealand, Australia, France, Britain, and the United States to form the South East Asian Treaty Organization (SEATO, also known as the Manila Pact), while Iran, Iraq, Pakistan again, and Turkey joined with Britain and the United States to create the Central Treaty Organization (also known as the Baghdad Pact). At Bandung, the Pakistani, Thai, and Filipino delegates defended these pacts on the ground that they protected the “small or weak nations” from domestic and international Communism. As Romulo put it, “The empires of yesterday on which it used to be said the sun never set are departing one by one from Asia. What we fear now is the new empire of communism on which we know the sun never rises.”<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en91" id="Ref-en91"><sup>20</sup></a> Mohammed Ali of Pakistan also defended the pacts on the basis of the “right to self-defense, exercised singly or collectively” because of what he called “new and more invidious forms of imperialism that masquerade in the guise of ‘liberation.’ ”<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en92" id="Ref-en92"><sup>21</sup></a> The two major papers on the two sides of the Atlantic, the <i>New York Times</i> and the London <i>Times</i>, gave the speeches of Ali, Romulo, and Kotelawala a great deal of space. The U.S. paper cheered these three leaders, and found it “gratifying to the West to hear a strong championship of liberty of thought and action,” and see them put colonialism “into the right perspective,” which is to move the blame from European and U.S. imperialism to communism.<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en93" id="Ref-en93"><sup>22</sup></a></div>
<div class="tx">The pro–First World states at Bandung shared at least one thing in common: they were ruled by weak national bourgeoisies that had militant mass movements within which threatened their own legitimacy and power. The Filipino regime of Manuel Roxas and later Ramon Magsaysay, under whom Romulo served, was challenged by the Huk Rebellion of 1946–54, a mass uprising that took up arms against the new government and its U.S. backers. With arms from Truman, Magsaysay’s military dispatched the rebels just before the powers gathered in Manila to sign the SEATO treaty.<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en94" id="Ref-en94"><sup>23</sup></a> Thailand had reason to fear a Communist rebellion, for its own undemocratic regime had been challenged from within and its region had been rocked by a popular Communist insurgency in Malaysia that ran from 1948 to 1960, only to be suppressed by an aggressive British carpet-bombing campaign.<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en95" id="Ref-en95"><sup>24</sup></a> In 1951, the three-year-old Pakistani Communist Party joined with anti-imperialist officers in a failed coup that led to the party’s suppression (by 1954, it moved underground). Iraq and Iran, too, had strong left parties that <?dp n="60" folio="39" ?> offered an alternative to the landed leadership which had taken power after the collapse of the Ottoman Empire in the region. Indeed, Iraq at this time had the largest Communist Party in the Arab lands. This pressure conjoined with the USSR to the north led many of these regimes to seek shelter under the military umbrella of the United States.</div>
<div class="tx">The blocs had much more than a military function because they worked to transform the social and political system of the states that yoked their destiny to the United States.<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en96" id="Ref-en96"><sup>25</sup></a> The “security zone” created by the United States gave many of these states a security guarantee from Washington, DC, for a price: the creation of U.S. military bases in these countries, and the opening up of their markets to U.S. firms. As the U.S. journalist I.F. Stone observed, “Pax Americana is the internationalism of Standard Oil, Chase Manhattan, and the Pentagon.”<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en97" id="Ref-en97"><sup>26</sup></a> By this analysis, the independence of the newly liberated parts of the world was being curtailed not just by the military alliances but more important by the further integration of places like the Philippines, Pakistan, and Turkey into the economic plans of the First World’s global corporations as well as the dynamic of “free market” capitalism that benefited these economic behemoths.</div>
<div class="tx">When Romulo gave the Weil Lecture on American Citizenship at the University of North Carolina, and when he wrote in the <i>New York Times Magazine</i>, shortly after Bandung, he used both forums to offer a stern rebuke of U.S. economic policy. There is a Marshall Plan for Europe, he told his audience in Chapel Hill, but only “chicken feed” for Asia. “What is worse,” he stated in the <i>Times</i>, “it comes with the accompaniment of senatorial lectures on how we must be grateful and how imperative it is for us to realize the advantages of the American way of life. And so on. Must Asia and Africa be content with crumbs and must we be told what a great favor is being conferred on us?”<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en98" id="Ref-en98"><sup>27</sup></a> Not only does the U.S. government provide meager aid, and not only does it favor its global corporations to ride rampant on the Third World, but it disfigures the global agricultural markets with its “dumping of American surplus products in Asia, such as rice.” This has “done irreparable harm to surplus-rice producing countries like Thailand.”<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en99" id="Ref-en99"><sup>28</sup></a> Even allies like the Philippines could not easily stomach the economic arrangements of Pax Americana.</div>
<div class="tx">The heart of the Third World was in the hands of Sukarno, Nehru, U Nu, and Nasser. All four of them chided their colleagues for their formal association with the two major powers; they spoke against pacts and allegiances that divided the world into the toxic Cold War. On <?dp n="61" folio="40" ?> September 29, 1954, Nehru had explained his position on military pacts at length before the Indian house of the people. India had been invited to join the Manila Pact, yet it had refused principally because the Indian government felt that the military pact was not so much a defensive treaty but a way for the major powers to exercise their influence. Why are Britain and the United States part of the “defensive area” of Southeast Asia, Nehru asked? It is not because they are part of the region but because they want to use SEATO to exercise their influence on the domestic and international relations of the pact countries. The “Manila Treaty is inclined dangerously in the direction of the spheres of influence to be exercised by powerful countries. After all, it is the big and powerful countries that will decide matters and not the two or three weak and small Asian countries that may be allied to them.” <a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en100" id="Ref-en100"><sup>29</sup></a> At Bandung, Nehru bore the brunt of the objections from more than half the delegates whose countries had joined one or more pacts. He soldiered on, joined by the Burmese, the Indonesians, the Egyptians, the Syrians, the Cambodians, the North Vietnamese, the Laotians, and the representatives of the Gold Coast and Yemen. “I submit to you,” he told the political committee at Bandung, “every pact has brought insecurity and not security to the countries which have entered into them. They have brought the danger of atomic bombs and the rest of it nearer to them than would have been the case otherwise.”<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en101" id="Ref-en101"><sup>30</sup></a></div>
<div class="tx">Not only were there at least three different centers of opinion at Bandung but there were also areas of Africa and Asia that had not been invited to the conference. As the publisher of the <i>New York Times</i> noted, “The meeting is not truly regional. Australia and New Zealand are, for example, more intimately concerned with its problems than is the Gold Coast. Nationalist China, the two Koreas, Israel and South Africa have been excluded.”<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en102" id="Ref-en102"><sup>31</sup></a> The same paper had no problem with the involvement of the United States and Britain in the regional pacts centered around Manila and Baghdad, perhaps because these two states already had a presumptive global role, whereas the darker nations should aspire to nothing more than a strictly local ambit. Kotelawala offered the pithiest reason for the exclusion of the republic of South Africa: “I can’t go there. Why in the devil should I invite them?”<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en103" id="Ref-en103"><sup>32</sup></a> Apartheid disqualified South Africa’s government from fellowship with the nascent Third World. Israel suffered the same fate as Formosa because both had the reputation of being too beholden to the colonial powers and insufficiently driven by the dynamic of anticolonialism.<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en104" id="Ref-en104"><sup>33</sup></a> Nevertheless, other pro-American states did get invited to and participated fully in <?dp n="62" folio="41" ?> Bandung: Ceylon (Sri Lanka), Iran, Iraq, Japan, Jordan, Pakistan, the Philippines, Saudi Arabia, and South Vietnam. Bandung also left out the two Koreas, which had recently been in conflict, and all the Soviet Central Asian republics and Outer Mongolia, because they had an intimate relationship with Moscow.</div>
<div class="tx">What did Bandung accomplish? At Bandung, the representatives of the formerly colonized countries signaled their refusal to take orders from their former colonial masters; they demonstrated their ability to discuss international problems and offer combined notes on them. In this regard, Bandung did create the format for what would eventually become the Afro-Asian and then Afro-Asian–Latin American group in the United Nations. A fragment of this group (twelve Arab-Asian states) offered their first such feint at the United Nations during the 1949 debate over the state of the Italian empire, and then, in force in December 1950, to insist that the major powers (particularly the United States) agree to a ceasefire in Korea.<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en105" id="Ref-en105"><sup>34</sup></a> Nehru, in the Indian Parliament after Bandung, underscored the importance of the United Nations after the conference: “We believe that from Bandung our great organization, the United Nations, has derived strength. This means in turn that Asia and Africa must play an increasing role in the conduct and destiny of the world organization.”<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en106" id="Ref-en106"><sup>35</sup></a> The final communiqué at Bandung demanded that the United Nations admit all those formerly colonized states, such as Libya and Vietnam, then denied admission into its body (“For effective cooperation for world peace, membership in the United Nations should be universal”).<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en107" id="Ref-en107"><sup>36</sup></a> The creation of this UN bloc over time would be the most important accomplishment of Bandung—notably because this bloc would, alongside the socialist one, be the bulwark against “dollar imperialism” and offer an alternative model for development.</div>
<div class="tx">Bandung is best remembered, among those who have any memory of it, as one of the milestones of the peace movement. Whatever the orientation of the states, they agreed that world peace required disarmament. During Europe’s domestic era of relative peace (1815–1914), the part of the planet under its control grew from a third to 85 percent, and Europe’s military technology exerted itself on much of this newly conquered terrain. From the 1856 bombardment of Canton by British forces to the 1913 Spanish aerial bombardment of Morocco, the colonized world already knew what the weapons of mass destruction could do. The colonized also knew how such weapons cultivated a detached sadism among those who had their fingers on the trigger. English author R.P. Hearne, who had written a children’s book called <i>The Romance of<?dp n="63" folio="42" ?>  the Airplane</i>, wrote in <i>Airships in Peace and War</i> (1910), “In savage lands the moral effect of such an instrument of war [the air bomber] is impossible to conceive. The appearance of the airship would strike terror into the tribes,” for these planes can deliver “sharp, severe and terrible punishment,” and save “the awful waste of life occasioned to white troops by expeditionary work.”<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en108" id="Ref-en108"><sup>37</sup></a> Hearne’s thoughts are not idle, for aerial bombardment had become standard policy whether by the Italians in North Africa, the British in India and Iraq, the Americans in Nicaragua, or the Spanish in the Basque country or Morocco.</div>
<div class="tx">The racist disregard for human life occasioned a long discussion at Bandung on disarmament. In the conference communiqué, the delegates argued that the Third World had to seize the reins of the horses of the apocalypse. The Third World had a “duty toward humanity and civilization to proclaim their support for disarmament.”<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en109" id="Ref-en109"><sup>38</sup></a> As the nuclear powers dithered over talks, the Third World called on the United Nations to insist on dialogue and the creation of a regime to monitor arms control. The Disarmament Sub-Committee of the United Nations had been formed as a result of Indian (and Third World) initiative in the General Assembly in 1953, to “lift from the peoples of the world [the] burden and [the] fear [of annihilation], and thus to liberate new energies and resources for positive programmes of reconstruction and development.” <a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en110" id="Ref-en110"><sup>39</sup></a> When the United Nations finally created the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in 1957, its charter followed that of the final communiqué at Bandung, which asked the powers to “bring about the regulation, limitation, control and reduction of all armed forces and armaments, including the prohibition of the production, experimentation and use of all weapons of mass destruction, and to establish effective international controls to this end.”<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en111" id="Ref-en111"><sup>40</sup></a> The IAEA, in other words, is a child of Bandung.<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en112" id="Ref-en112"><sup>41</sup></a></div>
<div class="tx">None of the flamboyance of the delegates on nuclear war is exaggerated. The United States had tested nuclear devices in 1945, and used them on two Japanese cities; the USSR had tested them in 1949, and the United Kingdom had done so in 1952. Besides that, the use of massive aerial bombardment over Japan and Germany as well as elsewhere had created a world marked by the expectation of eventual annihilation. The Bandung states not only confessed to being outgunned in any future conflict but also pleaded for the sanity of disarmament. The 1952 UN Disarmament Commission did not allay many fears, because most people knew that the United States came to the table to undermine Soviet claims, that the First World had no desire to cut back on its military <?dp n="64" folio="43" ?> prowess; indeed, in November of that year, the United States exploded its first thermonuclear device and further accelerated the arms race.<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en113" id="Ref-en113"><sup>42</sup></a></div>
<div class="tx">That did not stop the Third World, which, led by India, proposed a four-point plan for disarmament to the United Nations in 1956. As a first step, the two major nuclear powers (the United States and the USSR) would have to suspend their experimental explosions. Second, the two powers should dismantle a few bombs to begin a process of total disarmament of nuclear weapons. The two powers should then come to the UN General Assembly and publicly declare their renunciation of nuclear weapons. Finally, all countries must publish their military budgets so as to have transparency in this great waste of social labor.</div>
<div class="tx">The struggle against colonialism had been both bloody and brutal, and the people of the Bandung states had lost lives even as they gained homelands. They knew the cost of war as much as anyone else, but more important, they had experienced the power of nonviolence to help shape the world. The obvious leader here was India, where the freedom movement had been shaped since the mid-1910s by ahimsa, mass nonviolent civil disobedience. Even those who had once taken to the bomb, such as the revolutionary Bhagat Singh, came to realize the power of nonviolence, as in his 1930 statement, “Use of force justifiable when resorted to as a matter of terrible necessity. Non-violence as policy indispensable for all mass movements.”<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en114" id="Ref-en114"><sup>43</sup></a> That India and Ghana, among others, could emerge out of colonialism by the use of nonviolence had an impact at Bandung—although the Third World had not yet been fully marked by the development of the armed nationalist movements in Algeria and Cuba, both of which were liberated by the gun. Until Bandung, at any rate, nonviolence had a prestige, and for Nehru to propagate the “Five Principles of Peaceful Co-Existence” had a gravity that might not have been allowed by the Bandung powers without India’s ability to exert pain and social costs on the British Empire.</div>
<div class="tx">The Third World, however, remained vulnerable on at least two counts. The Bandung states continued to hoard weapons—a fact that led many to charge them with hypocrisy. Both India and Pakistan had already embarked on a catastrophic arms race after their first war in 1947–48. Regional conflicts and invasions by imperialist powers (such as the Anglo-French-Israeli assault on Egypt in 1956) made the need for “defense” second nature in these states. While the Bandung states made various shades of a strategic decision to maintain armies, they proposed a planetary transformation in the way states dealt with each other—indeed, they demanded that the major powers take the lead to give teeth <?dp n="65" folio="44" ?> to the United Nations’s role as peacemaker, to allow fellowship to be the basis for interstate relations rather than détente.<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en115" id="Ref-en115"><sup>44</sup></a> Second, one of the Bandung powers, China, had decided in 1955 (during the Taiwan Strait crisis) to develop nuclear weapons. Chairman Mao had once called nuclear weapons a “paper tiger,” but now it seemed as if China wanted one of its own. The other Bandung states made many attempts to prevent China from its pact with the atom, but they failed. The pursuit went all the way to the eve of China’s test explosion in 1964, as the delegates at the second Conference of Non-Aligned States in Cairo tried to “persuade China to desist from developing nuclear weapons.”<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en116" id="Ref-en116"><sup>45</sup></a> The Chinese turn to the bomb and the persistence of conflict between the Bandung states significantly undermined the otherwise-strong moral challenge posed by the Third World to the radioactive Cold War.</div>
<div class="tx">Bandung’s final communiqué did not open with disarmament or colonialism but with “economic cooperation.” Amid the crucial points on bilateral trade and liaisons from one state to another, the points showed a determined effort by the Bandung states to stave off the imperialist pressure brought on them not so much by direct colonialism but by finance capital and the comparative advantages given to the First World by the legacy of colonialism. The communiqué called for the creation of a Special UN Fund for Economic Development (SUNFED) and for an International Finance Corporation to ensure the regulation of predatory capital flows. It envisaged the creation of a UN Permanent Advisory Commission on International Commodity Trade and encouraged its peers to diversify their export trade. Under colonial conditions, the darker nations had been reduced to being providers of raw materials and consumers of manufactured goods produced in Europe and the United States. The Bandung proposals called for the formerly colonized states to diversify their economic base, develop indigenous manufacturing capacity, and thereby break the colonial chain. SUNFED and the other UN bodies had been drafted with the view to enable these developments.</div>
<div class="tx">These moderate proposals came after a preamble written to settle any fears among international financiers that the Third World had “gone socialist,” and yet, these proposals chilled the financial press in Europe and the United States. But even the most anticommunist among the Bandung delegates supported the idea of some autarky for the Third World from the immense power of the First World. When Romulo left the Bretton Woods Conference that set up the international financial system, he did so in anger at the manner in which the First World states “had already <?dp n="66" folio="45" ?> set themselves up to be the ones to decide what the economic pattern of the postwar world should be.”<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en117" id="Ref-en117"><sup>46</sup></a> The near-universal acclaim for the formation of the UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) in 1964 is evidence of the widespread agreement within the Third World on some anti-imperialist strategy for economic development.</div>
<div class="tx">The most powerful agreement at Bandung came over “cultural cooperation.” The lack of agreement on the nature of the global political economy resulted in a weak combined position. Progressive nation-alisms drew from the class interests of those who predominated in their various societies. What united these various classes, however, was a forthright condemnation of the indignity of imperialism’s cultural chauvinism. The unity on this theme far exceeded that on the political economy. For the decade before Bandung, UNESCO had sponsored a crucial study of racism and racial attitudes in different cultural traditions. The work produced a series of important monographs, including works by the anthropologist Claude Lévi-Strauss and the psychologist Marie Jahoda. UNESCO’s work had grown from the post-Holocaust insight that race is not only a biological fiction but that its mobilization in world history had torn people asunder. At Bandung, the twenty-nine new states condemned “racialism as a means of cultural suppression.” Imperial racism, they argued, “not only prevents cultural cooperation but also suppresses the national cultures of the people.”<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en118" id="Ref-en118"><sup>47</sup></a> Empires generally attempt to direct the cultural history of a people—to set one community against another (divide and rule), adopt one group as the leader above the rest, or else disdain the cultural traditions of a region and propose its substitution by the empire’s own cultural traditions, at least for a select few. The Bandung twenty-nine demanded an end to this use of cultural richness for purposes of domination. But they went further, enjoining the world to learn about each other’s cultures, to demand that the darker nations not only find out about European culture but that each of the twenty-nine and beyond learn about everyone’s cultural history. The communiqué directed the countries toward “the acquisition of knowledge of each other’s country, mutual cultural exchange, and exchange of information.” This was not to be only in the arts but in all aspects of culture, including science and technology.<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en119" id="Ref-en119"><sup>48</sup></a></div>
<div class="tx">From Belgrade to Tokyo, from Cairo to Dar es Salaam, politicians and intellectuals began to speak of the “Bandung Spirit.” What they meant was simple: that the colonized world had now emerged to claim its space in world affairs, not just as an adjunct of the First or Second Worlds, but as a player in its own right. Furthermore, the Bandung <?dp n="67" folio="46" ?> Spirit was a refusal of both economic subordination and cultural suppression—two of the major policies of imperialism. The audacity of Bandung produced its own image.</div>
<div class="tx">Nowhere was the impact felt strongest than in Moscow, among the newly installed leaders who took charge after the 1953 death of Stalin. Nikita Khrushchev and Nicolay Aleksandrovich Bulganin went on a major world tour, beginning in Yugoslavia, then going to India and Burma. Nehru and U Nu visited Moscow, and Nasser went to Yugoslavia—all this as the USSR increased its economic aid to the newly aggressive national bourgeois states of Africa and Asia. The visit of the Soviet leaders to Marshal Tito in Yugoslavia sent a signal that they had decided to change their tenor on the new nations.<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en120" id="Ref-en120"><sup>49</sup></a> Tito had already become close to many of the Bandung twenty-nine states, having visited India, Burma, Egypt, and Ethiopia. On Belgrade radio at the end of the conference, Tito offered his verdict: “The number of Asiatic and African countries participating in the conference, and the huge interest in the conference in Asia and Africa show that a crossroads of history has been reached in the sense that those peoples are determined to decide their own fate as far as possible.”<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en121" id="Ref-en121"><sup>50</sup></a> Tito would soon join the main players in the Third World to help decide this fate. In the joint declaration of the Soviets and the Yugoslavians on June 2, 1955, they affirmed the concept of the Third World, welcomed the successful conclusion of the Bandung Conference, and noted that the conference had made a significant advance for the cause of world peace.<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en122" id="Ref-en122"><sup>51</sup></a> Finally, the USSR allowed its allies, such as the Czech government, to sell arms to the Egyptians, and it too consolidated economic ties with the Bandung states.</div>
<div class="tx">Dramatically, in 1956, the twentieth Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) rejected its earlier two-camp theory of the world. The congress reiterated the position taken by Nehru and U Nu at Bandung, and by Nasser in Cairo. It noted that the camp theory provided a vision of the world that suggested that war was the only solution to the division, that across the abyss of the divide there could be no conversation and dialogue toward peace. For that reason, the congress adopted the notion of the “zone of peace,” to include all states that pledged themselves to a reduction of force on behalf of a peace agenda. The congress included in the zone of peace the socialist Second World and what it called “uncommitted states”—that is, the non-aligned Third World.<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en123" id="Ref-en123"><sup>52</sup></a></div>
<div class="tx">The Soviet motivations for this transformed role in world affairs are complex. Some argue that the new leadership of the CPSU had revised <?dp n="68" folio="47" ?> the previous commitment to the working class in the formerly colonized world and had now shifted its allegiance to the national bourgeoisie. The Soviet leadership, then, can be seen to be motivated by a desire to undo the postwar Soviet era of lax support for the nationalist movements, and therefore, the interest in expanding socialism by alliance rather than by social revolution. Others contend that the policy is motivated less by any general theory of world revolution, and more by the influence of the Chinese in the Third World. The USSR’s shift occurred, by this logic, more in the context of the growing Sino-Soviet split than in any ideological congruence with the Third World’s agenda.<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en124" id="Ref-en124"><sup>53</sup></a></div>
<div class="tx">If the proof of the pudding is in the eating, then the Soviet adoption of the idea of “non-alignment,” for whatever reason, tasted far better in the darker nations than the First World’s disdain for it. The newly installed British government of Anthony Eden showed open hostility to what it termed “neutralism.” Before Bandung, Eden, then foreign secretary, had urged his ambassadors in African and Asian countries that reviled Communism to send delegations to Indonesia with the purpose of putting up a show against the Chinese as well as to secure the formerly colonized world into a relationship with the First World.<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en125" id="Ref-en125"><sup>54</sup></a> Eden, who in 1938 had urged European powers to “effectively assert white-race authority in the Far East,” projected Britain’s hope for continued imperial power, even as it had already become an extension of the United States.<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en126" id="Ref-en126"><sup>55</sup></a> The Anglo-French invasion of Egypt in 1956 sealed the attitude of the Third World toward Britain, and even Ceylon (at Bandung, very pro–First World) joined the Burmese, Indonesians, and Indians in a November 12, 1956, condemnation of the assault.</div>
<div class="tx">The United States had an even more hostile attitude toward Bandung from the start. Indeed, when U.S. congressperson Adam Clayton Powell Jr. decided to attend the conference, the U.S. State Department not only tried to dissuade him but, as Powell told the press, advised him to “stay away from the U.S. Embassy and U.S. Ambassador Hugh S. Cummings Jr., because his association with the U.S. Embassy would give an official flavor to his presence.” Twenty-four hours after Powell arrived in Indonesia, however, he was asked by the State Department to go to the embassy because, as Powell put it, otherwise “Communist propaganda would say that the U.S. State Department was discriminating against a member of Congress because he is a Negro.” Powell refused to stay in the embassy, in protest. “This conference is not anti-white,” Powell told a news conference, “but it was anti-American foreign policy and it could become an anti-white movement unless a narrow-minded <?dp n="69" folio="48" ?> and unskilled American foreign policy is revised.” When he returned from Bandung, he could not get a meeting with the State Department, to which he had wanted to bring information about Saudi funds for rebels in North Africa.<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en127" id="Ref-en127"><sup>56</sup></a></div>
<div class="tx">After Bandung, the U.S. foreign policy establishment took a strong position against what it called “neutralism.” If a state decided to reject the two-camp approach of the United States and the USSR, then it was considered not to have a position of its own but to be neutral. In 1952, the U.S. planners had declared that neutralism was, according to Secretary of State Dean Acheson, “a shortcut to suicide,” and as conflict broke out in the neutral world, the USSR might “force the maximum number of non-Communist countries to pursue a neutral policy and to deny their resources to the principle Western powers.”<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en128" id="Ref-en128"><sup>57</sup></a> Ambassador Douglas MacArthur warned the United States that the Bandung Spirit might move Japan, a crucial geopolitical ally, to neutralism; the United States might lose its naval bases, and to prevent this, should treat Japan with more respect.<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en129" id="Ref-en129"><sup>58</sup></a> Following John Foster Dulles’s trip to East Asia for a SEATO meeting in 1958, the National Security Council deliberated and created a policy on mainland Southeast Asia. The document had to admit that the states in the region valued their independence above all else. The U.S. government, it noted, should “respect each country’s choice of national policy for preserving its independence, but make every effort to demonstrate the advantages of greater cooperation and closer alignment with the Free World, as well as the dangers of alignment with the Communist bloc.” The United States must tie these states into interdependence with its own economy (“Provide flexible economic and technical assistance as necessary to attain U.S. objectives”), its cultural institutions (“Make a special, sustained effort to help educate an expanding number of technically competent, pro-Western civilian and military leaders”), and its military power (“Maintain, in the general area of the Far East, U.S. forces adequate to exert a deterrent influence against Communist aggression, in conformity with current basic national security policy”).<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en130" id="Ref-en130"><sup>59</sup></a></div>
<div class="tx">The Third World dominated Bandung—that is, those powers that sought to create a non-aligned space from which to critique both the camp mentality and the rush to war won the battle to define Bandung’s legacy. Nasser, Nehru, and U Nu held the stage, not Romulo or Kotelawala. When U Nu traveled to Washington, DC, in 1955, he told the National Press Club that the UN Charter “is in effect one great mutual security pact.” Like Sukarno, U Nu came from a patriotic family of <?dp n="70" folio="49" ?> some means who had been swept up in the early struggles against British rule in Burma. If Sukarno made an attempt to align Marxism and nationalism with Islam, U Nu spent his youth trying to develop a Buddhist-Communist-nationalist synthesis. In the late 1930s, U Nu wrote an article titled “I Am a Marxist,” which asked, “How can people who starve and have to struggle from day to day for their very existence practice religion?” Such adverse conditions for Buddhism meant that “to help work for Marxism would be to repay our gratitude to Buddha for his suffering in all his aeons of existences for the benefit of mankind.”<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en131" id="Ref-en131"><sup>60</sup></a> U Nu played a leading role in the Anti-Fascist Organization created in 1944 to fight the Japanese Occupation, and it, along with General Aung San’s Burma National Army, became the vehicle for Burmese independence in 1948. A shaky relationship with the Burmese Communist Party, Communist China, and the U.S.-backed Kuomintang army that camped in large parts of Burma strengthened U Nu’s belief in a third way apart from the two-camp division of the world. The United Nations, in which the Third World played a unique role, would not be neutral in conflicts but would actively oppose them. “A divided world stands in greater need of a common forum to discuss differences than a world united,” U Nu said in Washington. For this reason, “I believe that if the United Nations did not exist today, the world would be working feverishly to establish it or something like it.”<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en132" id="Ref-en132"><sup>61</sup></a> The Third World and its vehicle, the United Nations, would not be neutral but would be actively against the polarization of the world.</div>
<div class="tx">On September 24, 1996, the UN secretary general Boutros Boutros-Ghali addressed a commemorative meeting of NAM. The seed of this movement had been sown at Bandung, Boutros-Ghali noted. “At Bandung, the birth of non-alignment was an act of stunning, world-transfixing boldness. Freed from the shackles of colonial oppression, the non-aligned stepped onto the international stage, raising a new voice for all the world to hear. International politics were fundamentally and forever transformed.” Boutros-Ghali’s enthusiasm was anachronistic. It would probably have made sense in the late 1950s, but by the 1990s, the Bandung Spirit had withered and the United Nations was not what it could have been. The Bandung Spirit could have changed international politics, and it certainly made every attempt to do so, but as we shall see below, it did fail. Its failure, however, cannot be sought in its ideals alone.</div>
<div class="tx">A young socialist trained in Paris, Boutros-Ghali returned to Cairo in 1949 to teach at its main university, edit a business weekly (<i>al-Ahram Iktisadi</i>), write a book on Afro-Asian political solidarity in 1969, and <?dp n="71" folio="50" ?> struggle in his early years to move Nasser’s Egypt toward justice and socialism. <a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en133" id="Ref-en133"><sup>62</sup></a> When Boutros-Ghali lectured in the law faculty, Nasser returned from Bandung and announced that the conference was “one of the two most important events of modern history” (the other was atomic energy).<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en134" id="Ref-en134"><sup>63</sup></a> Nasser’s enthusiasm for the Bandung Spirit was soured by the events of September 1955, when he linked Bandung to the Czech sales of arms to the Egyptians. For Nasser, the independence signaled at Bandung had to be protected by arms, an early perversion of the Third World agenda. Enthusiastically, Nasser wanted Bandung II to be held in Cairo, and even though it wasn’t, Cairo became the favored destination for a host of Afro-Asian solidarity meetings, from the Economic Conference in 1958 to the Medical Conference in 1964. But most important for a movement that had begun to be represented by men, the Bandung dynamic hosted the Afro-Asian Women’s Conference in Cairo in 1961.</div>
