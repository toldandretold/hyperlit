<b>ARUSHA</b>
<div class="tx1">In 1967, the Tanzanian president Julius Nyerere dropped a bombshell in a nondescript town that functioned as the gateway to eastern Africa’s most spectacular natural phenomenon. Founded in 1900 as a garrison town, Arusha is nestled at the base of Mount Meru and within sight of Mount Kilimanjaro and the Serengeti Plain. Here, at the executive committee of his Tanganyika African National Union (TANU), Nyerere unveiled what would become known as the Arusha Declaration. The opening line of the declaration, “The policy of TANU is to build a socialist state,” discomforted the British and Tanzanian owners and managers of most of the country’s resources (including the mines and the land). The announcement of socialism came alongside the recognition that its construction would not be easy in a formerly colonized state. Not only had the German and British colonial regimes stripped bare the economy of eastern Africa but they also left behind a state apparatus designed to exploit and not to liberate. The institutions of the state and the civil bureaucracy grew from a culture of imperial hierarchy, a value quite removed from the egalitarianism of national liberation (as illustrated by TANU’s Arusha Declaration and its 1971 <i>Mwongozo</i> or Leadership Code). Hemmed in by pressures from the advanced industrial states, the aristocratic rural classes, and the emergent mercantile classes, the new state had little time. Things had to change in a hurry. But socialism requires imagination and time. It cannot be made in a hurry. To create socialism in a hurry without mass support, and institutions that can channel this support, led many Third World states to disaster.</div>
<?dp n="213" folio="192" ?><div class="tx">The Arusha Declaration validated the twin principles of liberty and equality, individual rights and collective well-being.<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en571" id="Ref-en571"><sup>1</sup></a> The state had to eliminate poverty, ignorance, and disease. That was unimpeachable. But how should the state go about the process of elimination? What is the organizational form for the transformation of society? Should it be a centralized state alone, or does it need to cultivate democratic (perhaps local) institutions that could harness the energy, ingenuity, and enthusiasm of a population only recently freed? Tanzania’s population was mainly resident in rural areas and dependent on agriculture. Any institutional change needed to address agriculture and its role in the society as well as the world. After many fits and starts, the Nyerere regime adopted the idea of the socialist village (<i>ujamaa vijini</i> ) as the main organizational form for rural change. But the regime recognized that agrarian reform was insufficient. The national liberation regime had to solve some of the main demands of the population before its political capital ran out. In Tanzania, output in the subsistence sector was only 2 percent (while population growth was 3 percent). Even though Tanzania had a high rate of increase in food production, TANU inherited a crisis situation. Agriculture, in an industrial world, could not alone deal with the people’s aspirations and needs. The international terms of trade had a bias against agricultural commodities. Since rural Tanzania (like the rural areas of the world) required industrial products, its dwellers had a disadvantage. Tanzania needed to grow an industrial sector to produce capital goods (machinery, for example), and to refine and process agricultural (and mined) raw materials. The agricultural reforms therefore needed to come in the context of a wide economic reform.</div>
<div class="tx">This was a tall order for any society, and more so for one battered by colonial rule. Such changes required both political will and investment capital. Most national liberation regimes recognized the perils of foreign aid and commercial loans from banks in the advanced industrial states. These monies had the tendency to trap the postcolonial economy into a dependent relationship with the institutions of the First World (Soviet aid was limited as compared to what was available from Europe and the United States). “To burden the people with big loans,” noted the Arusha Declaration, “the repayment of which will be beyond their means, is not to help them but to make them suffer. It is even worse when the loans they are asked to repay have not benefited the majority of the people but have only benefited a small minority.”<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en572" id="Ref-en572"><sup>2</sup></a> Instead of foreign aid or commercial loans, the national liberation states developed a three-pronged approach to development: the nationalization of the commanding heights <?dp n="214" folio="193" ?> of the economy (finance, infrastructure, energy, crucial raw material extraction, and capital goods production), the development of the agricultural sector, and the encouragement of industrialization. The plan expected the capital for industrialization to come from the nationalization of finance and an increase in the agricultural surplus. Nationalization put financial decisions in the hands of the state rather than transnational corporations, and it arrested the hemorrhage of capital. Whatever funds could be assembled helped toward the main challenge before Tanzania: to kick-start the rural economy and create equality in rural areas. Given the limited time frame to engineer agricultural reform and industrial growth, the national liberation state acted fast. In the Arusha Declaration, Nyerere bemoaned the logic that one had to first build capitalism and then socialism, because the act of doing the former would produce social wealth, but it would also squelch the political dynamic of national liberation that afforded an opportunity for such social transformation. “The mistake we are making,” he wrote, “is to think that development begins with industries. It is a mistake because we do not have the means to establish many modern industries in our country.”<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en573" id="Ref-en573"><sup>3</sup></a> First agricultural change, and then industrial growth.</div>
<div class="tx">The Third World agenda, for states such as India and Egypt, was not socialist as much as welfarist. The state centralized and nationalized the commanding heights of the economy to ensure that its dominant classes gained some purchase on a complex international economy (which was at any rate weighted against them). These states were concerned for their citizens’ welfare, as we shall see below, but they did not pledge themselves to the creation of an egalitarian society. Tanzania under Nyerere’s TANU attempted something more than the welfarism of India and Egypt. The Arusha Declaration drew from the socialist experiments: there was an insistence that the state must create equity among the population, and that this equity needed to be crafted at the level of production and not simply consumption.</div>
<div class="tx">The main problem with the Arusha-TANU project, however, came not in its goals but in its implementation. Like most Third World nation-alisms, Arusha-TANU failed to differentiate the population. Since the bulk of Tanzania’s population lived in rural areas, the declaration called for the state to “pay heed to the peasant.” The policies it created targeted the landless peasantry, and among them the special role of women in agricultural production and reproduction.<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en574" id="Ref-en574"><sup>4</sup></a> What the Arusha-TANU strategy failed to delineate was how the mechanism for the delivery of its policies would utilize landless peasants, especially women. Instead, <?dp n="215" folio="194" ?> the state talked of the people, and yet it stood apart from them. TANU did not isolate special class allies among the peasantry and build institutions for them that would be the vehicle for social change. Rural trade unions for landless peasants were not formed in the service of either the 1967 ujamaa or the 1973–75 villagization programs. The state concentrated on the peasants and ignored the crucial role of organized labor in the “modern” sector (the dockworkers, postal workers, diamond miners, railway workers, sisal plantation workers, and others who led a series of strikes between 1958 and 1961 to win independence from Britain).<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en575" id="Ref-en575"><sup>5</sup></a> The TANU regime came to power, abolished the trade unions, and collected the unions’ personnel into one government-authorized union, the National Union of Tanganyika Workers (1964). The natural allies of a socialist experiment were marginalized. There was no well-developed strategy for how the state planned to build power for its ideas.<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en576" id="Ref-en576"><sup>6</sup></a> Instead, the state stood above the people, directing them, preaching “socialism from above.”<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en577" id="Ref-en577"><sup>7</sup></a></div>
<div class="tx">In 1961, Tanzania barely exported any industrial goods. Agriculture dominated the domestic economy, and agrarian commodities were the main export items. As world agricultural prices remained low and often fluctuate quite wildly, Tanzania’s economy malingered. To move to grow industries without capital, and with little accumulated capital from the centuries, would be a fool’s errand. Not only did the socialist government of Nyerere recognize this, but so too did the World Bank in an influential report.<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en578" id="Ref-en578"><sup>8</sup></a> The World Bank, along with Nyerere’s government, found that Tanzania’s social ecology did not have villages as much as dispersed homesteads.<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en579" id="Ref-en579"><sup>9</sup></a> A challenge to any administration would be to amalgamate the efforts of these individual units into something more economically productive. The German colonizers had formed villages to facilitate missionary work, but their failure had drawn the British to valorize the independence of the African yeoman.<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en580" id="Ref-en580"><sup>10</sup></a> The relatively low density of population allowed the countryside to remain outside the orbit of world trade. Now, with the plans for the new nations and the expectations of progress, the Nyerere government acted.</div>
<div class="tx">In the early 1960s, the national liberation state did not bother smallholders who grew crops for the subsistence economy. Their only intervention in this sector was to provide the smallholders with minor improvements in their farming techniques.<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en581" id="Ref-en581"><sup>11</sup></a> The dispersed peasantry that suffered in years of poor rainfall could be served with better irrigation systems. The state also provided smallholders with mechanized implements and seeds for cash crops to replace subsistence farming. The <?dp n="216" folio="195" ?> introduction of cash crops did not go down well with the farmers. The export (cash) crops required expensive fertilizers and seeds, all of which cost money up front. In case the export market failed them, the farmers were stuck without access to food. Cotton, coffee, and tobacco had volatile international prices, and the farmers resisted their cultivation in all kinds of ways.</div>
<div class="tx">When the government’s “improvement” scheme faltered, it tried a more radical approach called “transformation.” The regime encouraged peasants to move to experimental farms called “village settlements” where they worked cooperatively to increase, theoretically, the value of their efforts. On these farms, mechanical implements and fertilizers replaced manual labor (mainly the hand hoe). The people, in Nyerere’s terms, had to learn to live in “proper villages.”<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en582" id="Ref-en582"><sup>12</sup></a> Of the millions who lived in rural Tanzania, only 3,500 families moved to set up these village settlements, which had cost the government upward of two million pounds. The famous French agronomist and sometime UN Food and Agriculture Organization adviser René Dumont wrote a report in 1969 that came close to the government’s own view of the creation of villages: the scheme had produced appalling results, but it did “appear desirable, on condition that it did not cost too much.”<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en583" id="Ref-en583"><sup>13</sup></a> The Arusha Declaration took stock of the several failures in the agricultural policy and offered an aggressive defense of the regime’s strategy to grow the fields rather than build the factories. In the wake of the declaration, the regime announced not a withdrawal from village settlement but an expansion, now to be called the ujamaa program, with the total transformation of rural areas into socialist villages.</div>
<div class="tx">A few months after the Arusha Declaration, Nyerere’s regime decided that it had simply worked to promote small-scale capitalist agriculture rather than socialism.<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en584" id="Ref-en584"><sup>14</sup></a> The improvement of farm life without any attempt to transform the feudal relations between the farmers and their markets was insufficient. The communal ideas that Nyerere felt were inherent in peasant life and that predated capitalism were getting swept away with capitalist agriculture. Ujamaa was to craft a modern shell for this communal husk.<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en585" id="Ref-en585"><sup>15</sup></a> Nyerere’s regime called all peasants to move to ujamaa villages within the decade. The state resettled three million people, about 20 percent of Tanzania’s population. The resettled farmers lived together in a village and worked cooperatively on the outlying fields. They pooled their resources to buy any inputs, and they pooled their produce for the market. The ujamaa policy had two major flaws. First, while the collectivization radically transformed the social relations <?dp n="217" folio="196" ?> of the farmers with their market, Nyerere did not construct ujamaa as a means to refashion the gendered aspects of social power. For Nyerere, the community of the farmers “would be the traditional family group,” with all the implications of gendered power that this implied.<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en586" id="Ref-en586"><sup>16</sup></a></div>
<div class="tx">Second, the policy left the regime no time to persuade a peasantry that had to be coerced into villages under the government’s control. The government set in motion various “operations” to galvanize peasants to move to the villages (1971 Operation Dodoma, 1972 Operation Kogoma, and 1973 Operation Pwani). R.R. Matango described the chaos in his home district of Inchungu (Mara). “Many peasants in Inchungu were taken by surprise to see armed militiamen, climbing on top of their houses, taking away the thatch, in some cases the iron-sheets were torn off, doors and windows removed or smashed into pieces; houses pulled down in many cases.” The state militia destroyed the old villages and moved the villagers to new sites. “People rushed in panic to build temporary accommodations in unplanned village sites. The entire division was in motion. Moving, moving in panic to the unplanned villages. Thus creating new villages in areas which are not even surveyed, on water, on school or dispensary—virtually no facility to maintain the population there or any plans to bring any, but only to serve the purpose of moving into the Development Villages. This haphazard, skimble-skamble movement has created problems which need urgent government attention and resources.”<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en587" id="Ref-en587"><sup>17</sup></a> Without surveys, homes were built on fertile cotton soil or around areas where the land was without adequate irrigation. Socialism in a hurry in the Third World, in this manner, became undemocratic and authoritarian.</div>
<div class="tx">Tanzanian ujamaa is quite of a piece with a vast number of examples of Third World development or Third World socialism in a hurry. Most of the Third World states hurriedly built industrial factories and dams, cleared forests, and moved populations. This labor came for many reasons, of which the most important was to rapidly increase the productive capacity of the new nation, to make a Great Leap Forward into a moment of prosperity before the political capital of the liberation movements had been spent. Developed productive forces would generate the economic well-being that could only be created out of sacrifices demanded by political movements which had won political freedom from colonial rule or the rule of oligarchs. The intentions of the leadership, by all accounts, were not malevolent. Yet its modernist dream—to administer nature and society, and build vast industrial monuments without either a democratic governance structure or a mobilized population—led to the worst excesses of commandism and bureaucratism.<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en588" id="Ref-en588"><sup>18</sup></a> In India, in the period from <?dp n="218" folio="197" ?> the late 1940s to the late 1980s, the state displaced some 25 million people, while in the same period, the Chinese shifted 40 million people. These are the dramatic figures, because these states have substantial populations, but in small countries the percentage of the population that the state shifted by its bureaucratic commandism is staggering (in Tanzania, a fifth of the population was resettled).<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en589" id="Ref-en589"><sup>19</sup></a> The disregard for people’s desires and the cannibalization of the ecological lifeworld both turned masses of people away from the Third World project as well as destroyed the habitat for the creation of justice. The state acted above the people, without care to build allies among the peasantry and allow them to force change through their organizations.</div>
<div class="tx">The ujamaa program began with the assumption that the national liberation regime should create a democratic economy that worked in the interests of the vast mass of the people. Since most of the people in the formerly colonized world in general and in Tanzania in particular lived rural lives, Nyerere’s 1961 slogan resonated with them: “While other countries aim to reach the moon we must aim for the time being, at any rate, to reach the village.”<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en590" id="Ref-en590"><sup>20</sup></a> Whatever Nyerere’s intentions and those of the many Third World governments that had similar agricultural schemes (from Algeria to Burma, and on), the move to consolidate agriculture had the net effect of trying to <i>control</i> the peasantry, to agglomerate peasant production under the domination of the national liberation state.<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en591" id="Ref-en591"><sup>21</sup></a> Once collected, peasant production in the Third World would now be made subservient to the dynamics of world trade (and imperialism) rather than the subsistence needs of the localities that could have governed their development.<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en592" id="Ref-en592"><sup>22</sup></a> To render the relatively autonomous petty commodity sector subservient to the state, the regime abolished the marketing cooperative movement in 1975. Formed to gain better prices for agricultural produce (notably cotton), the movement brought some benefits to the peasantry. But the state decided to buy directly from the growers, often at prices set by the central government. Additionally, in 1972, the regime adopted the counsel of the U.S. consulting agency, McKinsey and Co., which advised it to replace the local government agencies with “development teams” that reported directly to central government ministries. These teams, wrote a scholar at the University of Dar es Salaam, “effectively replaced the local government system with an elaborate system of vertical information and planning flows centralized to the higher echelons of the government and party.”<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en593" id="Ref-en593"><sup>23</sup></a></div>
<div class="tx">The worst aspect of the Tanzanian and many Third World agricultural schemes is that because they worked in a hurry, and because they <?dp n="219" folio="198" ?> often had the view that the peasantry <i>should</i> simply follow rather than be guided by them, policies that might have been valuable corroded by the use of force. The Third World leadership in power seemed to follow Fyodor Dostoyevsky to the letter: “Well, then, eliminate the people, curtail them, force them to be silent. Because the European enlightenment is more important than people.” If the modern state used violence as principally an immanent condition to discourage popular uprisings and keep the people in line, in the context of Third World modernism and bureaucratism violence became a means to realize the agenda of the state. In a review of ujamaa that understood the value of its ideals, the agricultural economist Philip Raikes wrote, “The implementation of the policy evoked some of the more frightening recesses of the bureaucratic mind.”<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en594" id="Ref-en594"><sup>24</sup></a> Nyerere, in October 1967, understood that the ujamaa project as his regime constructed it would be implemented by force, and so he tried to see if his moral authority could turn the tide for persuasion. “We are not simply trying to organize increased production; we are trying to introduce a whole new way of life for the majority of our people. This can only be done once the people understand its purposes and voluntarily decide to participate.”<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en595" id="Ref-en595"><sup>25</sup></a> In these words, Nyerere suggested that the regime should allow the people to hear from the government and then “voluntarily” follow its opinions. But the words of one person are hardly able to ameliorate or even transform the policies of a regime, even in one that gave so much power to an individual. Nyerere’s policy had greater traction than his best intentions.<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en596" id="Ref-en596"><sup>26</sup></a> If the multitude that worked the land did not have a stake in it, then they would neither be motivated to increase its capacity nor would they benefit from it. Only compulsion motivated them to work hard.</div>
<div class="tx">People, because that is our wont, dissented in brave and innovative ways even when the state could neither provide avenues for nor tolerate dissent. The peasants of the Morogoro and Arusha regions ate the maize seeds rather than plant them, sold their subsidized fertilizers in the underground market, pretended not to understand instructions, tried to involve witchcraft against the local party officials, and organized demonstrations against villagization.<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en597" id="Ref-en597"><sup>27</sup></a> Elsewhere, people flocked to dam submergence sites and corralled them, or else struck against faster work rules in dangerous factories or mines. The level of dissent was matched by the rising tide of antilabor legislation and the violent reaction of the state. Police firings, mass arrests, assassinations of labor and people’s leaders—all this became commonplace in the public sphere of the Third World.</div>
<?dp n="220" folio="199" ?><div class="tx">Despite these major flaws, the Arusha experiment at the very least attempted to dethrone the powerful role played by the established social classes. Most of the darker nations tailored the Third World agenda to protect and even nourish the dominant classes. These regimes did not abjure land reforms or industrialization but carried them out in the service of the dominant classes. There was a great concern for the life and liberty of the working people, but mainly in the manner of noblesse oblige. In 1961, after two five-year plans, India’s Nehru rued the failure of his regime to tend to the sufferings of the population. Rather than create even the semblance of equality, social development had grown the divide between the affluent and the afflicted. “Large numbers of people have not shared in [the increase in the nation’s wealth] and live without the primary necessities of life. On the other side you see a smaller group of really affluent people. They have established an affluent society for themselves, anyhow, although India as a whole may be far from it. I think the new wealth is flowing in a particular direction and not spreading out properly.”<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en598" id="Ref-en598"><sup>28</sup></a> Instead of doing much to turn the divide around, the state simply tried to siphon more welfare toward the poor. Short of socialism, the national liberation state in places like India wanted to produce higher growth rates. As output increased, regardless of the means to do so, the state would have a larger aggregate pool of capital and resources to distribute to the population. Market socialism or the mixed economy was a socialism of consumption not production. In the attempt to industrialize and create agricultural change, there was only a muted effort to change the relations and methods of production. The process of industrial as well as agricultural production remained similar to that found in any advanced capitalist country: workers had no say in the process of production, which was run by a detached management class. Deliberation was kept to a minimum. Socialism made its appearance in the marketplace and on the threshing floor—to more equitably divide the spoils rather than to more equitably produce them in the first place.</div>
<div class="tx">Even those Third World states most prone toward the creation of a domestic bourgeoisie and the protections of the dominant (rural and urban) classes clamored for land reform in the 1950s. At the UN General Assembly, their bloc put forward a resolution for land reform several times (1950, 1952, 1954, 1957, and 1960). The resolutions, while somewhat different, all pushed the view that land reform was “one of the main prerequisites for the general improvement of agricultural productivity.”<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en599" id="Ref-en599"><sup>29</sup></a> Until <?dp n="221" folio="200" ?> the early 1960s, the general consensus was that if the Third World did not improve its agricultural output, it would not be able to break out of its low level of economic productivity. Industrial growth required some measure of agrarian dynamism, because taxes on and export earnings from the latter would help pay for the creation of a domestic industry.</div>
<div class="tx">While the postcolonial regimes wanted to see agricultural growth increase, not all of them were eager to see the rural landed lose their means and political clout. In 1932, the El Salvadorian rural elites engineered the massacre of twenty thousand peasants who occupied private land and opposed export-led agriculture.<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en600" id="Ref-en600"><sup>30</sup></a> Latin American history is filled with many such rebellions and mass reprisals. In 1944, when the leading Indian capitalists enjoined the state to protect their businesses with tariffs, they asked the Congress not to indulge itself with the reconstruction of agrarian relations in the new India. Any change might raise the expectations of the peasantry.<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en601" id="Ref-en601"><sup>31</sup></a> When India won its freedom, the Congress relied on rural power brokers to deliver the vote. It did not want to alienate the landowners who financed these agents of the party.<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en602" id="Ref-en602"><sup>32</sup></a> To avoid substantive land reform and yet adopt its slogan, the regime rested easy in the work of “saints” like Vinoba Bhava, who “created an illusion among the peasants that some landlords were indeed generous and magnanimous.”<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en603" id="Ref-en603"><sup>33</sup></a> In the Philippines, the Land Reform Act of 1955 froze land relations in plantation-like conditions, with only a few modest allowances given to the landless workers.<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en604" id="Ref-en604"><sup>34</sup></a> These states valorized the undifferentiated peasant or farmer: the Indian <i>kisan</i> and the Egyptian fellahin (or even the Latin American campesino). The farmers, even if they were the rural dominant class, were treated as the backbone of the nation, the salt of the earth.</div>
<div class="tx">In some instances, land reforms came about when the regimes felt that anything short would result in a red revolution. Samuel Huntington’s formula worked in states such as South Korea, Japan, and Taiwan (where land reform was conducted at the barrel of Japanese and later U.S. guns): “The willingness of landowners to lose their property through land reforms short of revolution varies directly with the extent to which the only alternative appears to be to lose it through revolution.”<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en605" id="Ref-en605"><sup>35</sup></a></div>
<div class="tx">The consensus over land reform changed in the 1960s as a new kind of agrarian solution entered the Third World. In 1945, the Rockefeller Foundation had piloted a program in Mexico to increase the agricultural yield using high-yield seeds and new agricultural methods (such as petrochemical fertilizers, pesticides, and mechanized farm implements). Mexico’s wheat crop grew geometrically, and by 1964 this net grain importer<?dp n="222" folio="201" ?> began to export wheat.<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en606" id="Ref-en606"><sup>36</sup></a> The World Bank joined hands and broadcast this “Green Revolution” around the world. On almost half the land area of the Third World agricultural growth rates skyrocketed. In India, for instance, the technological solutions increased aggregate food availability. But there were problems. The growth had enormous regional imbalances, and the environmental impact of the highly noxious fertilizers created long-term problems. Further, the technological additives to the process raised the costs for the farmers. The Green Revolution also favored larger farms, and so it decreased both the call for land reform and its importance. At the 1967 Punta Del Este Conference of Latin American states, the delegates called for a reassessment of “unjust structures of land tenure and use,” but this was window-dressing. The U.S.-born and Latin American UN Food and Agriculture Organization agronomist Solon Barraclough, who wrote the final declaration at Punta Del Este, was clear about the hollowness of these calls for land reform: “These post-1961 land reforms were for the most part, however, merely cosmetic. Often they were programs primarily designed to colonize state lands (often at unacceptable human and ecological costs) and to bail out large estate owners in economic difficulties by buying their lands for resettlement.”<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en607" id="Ref-en607"><sup>37</sup></a> By 1972, when these same Third World powers gathered in Stockholm to found the UN Environmental Program, their main grouse was not the need for land reform but the prices of the technological inputs for Green Revolution–style agriculture. Transnational chemical firms charged high prices for the fertilizers, while agribusinesses enjoyed the rents on the high-yield seeds.<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en608" id="Ref-en608"><sup>38</sup></a> The Green Revolution had replaced the red one.</div>
<div class="tx">The lack of will toward the reconstruction of rural social relations in most of the darker nations did not mean that the state abandoned the landless and the small farmers to their own misery. It had a plan for them, but not one that dealt with their principle disadvantage: their lack of power in their localities and lack of control over the main instruments of production (land, water, and credit). Most Third World regimes provided rural credit to small farmers, although this capital was often insufficient for their needs (in line with the Green Revolution dynamic, the All-India Rural Credit Committee of 1969 argued that commercial banks should provide rural credit, when these banks favored trade and industry).<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en609" id="Ref-en609"><sup>39</sup></a> In lieu of land reform, the Third World turned toward the question of food security. The idea of food security can be traced back to the creation of the UN Food and Agriculture Organization in 1945. Then, food security was only one part of a package that included comprehensive <?dp n="223" folio="202" ?> land reform and the creation of commodity cartels.<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en610" id="Ref-en610"><sup>40</sup></a> By the late 1960s and early 1970s, the work of the organization was reduced to the provision of food security. This goal was enshrined in the 1974 Universal Declaration on the Eradication of Hunger and Malnutrition (“Every man, woman and child has an inalienable right to be free from hunger and malnutrition”). Socialist reorganization (socialized production) was squandered for welfarist handouts (socialized distribution and consumption). To manage the problem between farm prices and shop prices, the state in most cases created an institution to buy food grain (at fair prices to the farmer) and then sell these grains in fair price shops across the country, all done through government programs like India’s Public Distribution System or Indonesia’s Badan Urusan Logistic Nasional. Most of the regimes in the Third World created these programs to keep prices stable in urban areas, cut down on private trade (which it deemed to be exploitative), and ensure that farmers could make a living growing essential food products (through what in India was called the Minimum Support Price scheme). These schemes of socialized distribution and consumption enabled small farmers to enter into cooperatives to pool their produce and attain fair prices. Milk, food grain, and (coffee and cocoa) bean cooperatives thrived in the Third World into the late 1980s.</div>
<div class="tx">In the 1980s, the World Bank rued the failure of land reform. World hunger remained, and yet rural welfare was to end. In the language of neoliberalism, the World Bank concluded that global hunger could only be alleviated “by redistributing purchasing power and resources toward those who are undernourished.”<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en611" id="Ref-en611"><sup>41</sup></a> In other words, by comprehensive land reform and the reconstruction of rural social relations.</div>
<div class="tx">Tanzania tried to move a socialist agenda, but like much of the Third World, it did so without a genuine attempt to organize the population into the ideas. It tried to act from above. When villagization failed, the state resorted to an embarrassing policy. A country with the highest rate of food grain production in Africa in the early 1960s now imported $180 million of food grains in late 1974. This exhausted Tanzania’s foreign exchange reserves and set it up to beg for foreign aid.<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en612" id="Ref-en612"><sup>42</sup></a> Then the state welcomed U.S.-based agribusinesses to build large (fifty-thousand-acre), capital-intensive farms. The Green Revolution bailed out ujamaa. <a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en613" id="Ref-en613"><sup>43</sup></a> Nyerere was left with his frustrations. In October 1975, Nyerere traveled to Mwanza where he berated the local Department of Agriculture for its poor advice to the peasants and demanded that those peasants who had been pushed into an ecological quagmire be resettled according to their wishes.<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en614" id="Ref-en614"><sup>44</sup></a> When Nyerere voluntarily left office in 1985, he <?dp n="224" folio="203" ?> retired to an experimental farm. He wanted to practice in his own small way the agricultural transformation that had eluded the Third World.</div>
<div class="tx">The pitfalls of the Third World bore heavily on it. Created by a wave of struggle, the new nations neither reorganized social relations effectively nor disrupted the colonial-type state structure bequeathed to it. By making alliances with the old social classes and adopting the colonial bureaucratic structure, the new nations essentially vitiated the Third World agenda. Military rule or military force became the order of the day, as the Third World regimes drove their demobilized populations to do what they had envisioned. The people who had driven the anticolonial struggles and had welcomed the Third World could only be seen by the new nations as compliant followers, or else as inert, or as foes. But despite all this, the political capital of the Third World remained and the project might have outlived its own pitfalls but for the frontal assault it faced in the 1970s. A debt crisis and a policy of planetary reorganization fostered by the First World assassinated the Third World.</div>
