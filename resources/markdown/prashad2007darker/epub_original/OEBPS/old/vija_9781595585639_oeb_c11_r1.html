<div class="ct"><b>BALI</b></div>
<div class="tx1">Neruda’s rage at the betrayal of popular aspirations came with a deep sense of hope that the people, organized by Communists and others, would prevail. When Communism arrived in the darker nations in the 1920s, it drew adherents who had been embittered by the failures of constitutional nationalism and revolutionary terrorism as well as empire. Intellectuals and peasants from their different places, but with equal intensity, took refuge in the new ideology, grafted it on to their various homespun versions of freedom and equality, and sewed red flags for their demonstrations. Repression followed as soon as they let out their flags. Empire knew immediately that Communism spelled its doom. It did not stop to negotiate with the Communists; it wanted only to annihilate them. Neruda sings of the formation of the Communist Party of Chile in the 1920s, of the foundation of the party by people like Luis Emilio Recabarren to the massacres of its members by the oligarchy. And then, in “Recabarren,” Neruda explodes:<div class="atx1"><div class="tx1">How much has happened since then, <br/>How much blood upon blood, <br/>How many struggles upon the earth. <br/>Hours of splendid conquest, <br/>Triumphs won drop by drop, <br/>Bitter streets, defeated, <br/>Zones dark as tunnels, <br/>Razor-edged betrayals <br/>That seemed to sever life, <?dp n="173" folio="152" ?> <br/>Repressions armed with hatred, <br/>Militarily crowned.</div>
<div> <br/></div><div class="tx1">The earth seemed to give way.</div>
<div> <br/></div><div class="tx1">But the struggle goes on.<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en442" id="Ref-en442"><sup>1</sup></a></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="tx">As Neruda hid from the authorities in the borderlands of Chile, across the Pacific Ocean, the Communists in Indonesia faced their first major bloodbath, in Madiun in eastern Java. Unhappy with the nationalist negotiations with the Dutch, the Indonesian Communist Party (PKI) urged a popular uprising against both the Dutch and the newly emergent bourgeoisie in Indonesia. Defeated in street battles in Surakanta, the PKI (and the Trotskyists) regrouped in Madiun, where they faced the full force of the military. The army killed many of the PKI’s leaders, jailed about 36,000 people, and crushed the party into relative insignificance. The “adventure of 1948” ended swiftly. President Sukarno’s rise to power came with the blood of the Communists on his hands. His fall, in 1965, would be accompanied by the murder of one or perhaps two million Communists and sympathizers.</div>
<div class="tx">Sukarno was not an adherent of Communism, and was discomforted by the creation of the PKI in 1920. Nevertheless, in 1926, he wrote an important book that gestured toward cooperation between Islam, Marxism, and nationalism, to Sukarno the three main resources for the Indonesian freedom movement.<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en443" id="Ref-en443"><sup>2</sup></a> In 1960, President Sukarno created an ideological framework for his nationalist party and the new national institutions: NASAKOM drew its inspiration from nationalism (NAS), religion (A, <i>agama</i>, the Sanskrit word for religion, which Sukarno deployed as a way to draw Hinduism, a major minority faith, into the web of Indonesia), and Communism (KOM). The agenda for national construction, Sukarno recognized, needed the PKI, which not only had a program worthy of Sukarno’s project but also had an experienced and disciplined cadre. As Sukarno moved toward the Left, the PKI became a critical base for him.</div>
<div class="tx">In 1951, the PKI had sufficiently recovered from the adventure of 1948 to choose a group of young leaders to revitalize the party. Among the quartet of leaders stood Dipa Nusantara Aidit, who argued that the party could not have any influence if it did not grow. As a result, the PKI decided that its standards for membership should not be too celestial because “from a large quantity it is far more possible to achieve higher quality.”<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en444" id="Ref-en444"><sup>3</sup></a> The PKI grew rapidly; by 1965, 3.5 million people <?dp n="174" folio="153" ?> were members of the party. To move into all aspects of Indonesian life, the PKI revived its mass organizations. By 1965, the youth group (Pemuda Rakyat) boasted a membership of 3 million, while the women’s organization (Gerwani) had 1.5 million. Adding these members to those from the trade union federation (Sentral Organisasi Buruh), the cultural league (Lembaga Kebudayaan Rakyat), the peasant’s front (Barisan Tani Indonesia), and the scholar’s association (Himpunan Sarjana Indonesia), the party commanded the loyalty of more than 20 million Indonesians, in a country of 110 million. PKI had a substantial presence in the archipelago, with its greatest growth rate being on the island of Bali.<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en445" id="Ref-en445"><sup>4</sup></a></div>
<div class="tx">Despite this massive growth, the PKI under Aidit did not make any move to take state power. The labor unions seized control of Dutch-owned firms in late 1957, but that was as far as they would go. In 1957–58, in Sumatra and Sulawesi, the military and the right wing joined together to create liberated areas and arrest PKI cadres. Instead of using this as an opportunity to crack down on the old social classes and the military, the PKI leadership put its faith in Sukarno. Aidit followed a well-hewed analysis among Marxists across the Third World: that a relatively nonindustrial society cannot have a proletarian revolution, and so the Communist Party must work alongside progressive sections of the bourgeoisie to create democratic capitalism. When the conditions of industry are more developed, the Communists can come to state power. This was the dominant position articulated by the Soviet Union and the Chinese, who gave support to Communist parties as long as they maintained an alliance with the progressive section of the national bourgeoisie. On the basis of this premise, Aidit articulated a four-part strategy: to enlarge the party and its mass organizations, constrain or win over the progressive sections of the national elite, “use” Sukarno’s move to the Left, and neutralize the armed forces.<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en446" id="Ref-en446"><sup>5</sup></a> The PKI was able to both grow and make a connection with Sukarno, but it was not able to insinuate itself into the imagination of the national elite or make a crack in the armed forces.</div>
<div class="tx">The PKI developed cells of party members inside the armed forces. By 1955, about 30 percent of those in uniform leaned toward the PKI (mainly those from the ranks, not from the officer corps). In response to the Sumatra and Sulawesi rebellions (which were supported by the CIA), Sukarno declared martial law (from March 1957 to May 1963). By this means, he attempted to secure the officer corps to his side. He succeeded in bolstering the role of the army, which received $20 million from the U.S. government for an upgraded military assistance program.<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en447" id="Ref-en447"><sup>6</sup></a> The army regained its stature despite the PKI’s efforts to send it back to the barracks.<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en448" id="Ref-en448"><sup>7</sup></a></div>
<?dp n="175" folio="154" ?><div class="tx">Irresolute, Sukarno brought Indonesia into the 1960s with a strong army and a strong Communist Party, with his own Guided Democracy experiment eager for the disciplined loyalty of the former and the economic program of the latter. Aidit’s PKI realized that the growth of military power needed to be countered on the streets and in the <i>kampungs</i> (villages). In early May 1965, the politburo of the PKI called for the creation of “people’s revolutionary mass actions from below” to bolster the “revolutionary mass actions by the bodies of the state from above.” Aidit wanted to create a “fifth force” of armed workers and peasants. The party set up a training camp in Lubang Buaja for the PKI’s youth wing. The armed defense of the NASAKOM had to be conducted by the PKI, or else the state would fall to the military and the old social classes.</div>
<div class="tx">In 1965, the year of living dangerously, the army pretended that this fifth force had begun a rebellion. It overthrew Sukarno and installed General Suharto. So far, little distinguishes the Indonesian case from that of most coups d’état in the bruised nations. But the direction of Indonesian history takes a nasty turn. In September 1959, Sukarno presciently told the PKI at its sixth congress, “You are my blood relatives, you are my brothers, and if you die, it is I who shall be the loser.”<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en449" id="Ref-en449"><sup>8</sup></a> To invoke death was to have seen into the future, for Suharto’s army unleashed all the anticommunist social forces, and itself, on to the PKI, its mass members, and its supporters, or else anyone who stood to the Left. Between 1965 and 1966, anywhere from one hundred thousand to two million people fell to their deaths before Suharto’s New Order.<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en450" id="Ref-en450"><sup>9</sup></a> Aidit tried to flee to Yogyakarta, but he was caught and killed. The new regime dismissed the massacre as the anger of a population suppressed by Communism and Sukarno. Suharto dismissed all culpability and scoffed at any suggestion that his military had anything to do with the genocide.</div>
<div class="tx">The island of Bali lost about 8 percent of its population, or a hundred thousand people, in the assault on the PKI in 1965–66.<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en451" id="Ref-en451"><sup>10</sup></a> Bali is now thought of simply as a planetary tourist paradise, ruffled only by the bomb blasts of October 2002.<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en452" id="Ref-en452"><sup>11</sup></a> One can stroll about the island today with little sense that in December 1965, after they had sent many PKI to the grave in Java, the Resimen Para Komando Angkatan Darat (Army Paracommando Regiment) arrived on Bali to begin the slaughter. Near the Bali Beach Hotel, the commandos started to kill, as others shipped entire villages to anticommunist strongholds where murder had been streamlined.<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en453" id="Ref-en453"><sup>12</sup></a> The disappeared villages transformed the countryside, <?dp n="176" folio="155" ?> which later appeared “pockmarked with the blackened shells of former settlements.”<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en454" id="Ref-en454"><sup>13</sup></a> In the village of Kesiman, the army and its allies killed five hundred people and jailed another three hundred out of a total population of four thousand. Asked about the event years later, the survivors remembered “the height of the terror as a time when the streets were littered with body parts, innards, and blood and the rivers were overrun with the stench of death.”<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en455" id="Ref-en455"><sup>14</sup></a></div>
<div class="tx">The actual massacre came at the hands of the army and the activists of the right-wing, mainly theocratic, political parties. They had lists of names of activists and organizers of the PKI and its affiliated organizations. They used these lists to gather the victims for execution. Although the U.S. and Australian governments neither instigated nor conducted the massacre, they encouraged the purge, fattened the lists of Communists for the army, funded the paracommandos, and supported the media effort to blame the entire genocide on the Communists.<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en456" id="Ref-en456"><sup>15</sup></a> Reports of the atrocities began to pile up in the document room of the U.S. embassy in Jakarta, with one summary going by telegram to the State Department at Foggy Bottom with this description of events in Aceh: “Moslem fervor in Atjeh apparently put all but few PKI out of action. Atjehnese have decapitated PKI and placed their heads on stakes along the road. Bodies of PKI victims reportedly thrown into rivers or seas as Atjehnese refuse to ‘contaminate Atjeh soil.’ ” A few weeks later, the embassy reported, “The Army with the help of IP-KI [the League of Upholders of Indonesian Independence, a group integrally linked to the army] Youth organizations and other anti-communist elements has continued systematic drive to destroy PKI in northern Sumatra with wholesale killings reported.” News came from Bali that with eighty thousand dead, there was “no end in sight.” To minimize the role of the U.S.-backed army and New Order regime, the embassy noted, “Many of the killings that are taking place under a political cover are actually motivated by personal and clan vendettas.”<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en457" id="Ref-en457"><sup>16</sup></a> The U.S. State Department acknowledged in the 1990s that its agents had given lists of PKI members to the New Order regime, and that it had done little to stop the violence. <a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en458" id="Ref-en458"><sup>17</sup></a> The historian Geoffrey Robinson’s assessment is that “even if it is not possible to establish definitively the extent of U.S. complicity, it can be demonstrated that U.S. policy contributed substantially to the seizure of power by the military under Suharto and to the massacre that ensued.”<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en459" id="Ref-en459"><sup>18</sup></a> Robinson left out the Australian and British governments, both of which played significant roles in the liquidation of the PKI.<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en460" id="Ref-en460"><sup>19</sup></a></div>
<?dp n="177" folio="156" ?><div class="tx">The genocide produced little outrage from around the world. When it became clear what the army had begun to do in Java and Sumatra, the United Nations felt it more important to urge, in the abstract, “all Governments to make special efforts during the United Nations Development Decade to promote respect for and observance of human rights and fundamental freedoms.”<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en461" id="Ref-en461"><sup>20</sup></a> Admittedly, Sukarno had removed Indonesia from the United Nations some months before the coup, but when Suharto applied for reentry in 1966, the General Assembly welcomed the dictator without any public condemnation. Pockets of the dedicated Left within Europe and the United States organized vigils and issued statements, but the mainstream media turned a blind eye. With a hundred thousand people held as political prisoners in the New Order, exiled leftist Carmel Budiardjo arrived in London and set up Tapol, an organization to help free these prisoners. Tapol worked with Bertrand Russell and his foundation to publicize the scale of the atrocity, but few listened.<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en462" id="Ref-en462"><sup>21</sup></a> The governments of the First World had already pledged themselves to criticize the USSR and “Communism” to the exclusion of all else; they would certainly not come to the defense of the Communists against a “factor of stability” who would soon become their great ally. Nobody collated the <i>Black Book of Anti-Communism</i>.</div>
<div class="tx">Moscow and Beijing remained mute. Since the 1920s, the USSR had an ambiguous relationship with Communist parties in the darker nations. On the one hand, the USSR had been the one state that gave enormous ideological, diplomatic, and material support to many independence struggles. The early Comintern meetings, the publication of all the imperialist treaties on colonial domination by the new government, the Baku Congress of 1920, the 1928 Brussels meeting of the League against Imperialism, and many other events and episodes signal the immense contribution the USSR had played to assist the growth of social and political struggle in the nascent Third World. The Comintern, from the early 1920s to 1935, urged Communists in the darker nations to keep some distance between their activity and that of the nationalist groups in their regions. In China, though, the Comintern pushed the Communists into an alliance with the nationalist Kuomintang that ended in the disastrous Kuomintang 1928 massacre of the Communists in Shanghai. The space allowed by the Comintern resulted in the creation of hundreds of Communist parties on the three continents, from Nicaragua to South Africa to Indonesia. In South America, the Communist parties that grew the fastest (in Argentina, Chile, and Uruguay) enveloped the Socialist parties and became heir to their organizational apparatus. Elsewhere, the <?dp n="178" folio="157" ?> Communists had to start from scratch, often on terrain that had no industrial working class and only a limited history of socialist struggle (such as in Vietnam).</div>
<div class="tx">At the 1935 Seventh Comintern Congress, the Soviet Communists reacted to the development of fascism within Europe by telling Communist parties to work in a “popular front” with all patriotic social forces. The Comintern asked Communist parties to work in coalition with all other antifascist forces, in order to enlarge its ambit by working in tandem with other classes, including sections of the bourgeoisie. While the strategy of the Comintern developed out of the German Communist Party’s failure to stop the Nazi rise to power in 1933, that experience now came to dominate the work of Communists in far different settings. Furthermore, as the USSR shifted its own international alliances, first with a pact with the Nazis in 1939, then in one with the Allies against the Nazis in 1941, the Communist parties in the periphery had to scurry to find reasons for their own turbulent swings. While the idea of a popular front (and a united front) played an important role in ameliorating the adventurism of the Communists of the 1920s, it did not necessarily lead the Communists in the darker nations to take the opportunity to expand their constituency. The parties made opportunistic alliances with the nationalist forces, often with the encouragement of Moscow, and they used this place as a way to wield rather than to build power. The USSR urged local Communist parties to go into hibernation or else make alliances with ghastly political forces in the name of unity often because these forces wanted to make an expedient link with the USSR against the depredations of imperialism. By the advent of the Cold War in the late 1940s, the class collaborationist line had substantially weakened the Communist parties in the Third World, and they became easy prey for attack by the CIA and the nationalist regimes.<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en463" id="Ref-en463"><sup>22</sup></a></div>
<div class="tx">Within Moscow and Beijing, there was no theoretical unanimity on the question of alliances and revolution. Debates raged along many lines. One position argued that each society must first develop its domestic industry, and only then when its means of production are well established can its proletariat overcome the morally supine bourgeoisie. Such a view acknowledged that history must move in stages, and only after a given society had moved from the feudal stage to the capitalist one could a transition to socialism be possible. Another, counter opinion suggested that given the way the darker nations had been held in a situation of permanent dependence, it would be impossible for them to develop into capitalist societies. To hope that the national bourgeoisie <?dp n="179" folio="158" ?> would be capable of creating a capitalist society with the stake set against these new nations would be quixotic. Therefore the Communists had to seize power, delink the new state from international capital, and rush the country through the stages. In China, Liu Shao-ch’i articulated the “stagist” view, while Lin Biao took the “uninterrupted revolution” approach. Similar divides manifested themselves in Moscow and elsewhere.</div>
<div class="tx">Regardless of the debates, by the 1960s both Moscow and Beijing produced concepts that validated the Communist alliance with bourgeois democratic forces. In 1960, the USSR unveiled its concept, the national democratic state, which referred to those noncommunist national liberation states that emerged within the Third World. These states governed according to their own variant of socialism (Arab socialism, African socialism, NASAKOM).<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en464" id="Ref-en464"><sup>23</sup></a> Beijing proposed the theory of new democracy: a coalition of four classes (the proletariat, the peasantry, the petty bourgeoisie, and the domestic capitalists) would join together against imperialism to develop the country toward socialism. The Communist Party would lead these classes, which would develop capitalism to expedite growth rates and the transition to socialism.<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en465" id="Ref-en465"><sup>24</sup></a> Both Moscow and Beijing, therefore, guided the Communists in the darker nations to make allowances for the national bourgeoisie. They had to work in “national democratic fronts” and create the groundwork for a future socialist transition.<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en466" id="Ref-en466"><sup>25</sup></a></div>
<div class="tx">The concepts of the national democratic state and new democracy allowed Moscow and Beijing to accept noncommunist regimes and national liberation movements as sufficient for the nonindustrial world. The conflict between Moscow and Beijing also added to their lack of scrupulousness when seeking alliances. The development of Communism became almost secondary to the promotion of national democratic fronts. Given this line of analysis, the USSR and the People’s Republic of China gave perhaps more support to the national democratic leaders who preached socialism and had control of a state than to emergent Communist parties that had organized across the exploited classes and others into a movement to change the basis of social production. Nasser’s Egypt, Qasim’s Iraq, Boumédienne’s Algeria, Indira Gandhi’s India, Ne Win’s Burma, Sékou Touré’s Guinea, Ayub Khan’s Pakistan, and Modibo Keita’s Mali became part of the USSR’s and the People’s Republic of China’s most favored states, even though most of these leaders suppressed their local Communist parties.</div>
<div class="tx">By the early 1960s, the three largest Communist parties (outside a Communist state) in Asia, Africa, and the Arab lands were the PKI of <?dp n="180" folio="159" ?> Indonesia, Sudan’s al-Hizb al-Shuyu’i al-Sudani (SCP), and the Iraqi Communist Party (ICP), respectively. These parties commanded the respect of a large section of their societies and controlled important people’s organizations (including trade unions, women’s leagues, and youth associations). Within a decade, these three parties would be devastated when the national bourgeoisie (with the assistance of the United States as well as a blind eye from Moscow and Beijing) would call the military out of the barracks to exterminate them. If the USSR and the People’s Republic of China had taken a strong stand in any one of these instances, they might have given courage to Communists elsewhere to continue with their work. Instead, the silence scared Communists into alliances with political forces that wanted to use and then destroy them.</div>
<div class="tx">The Communists were useful. Sukarno needed the PKI for its program and cadre. When Brigadier Qasim overthrew the Iraqi monarchy (1958) and Colonel Jaafar al-Nimeiri rejected a corrupt military junta in Sudan (1969), both leaned on the strong Communist parties to extend their power. A military coup has little institutional basis for legitimacy—people might respect the individual leaders or their cliques for their honesty, and wish them well, but these leaders or cliques have only the institutions of the armed forces to help give the coup legitimacy. In addition, most military factions come to power without a detailed program because army personnel have little experience in politics. In the case of Iraq and Sudan, the leaders made alliances with the Communists both for their capacity to reach into the social worlds of the Iraqis and the Sudanese, but also to borrow from their established programs for social change. Qasim did not personally share the Communists’ views, but he knew that his coup would languish without them. By 1958, all political parties had absorbed the social program of the ICP, a testament to its relevance and probity. Even the Baath, no friend to Communism, adopted elements of the ICP’s program. When the ICP took advantage of the opening to revive its banned organizations such as the Peace Partisans, the League for the Defense of Women’s Rights (<i>al-Rabita</i>), and the League of Iraqi Youth, the ICP grew to more than twenty-five thousand cadre members with an additional mass membership of a million (about a fifth of the total population of Iraq).<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en467" id="Ref-en467"><sup>26</sup></a></div>
<div class="tx">The growth of the ICP and its social power terrified the dictatorship of Qasim. Shortly after Qasim came to power, the founder of the Baath, Michel ‘Aflaq, visited Baghdad from Damascus to promote his party over the ICP. “We represent the Arab spirit against materialist Communism,” he told the Iraqis. “Communism is western, and alien to everything <?dp n="181" folio="160" ?> Arab.”<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en468" id="Ref-en468"><sup>27</sup></a> The Baath had only three hundred members in Iraq, and would grow to only three thousand in the early 1960s. In May 1959, Husain ar-Radi, the ICP’s first secretary, entered a politburo meeting and argued that the time had come for the party to make a move for power. He was outvoted. The Soviets had sent an envoy with a message not to provoke Qasim.<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en469" id="Ref-en469"><sup>28</sup></a> The Baath took the initiative; the United States backed it. The ICP defended the nationalist military regime when the Baath attempted a coup in October 1959. It quickly took charge of the Ministry of Defense and the communications network. Half a million Communists and their allies filled the streets. This terrified the colonels, who began to decimate the ICP, their only organized defenders. Qasim ignored the Baath, even after they attempted to assassinate him in late 1959 (led by the young Saddam Hussein). The Baath’s way had been prepared, and it eventually captured the state in 1963.<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en470" id="Ref-en470"><sup>29</sup></a> The window to the future closed.</div>
<div class="tx">In 1968, Hussein came to power. The USSR became a major ally of Hussein, who cultivated a split in the battered ICP. As Hussein made an alliance with the USSR, a pro-Soviet faction of the ICP joined hands with him. The anti-Baath group, the ICP (Central Leadership) led by ‘Aziz al-Hajj felt the wrath of the Baath’s militia, the Jihaz Haneen. The USSR, meanwhile, provided Iraq with one of the five nuclear reactors that it built in the bruised nations, welcomed more students from Iraq than any other Third World state, and provided considerable military and industrial assistance in exchange for oil. The ICP that remained within the government enabled Iraq’s 1972 friendship treaty with the USSR, but as Hussein increased his hold on the country he began a campaign against the ICP itself. In 1978, Hussein had the “loyal” party members arrested, executed many cadre, and used the ICP’s suppression to send a strong message to his own Baath that all loyalty had to be to his regime, and not to an ideology or another party. Hussein’s campaign against the ICP led to his enhanced stock among Washington policymakers, whose own alliance with him began in 1983. The remainder of the ICP’s cadre either fled overseas or else remained within Iraq to continue the struggle, notably in the Kurdish regions (long a bastion of the Left). The Communists that remained in Iraq clandestinely fought on against the Baath and smuggled out documents on the atrocities against Iraqis by the Hussein regime.<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en471" id="Ref-en471"><sup>30</sup></a></div>
<div class="tx">In Sudan, Nimeiri came to power on a Nasserite agenda, and he, like Qasim, could not rule without the SCP. After the coup he banned all political parties, but allowed the SCP to continue its activities. Founded in 1944, the SCP was the only political party with national standing because, <?dp n="182" folio="161" ?> unlike the sectarian and racialist parties, it recruited equally in the north and south, among Christians as well as Muslims. Nimeiri needed the SCP. In the typical formula, Nimeiri first went after his right flank. In 1970, he began an assault on the reactionary Umma Party led by Sadiq al-Mahdi. When that party had been substantially pacified, Nimeiri turned his attention to the SCP. The brutal repression of the SCP drove the Communists to attempt a coup of their own along with sympathetic army officers. The Nimeiri regime arrested the party leadership, executed most of them (including Abdel al-Khaliq Mahjub, Joseph Garang, and Ahmed El Sheikh), and urged their followers to “destroy anyone who claims there is a Sudanese Communist Party. Destroy this alleged Party.”<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en472" id="Ref-en472"><sup>31</sup></a> When news of the events in Sudan reached the Soviet leadership, it tried to negotiate with the Nimeiri government, as well as with the Egyptians and the Libyans, for asylum to the SCP’s leaders. Once rebuffed, it did not pursue the matter. It is not that Moscow felt nothing for its comrades in the tropics, but that the fortunes of the Communist parties in the Third World came second to the strategy mapped out by the USSR and the People’s Republic of China. When the Nimeiri regime executed the SCP leaders despite the entreaty from the USSR, Moscow rewarded the dictator with economic and political treaties as well as a special honored place as a delegate to the Communist Party of the USSR’s twenty-fourth Congress in late 1971. In Syria (1972) and Iraq (1973), the USSR brokered a deal to create national fronts so that the Communist parties in both countries would enter the government in a minority, indeed second-rank position and with few rights to conduct political organization.</div>
<div class="tx">The crackdown led many Communists to the gun. In Iraq, twelve militants including Khalid Ahmed Zaki of the Popular Front for Armed Struggle attempted a quixotic insurgency in the southern marshlands in 1968, only to be gunned down by the Iraqi army. They acted a decade too late, by which time ar-Radi’s assessment had become anachronistic. The revolutionary moment had passed.<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en473" id="Ref-en473"><sup>32</sup></a> Zaki’s move to the gun came as part of the general turn of many Communist parties toward Maoism. An elementary precept of Maoism was ignored by many of these movements: they did not consider whether they had built up sufficient mass support or if there was a sufficiently mobilized mass movement to join their small armed venture. In Congo’s Kwilu region, Pierre Mulele, a minister in Lumumba’s deposed government, took up arms against Mobutu’s regime, but while his insurgency lasted a few years, it too failed to make any headway.<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en474" id="Ref-en474"><sup>33</sup></a> In India, in 1967, a breakaway group from the <?dp n="183" folio="162" ?> Communist Party of India (Marxist), which had itself broken with the pro-Soviet Communist Party of India in 1964, began armed struggle in several parts of India, once more to suffer immense defeats. In Indonesia, the PKI conducted a self-criticism of the Aidit line for its collaboration with Sukarno and began a Maoist-style guerrilla campaign on Java and the outer islands, like Kalimantan. The PKI managed to hold on to some pockets of support, and its guerrilla strategy bore some minor fruits, but in the main it was effectively wiped out as a serious contender for state power.<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en475" id="Ref-en475"><sup>34</sup></a> In South America, Maoism came as Castroism, when leftists went into armed struggle against the state from Argentina to Venezuela. As the French political activist Régis Debray put it in 1965, only armed struggle by well-trained militants can destroy the bourgeois state apparatus—a precondition for a successful revolution that will not be destroyed by a military coup.<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en476" id="Ref-en476"><sup>35</sup></a> Not one South American country had a reprieve from Castroism, and even as these suffered disastrous failures and a generation of leftists perished before the police guns, the strategy remained alive. The military usurped control of the historical dynamic, destroyed a generation of militants, and took advantage of the situation to foment a decade of military rule. Powerlessness, already a social fact in large parts of the bruised nations, grows out of the barrel of a gun.<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en477" id="Ref-en477"><sup>36</sup></a></div>
<div class="tx">As Sukarno fell, no significant word of protest came from New Delhi, Belgrade, Rangoon, Cairo, or Accra. Tepid disavowals of the violence came from their foreign ministries, but little else. Indonesia’s Sukarno had played a crucial role in the creation of the political platform of the Third World, and Bandung had been its omphalos. Yet there was silence. The personal or political demise of the five major leaders of the progressive tendency in Bandung reveals much about the collapse of solidarity: Nehru died in 1964, both U Nu and Nkrumah had been recently deposed by military coups, Nasser’s role had been weakened by the collapse of his United Arab Republic, and Tito had begun a genial rapprochement with the USSR. Nehru, U Nu, and Nasser had vexed relations with their domestic Communist parties. In 1959, Nehru used his maximum constitutional powers to eject a Communist state government in Kerala; U Nu had kept an arm’s length from the Communist Party of Burma during his short-lived reign; and the Egyptian Communist Party had dissolved itself in 1965, and asked its members to cooperate with Nasser’s regime.<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en478" id="Ref-en478"><sup>37</sup></a> The regimes of the Third World had little regard for their local Communist parties, and as long as this disdain made no impact on their relations with Moscow or Beijing, they had no obligation to speak for such atrocities as committed by the Indonesian army, the <?dp n="184" folio="163" ?> Moroccan government (against the National Union of Popular Forces, and the assassination of its leader, Ben Baraka, on the streets of Paris in 1965), and the Congolese army (against the Mouvement National Con-golais, and the assassination of its leader, Lumumba, in 1961, with Belgian collusion).</div>
<div class="tx">Both Sudan and Iraq remained a welcome part of the Third World and NAM. Sudan and Iraq, as well as Indonesia, formally continued to support the foreign policy objectives of the Third World. Indeed, Indonesia even formally adhered to the Bandung principles and this maintained the country in good stead at the political gatherings of the Third World.<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en479" id="Ref-en479"><sup>38</sup></a> During the genocide, the startlingly named Front Pancasila cheered on the army and helped conduct the mass murder.<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en480" id="Ref-en480"><sup>39</sup></a> Suharto’s Pancasila only formally resembled the Panchsheela of Bandung—for the army general’s five points included such conservative staples as “belief in the one supreme God,” “the unity of Indonesia,” and “democracy led by the wisdom of deliberation among representatives.” The original Panchsheela did not refer to God, nor to the wisdom of the representatives, which could be another way of saying that the people should defer to their betters.<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en481" id="Ref-en481"><sup>40</sup></a> When Suharto’s New Order spoke of unity, it might already have had in mind the invasion of East Timor (in 1975)—an annexation based on the army’s notion of unity, not that of either the Indonesian people or the East Timorese.</div>
<div class="tx">At the 1977 NAM meeting in New Delhi, Sudan’s representative held the delegates in thrall with a presentation on the need to restructure the United Nations so that it would be more democratic and thereby support the New International Economic Order. Iraq’s delegate presented the second of two working papers after the Sudanese, this one on the need to have a more efficient NAM structure, with better coordination through a secretariat.<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en482" id="Ref-en482"><sup>41</sup></a> Neither Iraq, Sudan, nor Indonesia were laughed out of the room—their pogroms against the Communists in each case became the sacrosanct “internal affairs” of each country. The major Third World powers accepted Indonesia, Sudan, Iraq, and others simply because they signed on to the basic principles of non-alignment, and because they shared a similar international economic analysis.</div>
<div class="tx">The destruction of the Left had an enormous impact on the Third World. The most conservative, even reactionary social classes attained dominance over the political platform created in Bandung. As an adjunct to the military regimes, the political forces that emerged rejected the ecumenical anticolonial nationalism of the Left and the liberals for a cruel cultural nationalism that emphasized racialism, religion, and <?dp n="185" folio="164" ?> hierarchy. The latter took shelter in a manufactured vision of “tradition”—they claimed to be the true spokespersons of the authentic culture of their regions, as opposed to the “modern” or “Western” influence of the progressive Left. The myth of Bali as paradise and Arabs as puritanical, or Hindus as hierarchical and Africans as tribal—all these visions of tradition emerged with a vengeance from the old social classes as a way to battle the Left, and once the latter had been shunned, claim that they were the authentic representatives of their civilization. “The Bali myth,” the historian Robinson argues, for instance, “has helped to falsify history in a way that has served the people in power while silencing those who have suffered injustice.”<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en483" id="Ref-en483"><sup>42</sup></a></div>
<div class="tx">Some U.S. government officials in the field bemoaned their cozy relationship with oligarchies and militaries against the Communists. For example, the deputy chief of the U.S. embassy in Guatemala in the 1950s, Bill Krieg, noted that the reactionary forces were “bums of the first order” who “wanted money, were palace hangers-on,” while the Communists “could work, had a sense of direction, ideas, knew where they wanted to go.” They were “honest, very committed. This was the tragedy: the only people who were committed to hard work were those who were, by definition, our worst enemies.”<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en484" id="Ref-en484"><sup>43</sup></a> The CIA and the old social classes crushed the Left in many parts of the darker nations, enlivened the old social classes, and later—much later—found that they had created a monster they could not control.</div>
