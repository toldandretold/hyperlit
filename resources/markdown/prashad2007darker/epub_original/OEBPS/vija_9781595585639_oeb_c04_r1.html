<b>CAIRO</b>
<div class="tx1">Unlike Bandung, Cairo in the 1950s had the feeling of a defiant city on a war footing, ready to take on the First World with rhetoric or guns, if necessary. In 1952, a group of young officers in the Egyptian army seized power. Organized by Lieutenant Colonel Gamal Abdel Nasser, the Free Officers forced out a monarchy long tainted by corruption and subservience to European interests. The Free Officers represented all the major strains of Egyptian political life. There were old-school nationalists of the Wafd Party, members of the Muslim Brotherhood, Communists, and also aristocrats who had lost faith in King Farouk. The diversity was a testament to the organizational capacity of Nasser, who understood the necessity for broad unity in the fight against the monarchy. Most of the officers who joined and supported the coup came because it represented the aspirations of the “new middle class” of bureaucratic and technical workers. The ideology of Pan-Arabism and the secular Turkish lineage of Kemal Ataturk appealed to their ideas about Egyptian modernity. Initially, the officers had hoped to assassinate a slew of monarchists and paralyze the government. As Nasser drove away from a failed bid to kill General Hussein Sirri Amer, he heard “the sounds of screaming and wailing. I heard a woman crying, a child terrified, and a continuous, frightened call for help.”<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en135" id="Ref-en135"><sup>1</sup></a> Rather than kill Amer, the officers had hit some innocents. “We dream of the glory of our nation,” Nasser later wrote, “but which is the better way to bring it about—to eliminate those who should be eliminated, or to bring forward those who should be brought forward?”<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en136" id="Ref-en136"><sup>2</sup></a> The holstered gun alongside the mass rallies would become the preferred instrument of revolution.</div>
<?dp n="73" folio="52" ?><div class="tx">Nasser took charge of the revolution and made from the many lineages that produced it the ideology of Arab Socialism. The United States and Europe did not reciprocate Egypt’s request for assistance, so Nasser’s government turned to the USSR and its allies. Nasser goaded the French further with his support for the Algerian FLN; indeed, Egypt became one of the FLN’s principle supporters in its fight against French colonialism. The United States revoked its agreement to finance the Aswan Dam, and Nasser retaliated by seizing the Suez Canal, then owned by a French company.<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en137" id="Ref-en137"><sup>3</sup></a> In late 1956, an Anglo-French-Israeli expeditionary force landed in Suez to counter this, and the Egyptians fought back valiantly, only to be saved in the last instance by U.S., USSR, and Third World condemnations of the assault. The streets of Cairo overflowed with the voice of the diva of the East Umm Kulthum, singing <i>Misr Tatahaddath ‘an Nafsiha</i> (Egypt Speaks of Herself) and <i>Misr allati fi khatiri wa-fi Dami</i> (Egypt, which is in my mind and in my blood), or else,<div class="atx1"><div class="tx1">He taught us how to build glory. <br/>So that we conquered the world. <br/>Not through hope will the prize be obtained. <br/>The world must be taken through struggle.</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="tx">Nasser embodied the hopes of the Egyptians and the Arabs for several years after the coup of 1952, and when he returned from Bandung, he brought with him news that the world looked to Egypt for leadership against the barbarism of the Cold War. The Egyptian government opened its doors to the Afro-Asian solidarity organizations, especially by being the secretariat of numerous Afro-Asian and non-aligned institutions. Cairo became the headquarters of the movement, the host to a number of important conferences and conclaves, and the meeting place for Arab nationalists from across North Africa and West Asia.<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en138" id="Ref-en138"><sup>4</sup></a></div>
<div class="tx">In late December 1957, Cairo hosted the Afro-Asian People’s Solidarity Conference, the next major event after Bandung. Forty-five African and Asian countries sent their delegates—double the number at Bandung. While Bandung welcomed a diverse set of views, this conference took a partisan position against the First World—coming as it did just after Suez, and in the wake of the acerbic comments on decolonization by political leaders from Britain (Anthony Eden) and the United States (John Foster Dulles). Anwar es-Sadat, then Nasser’s closest adviser, played host to the conference. In his welcome address, Sadat <?dp n="74" folio="53" ?> accepted the Bandung flame for Cairo. Delegates from newly liberated countries joined leaders of ongoing national liberation movements (notably from the world of the Portuguese colonies).</div>
<div class="tx">What also separated this conference from Bandung was the presence of women not only in the hall but also at the podium. One of the three plenary addresses came from the Gandhian Rameshwari Nehru, whose social reform work in India later earned her the Lenin Peace Prize (1961). The most remarkable figure at the conference, however, came from Egypt itself. Aisha Abdul-Rahman was born into a devout family from the Damietta Port region of northern Egypt in 1913. Her father taught at a local theological institute, while her great grandfather had been the grand imam of al-Azhar in the nineteenth century. With the encouragement of her mother and grandfather, Abdul-Rahman studied through correspondence courses (her father would not allow her to go to school). In 1929, through the mail, Abdul-Rahman earned the first teacher’s qualification from al-Azhar University (women were only allowed on the campus in 1964). At age twenty-one, Abdul-Rahman enrolled in King Faud I (later Cairo) University, from which she earned a PhD in early Arabic literature. The university initially only allowed foreign women to attend a few classes, but thanks to a progressive rector, Ahmad Lutfi al-Sayyid, five women matriculated in 1929. Sohair al-Qalamawy, a pioneering Egyptian advocate for women’s rights, was one of them.<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en139" id="Ref-en139"><sup>5</sup></a> She would soon be followed by Abdul-Rahman. Long before she earned her doctorate, Abdul-Rahman had become a household name among literate circles as a popular columnist for Egypt’s leading newspaper, <i>Al-Ahram</i>. Pointed criticisms of both the monarchy and the Nasserite dictatorship came alongside several books on Arab women poets as well as her own poetry. Protected by her editor, Mohammad Heikal, Nasser’s friend and ideological anchor, Abdul-Rahman continued to openly criticize elements of the state that bothered her.<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en140" id="Ref-en140"><sup>6</sup></a> In 1957, as both a journalist and a professor of Arabic and Islamic studies at Ain Shams University in Cairo, Abdul-Rahman offered one of the main speeches at the conference.</div>
<div class="tx">The history of national liberation movements, Abdul-Rahman pointed out, often ignores the central role played by women in them, and in the liberation of women by the struggle. “The renaissance of the Eastern woman has always coincided with liberation movements,” for liberation from imperialism meant that “women were emancipated from the fetters of social slavery and escaped from moral death.” Within the confines allowed by imperialism, “women remained the victim of ignorance, <?dp n="75" folio="54" ?> isolation and slavery.” Since national liberation movements, for all their machismo and lack of appreciation for the role of women, still operate on the assumption that everyone has to be liberated, this conceit proves valuable to women who can take advantage of the opening to press for their social dignity and political rights. “The success of these revolutions depends on the liberation of the enslaved half, on rescuing women from paralysis, unemployment and inaction and eliminating the differences between the two halves of the nation—its men and women.”<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en141" id="Ref-en141"><sup>7</sup></a></div>
<div class="tx">Abdul-Rahman makes an underestimated point about the linkage between anticolonial nationalism and women’s liberation.<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en142" id="Ref-en142"><sup>8</sup></a> There is nothing that stops the former from reproducing various patriarchal ideas. Yet most of the anticolonial movements relied on women, and several of them had put women’s concerns on their freedom agenda. In 1919, Egyptian women of all classes took to the streets of Cairo to protest the British crackdown on demonstrations for a free Egypt. The women cut telephone wires and disrupted railway lines to stall the ability of the British troops who relied on them, and they attacked prisons to free their comrades. The British set aside their good manners and fired on the women radicals. Several of the women died, notably Shafika Mohamed, Hamida Khalil, Sayeda Hassan, Fahima Riad, Aisha Omar, and also, as the feminist writer Nawal El-Saadawi notes, the hundreds of poor women who “lost their lives without anybody being able to trace their names.”<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en143" id="Ref-en143"><sup>9</sup></a></div>
<div class="tx">During the major mass protests in India in 1905, 1909, 1919, 1920–21, and 1930–31, women held the streets.<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en144" id="Ref-en144"><sup>10</sup></a> Iran’s constitutional movement saw women in public protest from 1907 to 1911, and again in 1919.<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en145" id="Ref-en145"><sup>11</sup></a> Much the same has been documented for women in China, Indo-China, Indonesia, Ghana, and South Africa.<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en146" id="Ref-en146"><sup>12</sup></a> These protests, and their contacts with women from other parts of the world, emboldened the bourgeois women to form organizations and exert themselves within the framework of national liberation.<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en147" id="Ref-en147"><sup>13</sup></a></div>
<div class="tx">Well-heeled Egyptian women formed organizations for women’s rights in the aftermath of these cross-class demonstrations. Huda Sha’rawi, from a family of wealth and political power (her father was the speaker of the House of Representatives), became the pioneer of the Egyptian women’s movement. She founded the Egyptian Feminist Union in 1923, established the French-language periodical <i>L’Égyptienne</i>, and went to Rome for the 1924 International Conference of Women. Unveiled, Sha’rawi with her comrades Ceza Nabaraoui and Nabawiya Musa let European feminists know that Egyptian women came with a heritage <?dp n="76" folio="55" ?> (<i>turath</i>) from the Pharaonic era and early Islam that needed to be reclaimed. At the Rome conference, Sha’rawi reported that the European delegates wanted the Egyptians to be “romantic, ignorant heroines of the European novelists.” The idea of the veil kept the real, living struggles of the Egyptians out of the European feminist mind, which “made them ignorant of everything about us.” Yet the Egyptian woman, hidden in plain sight, understood European feminism because, as Sha’rawi remarked at the conference, “nothing is more similar to an Oriental woman than a Western woman.”<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en148" id="Ref-en148"><sup>14</sup></a></div>
<div class="tx">Many of the pioneers of the organized women’s movement came from the old social classes that had either retained their aristocratic positions despite or in spite of the pressure from imperialism. A few of the leaders came from the new social classes that had been created by imperialism (military and civilian bureaucrats and merchants). Sha’rawi’s husband, Ali, had been a founder of the Wafd Party, and her father, Sultan Pasha, was one of the richest landowners in Egypt. Abdul-Rahman’s family had no such national pretensions, but she nonetheless came from a learned, relatively prosperous section. Women such as these drew their inspiration from the mass action against imperialism that enveloped them as well as from their interactions with European women (who were in the midst of their own suffrage campaign). While they found many allies among the European women, by and large the women of the colonized world experienced a patronizing dismissal. When confronted by the hesitancy of the International Alliance of Women in 1939, Ceza Nabaraoui wrote, “What did we demand? A little sympathy for the unfortunates who suffer in the East from the wrongs of imperialist policies.” And what did they get? The International Alliance of Women proved “that their magnificent program addresses itself only to certain people of the West,” and that they “alone deigned to enjoy liberty.” <a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en149" id="Ref-en149"><sup>15</sup></a> From the contradictions of their privileged locations, bourgeois women like Sha’rawi and Nabaraoui not only put the demand for the franchise on the table but they also created organizations whose subsequent history would move far from the salons and into the byways of small villages and towns.</div>
<div class="tx">As Sha’rawi and Nabaraoui fought to win the franchise for Egyptian women within the confines of the monarchy, in distant Latin America three women mirrored their work. Amalia Caballero de Castillo Ledón worked in the Alianza de Mujeres de México, Minerva Bernardino worked in the Accion Feminista Dominica, and Bertha Lutz worked for the Brazilian Federation for Feminine Progress. All of them came from <?dp n="77" folio="56" ?> the old social classes, and each pushed a fairly conservative agenda for women’s emancipation. While they fought to get women the vote, these organizations and leaders settled for fairly patriarchal social definitions of family and marriage. The Alianza de Mujeres de México followed after the 1931 National Women’s Congress of Workers and Peasants, which had demanded land rights, adult education, and equality for the sexes in unions. Nothing of the sort entered the Alianza de Mujeres, nor did it cross the minds of Accion Feminista or Feminine Progress.<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en150" id="Ref-en150"><sup>16</sup></a> Nonetheless, these three women insisted that the phrase “the equal rights of men and women” be inserted into the UN Charter based on the discussions at the 1945 Chapultepec gathering and the 1938 Lima Conference of Latin American states.<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en151" id="Ref-en151"><sup>17</sup></a> These Latin American delegates, moreover, pushed the United Nations to form the Commission on the Status of Women underneath the UN Economic and Social Commission.</div>
<div class="tx">In 1947, the Commission on the Status of Women adopted its guidelines: to “raise the status of women irrespective of nationality, race, language, or religion to equality of men in all fields of human enterprise; and to eliminate all discrimination against women in statutory law, legal maxims or rules, or in interpretations of customary law.”<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en152" id="Ref-en152"><sup>18</sup></a> The guidelines meant nothing because they could not go into force.<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en153" id="Ref-en153"><sup>19</sup></a> It was not until 1967 that the UN Economic and Social Commission put forward the “Declaration on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women” for a vote to the UN General Assembly, all of this as a prelude to 1975 becoming the International Women’s Year when Mexico City hosted the first UN conference on women.<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en154" id="Ref-en154"><sup>20</sup></a> Bourgeois feminism of the Alianza de Mujeres and Feminine Progress variety created a set of important international institutions and platforms that would be used later by women’s rights activists aware of the deep inequality within the Third World. Such activists, who would populate the Afro-Asian meetings, did not emphasize gender struggles outside the broader struggle to create sovereign nations and working-class power within these nations.</div>
<div class="tx">Anticolonial nationalism drew from all sections of the oppressed population—men and women, working class and merchant—not only for demographic reasons but also because they had adopted the idea of equality. Few of the new states that had experienced anticolonial struggles had a problem with universal adult franchise. In Egypt, women briefly won the vote in the 1923 Constitution before the monarchy revoked their right to the ballot box. In 1952, after the Free Officers’ Revolution, Nasser promised to reinstate the vote. The two main muftis took opposite positions on this, with the Grand Mufti Shakyh Hasanayn <?dp n="78" folio="57" ?> Makhluf against it, and Shaykh Allam Nassar for it. In 1956, women won the vote again.<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en155" id="Ref-en155"><sup>21</sup></a> In the Wafd Party’s early years in power, Nasser opposed its bourgeois nationalist anxiety with egalitarian democracy (including equality between men and women).<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en156" id="Ref-en156"><sup>22</sup></a> By the 1950s, women worked within the framework of the national liberation project because it appeared that it would be able to deliver the groundwork of the eventual liberation of women, notably, as Abdul-Rahman put it in 1957, for the “awakening of consciousness and the will to live.”<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en157" id="Ref-en157"><sup>23</sup></a></div>
<div class="tx">At the 1957 conference, the Afro-Asian Solidarity Organization created an Afro-Asian Federation for Women.<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en158" id="Ref-en158"><sup>24</sup></a> The federation subsequently hosted a conference in 1961, again in Cairo, attended by delegates from thirty-seven countries and movements.<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en159" id="Ref-en159"><sup>25</sup></a> At this first Afro-Asian Women’s Conference, the delegates crafted a more coherent agenda for the struggles of women within the platform of the Third World. Few of the movements that gathered in Cairo in January 1961 saw themselves as Europe’s misbegotten sisters, and fewer still felt that they had no title to the concept of the Third World. They came to insist that their female forebears had fought in the national liberation movements and so earned the right to craft the future. Karima El Said, deputy minister of education in the United Arab Republic, welcomed the delegates from thirty-seven states with this reminder, “The woman was a strong prop in these liberation movements, she struggled with the strug-glers and she died with the martyrs.”<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en160" id="Ref-en160"><sup>26</sup></a> In the longer general report to the conference, the writers detailed the efforts of women within national liberation movements, from Vietnam to India, from Algeria to South Africa. “In Afro-Asian countries where people are still suffering under the yoke of colonialism, women are actively participating in the struggle for complete national liberation and independence of their countries. They are convinced that this is the first step for their emancipation and will equip them to occupy their real place in society.”<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en161" id="Ref-en161"><sup>27</sup></a> That is, participation in the anticolonial struggles would not only attack one of the impediments to the women’s liberation agenda but the contribution itself would transform the relations between men and women in the movement and society.<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en162" id="Ref-en162"><sup>28</sup></a> Not only did women join the guerrilla wars in Algeria, Cuba, Guinea, Indonesia, Kenya, Korea, Oman, Venezuela, Vietnam, and elsewhere but they also helped supply the fighters, aided the injured, and in Egypt, India, Zanzibar, and elsewhere, dominated the street protests.</div>
<div class="tx">Imperialism made progress for women nearly impossible.<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en163" id="Ref-en163"><sup>29</sup></a> Even if women’s movements did concentrate on various aspects of oppression, <?dp n="79" folio="58" ?> no women’s organization could afford to ignore the anti-imperialist fight. The sisterhood of those who came to Cairo had been formed in struggle against imperialism, with the expectation that political rights within the independent nation would allow them to take the struggle further. Without political rights, all the other reforms would be meaningless. The state could promise equal education and equal wages, but if women had no political rights, how would they make sure these reforms were enacted and maintained?<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en164" id="Ref-en164"><sup>30</sup></a></div>
<div class="tx">Even the brief history of independence had shown these women’s rights activists that the national liberation state should not be left alone to be magnanimous in its gestures.<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en165" id="Ref-en165"><sup>31</sup></a> The new states had not been nirvana for women. Not only do the two Cairo conferences offer a list of prescriptions, a vision of equal rights for men and women, but within these lists is also an implicit critique of the new states for their failure to promulgate many of these policies. The list demands not only that the new states adopt the new international standards <i>for which they themselves fought</i>, such as in the International Labour Organization and other UN bodies, but that they actually implement them. The birth of the nation, Abdul-Rahman reminded the conference, was only “the first step of true solidarity.”<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en166" id="Ref-en166"><sup>32</sup></a></div>
<div class="tx">Every right that the women won was not itself the end of the struggle but helped build the power to further their demands. High on the Third World women’s agenda was the stipulation that women must have choice over marriage: they must be able to dictate if they marry, when they marry, and to whom they marry. “Marriage should be based on the principle of the personal freedom of choice for the spouses concerned,” agreed the delegates to the 1957 conference. If men and women have any problems in their relationship, the state should provide them with “marriage counseling and planned parenthood.” To fight against the idea that marriage is simply about property or progeny, the conference demanded that “drastic measures should be taken to abolish polygamy.” To offer women some freedom from the domestic sphere, “working women should be entitled to free medical care during pregnancy and childbirth, and to a suitable holiday with full pay during childbirth.” Finally, it was argued, “the right of married women to work must be recognized and guaranteed.”<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en167" id="Ref-en167"><sup>33</sup></a> Most of the policy demands were not simply for the betterment of everyday life; their purpose as well was to create the power for an engaged civil society that includes women.</div>
<div class="tx">Of the rights demanded by women to increase their political capacity, much is already familiar from the 1920s onward: cultural rights (the <?dp n="80" folio="59" ?> right to equal and free education being the principle one) and social rights (as listed in the previous paragraph).<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en168" id="Ref-en168"><sup>34</sup></a> A long section of the 1961 Cairo Recommendations on “Equality in the Economic Field” took the point further to argue that if women did not fight for and gain economic rights, they would not be able to be full political citizens. Modern citizenship meant that women should not have to rely on the family unit for their economic well-being but should be full economic partners within the family. The 1957 conference reiterated the slogan “equal pay for equal work,” which reappeared four years later. The 1961 conference offered a detailed vision for feminist struggle in the economic arena, for the right of women to hold any job, gain promotion commensurate to their talents and not gender, have the right to their jobs regardless of pregnancy or convalescence, have vocational and technical training for all types of jobs, and have the right to join and lead trade unions. It demanded that contract work be abolished since such work is frequently done by women, without benefits and out of the clear light of legal regulation. For women agricultural workers, the recommendations called for the “equal distribution of land for those who till it and the guarantee of means of agricultural production.”<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en169" id="Ref-en169"><sup>35</sup></a> Finally, the recommendations included women who do not work for a wage. For them, the conference had two recommendations: that the state try to reduce indirect (sales) taxes on consumer goods and so lighten the burden on household finances, and that the state find ways to give women income support without making them perform meaningless jobs.</div>
<div class="tx">Anticolonial nationalism, even in its reformist incarnations, worried about the woman question. An end to social oppression found its way on to the agenda of national liberation. At its most traditional, such an end looked like the modernization of patriarchy, with the new woman relegated to the domain of the home.<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en170" id="Ref-en170"><sup>36</sup></a> On the more progressive side of national liberation, one finds many who argued that cultural traditions had ossified under the impact of patriarchy and feudal relations, and any opportunity to redress this had been suffocated by imperialism’s alliance with the old social classes, which benefited from misogyny and status. Women and men, in this model, had to struggle against conservative domesticity, and reconfigure what is to be the public space of the nation and the private domain of the family. As the report on social issues put it, women “participate in the struggle for independence of their countries and its maintenance so that they may be able to abolish all customs and traditions which are degradatory to the status of women.”<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en171" id="Ref-en171"><sup>37</sup></a> Third World women’s rights activists sought to reconfigure the nation in their <?dp n="81" folio="60" ?> interest; to them, in the struggle for justice, the nation was more inclusive than the family, and therefore it was within the horizon of anticolonial nationalism that they dreamed and acted.</div>
<div class="tx">Nasserism’s relationship to gender relations shows how even a putatively progressive project is prone to conservatism. What advances came for Egyptian women in the Nasser era, writes political scientist Mervat Hatem, were in the guise of a “state feminism.” The regime “produced women who were economically independent of their families, but dependent on the state for employment, important social services like education, health and day care, and political representation.”<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en172" id="Ref-en172"><sup>38</sup></a> This state feminism opened up some space for women in the domain of politics and the economy (apart from the right to vote, the 1956 Constitution allowed all women the right to education and work). In 1957, two women, Aminah Shukri and Rawiyah ‘Arriyah, won elections to the parliament. Yet the Nasser project remained constrained by social conservatism in terms of its attempt to undermine “personal status laws” and patriarchy. In 1955, the Nasserite regime eliminated the Sharia courts, yet the religious judges remained in newly constituted personal status courts. The weak vanguard within Nasserism remained the Ministry of Social Welfare (led by Hikmat Abu Zeid), which unsuccessfully tried to raise the question of personal laws in the National Assembly in 1958. In the context of state feminism, where some gains had been registered, Abdul-Rahman put her faith in the nation as a political vehicle for the struggle against monarchy, tradition, and empire. Two years after the Cairo conference, the Ministry of Social Welfare took up some of its topics in a conference on women and work, where the theme of women’s economic independence (including in the arena of family planning) dominated. This was an outcome of Cairo, 1961.</div>
<div class="tx">More militant national liberation formations such as the African Party for the Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde (PAIGC) had problems other than that of a neopatriarchal state. They registered the hesitancy of their male comrades toward the reconstruction of the family as an institution. Liberation for women is good theoretically, they allowed, “but in <i>my</i> home? Never!”<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en173" id="Ref-en173"><sup>39</sup></a> Such attitudes did not faze fighters like Teodora Ignacia Gomes, who laid out the logic of women’s rights in the national liberation frame:<div class="atx1"><div class="tx1">First of all, women must fight together with men against colonialism and all systems of exploitation. Secondly, and this is one of the most fundamental points, every woman must convince herself <?dp n="82" folio="61" ?> that she can be free and that she has to be free. And that she is able to do all things that men do in social and political life. And thirdly, women must fight in order to convince men that she has naturally the same rights as he has. But she must understand that the fundamental problem is not the contradiction between women and men, but it is the system in which we are living.<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en174" id="Ref-en174"><sup>40</sup></a></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="tx">The progressive side of anticolonial national liberation not only dreamed of equality but also tried to construct a program for equality based on the history of economic exploitation and cultural suppression. From Buenos Aires came the economist who stitched the economic critiques and anticipations into a doctrine, and it is to him and those who gathered his ideas into action that I now turn.</div>
