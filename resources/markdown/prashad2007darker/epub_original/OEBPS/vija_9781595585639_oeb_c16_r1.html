<b>KINGSTON</b>
<div class="tx1">A hundred years after Christopher Columbus arrived on the island of Jamaica in 1494, the Arawak population of a hundred thousand dwindled to a handful. In time, the entire population was cleansed, and the island was peopled by English colonial officials and plantation owners as well as enslaved Africans and indentured Indians. Captive labor grew the sugarcane that provided the main economic resource of the island. Rebellions came over time, and these generated a strong consciousness of distaste for the brutality and paternalism of colonial rule. It took centuries for independence to come, and when it did come in 1962, it was overdue.</div>
<div class="tx">Just as the abolition of slavery advanced the cause of human freedom and yet left the formerly enslaved people in decrepit socioeconomic conditions, so too did national independence move history forward and yet do little for the everyday dilemmas of Jamaicans.<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en638" id="Ref-en638"><sup>1</sup></a> When the British took down the Union Jack from the island, they could very well have sung the youthful lyrics from Bob Marley’s second album, except that the British didn’t leave much money behind:<div class="atx1"><div class="tx1">I brought the money like your lawyer said to do <br/>Ain’t nothing funny, babe, I am still in love with you <br/>Said I’m leaving you tomorrow <br/>I’ll cause you no more sorrow <br/>One more cup of coffee then I’ll go.</div>

<div class="tx">The new regime of Nelson Manley’s People’s National Party crafted a social development agenda to counter the chainless bondage <?dp n="246" folio="225" ?> of postcolonial life. Drawing from the work of W. Arthur Lewis, a comrade and friend of Prebisch, the Jamaican government pursued the policy of “industrialization by invitation.” A system of leases permitted the government to channel industrial investment into those areas of the economy that allowed for social development.<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en639" id="Ref-en639"><sup>2</sup></a> Economic policy generally drew from the import-substitution theory, and the government relied on targeted direct foreign investment, notably in the bauxite sector. The latter provided Jamaica with most of its foreign exchange earnings. Discovered in the 1940s, the bauxite reserves fell prey to Canadian and U.S. firms starting in 1952. These firms have since dominated the extraction of the mineral, with Jamaica becoming the largest exporter to North America in the 1960s.<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en640" id="Ref-en640"><sup>3</sup></a> But as with sugar and tourism, the Jamaican people did not benefit from their natural resources. The only return to Jamaica came in the way of modest taxes to the government, meager wages to the working class, and a small tribute to the Jamaican managers at the mines and plantations—for this reason, what Jamaica exported despite its fabulous resources was cheap labor, and what it gained for that was a pittance toward its grandiose development aims.<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en641" id="Ref-en641"><sup>4</sup></a></div>
<div class="tx">The Manley-Lewis approach to development resembled in all its essentials the policy followed by most of the formerly colonized states. Unable to draw on foreign capital (the Puerto Rican model) and unwilling to cut off ties with the capitalist world system (the Cuban model), the Manley-Lewis policy hoped to harness whatever domestic funds it could find as well as accumulate state revenues from the sale of bauxite. The capital raised would go toward some measure of social development.</div>
<div class="tx">Indeed, for a formerly colonized state, the Jamaican economy in the two decades after the end of colonial rule grew at a respectable annual rate of 7 percent on average, and per capita income rose by almost 4.5 percent. But because Jamaica’s government had effectively leased its economic sovereignty to the wiles of foreign capital, the growth that the economy experienced was not able to sustain itself. The fundamentals of the economy, like that of much of the Third World, did not befit the rhetoric of freedom.</div>
<div class="tx">Despite the decent rate of growth, Jamaica could not raise the funds to cover its import bill; over 60 percent of the goods used in the country came from abroad (including energy and consumer goods, but also about half its food). Unable to cover its import bill as a result of a failure to diversify its economy, the Jamaican government relied on foreign investment and tourism to balance its books. The erratic, but almost always low prices of its minerals (bauxite) as well as its plantation crops <?dp n="247" folio="226" ?> (bananas and sugar) meant that the balance of payments suffered from a chronic deficit. Loans from commercial banks, sympathetic governments, and international agencies became not an emergency stopgap but a regular budgetary feature. Like many other formerly colonized states, Jamaica came to rely on foreign direct investment not as capital for development or even emergency means but as a routine part of its annual financial policy. Aid became just that: relief to a structurally unbalanced budget. The lack of economic diversification and the use of foreign investment for the repayment of loans instead of social development led to an increase in unemployment from just above 10 percent in 1960 to just under 25 percent by 1972.<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en642" id="Ref-en642"><sup>5</sup></a></div>
<div class="tx">By the early 1970s, the government reactivated its efforts to break Jamaica out of its impoverished chrysalis at the nether end of global capitalism. Manley’s son Michael ran a ferocious and successful political campaign against the global economic system that stacked the decks against countries like Jamaica. Once in power, Michael Manley promoted the construction of democratic socialism for Jamaica, but his regime did not try to disassociate itself from the world capitalist system, or even the overwhelming dominance of financiers of the commercial or IMF variety. Keeping Jamaica hooked up to the infusion of foreign aid or investment meant that the government had to respond to the demands of the foreign money managers rather than the long-term developmental needs of the people of Jamaica. Short-term returns to the investors dominated the planning even of the democratic socialist state.</div>
<div class="tx">The decline in the terms of trade shifted the priorities of the national liberation state; indeed it created a new project for the state—what political scientist Susanne Soederberg calls the “competition state.”<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en643" id="Ref-en643"><sup>6</sup></a> Each state competed with other states to provide the best conditions for private portfolio capital. Because of the general crisis of the domestic economy, its population could not deliver sufficient taxes on its income and profits. This capital infusion, then, was more important to the competition state than its own domestic population. The needs of the investors drove state policy.</div>
<div class="tx">This is not to say that Michael Manley’s regime did nothing to try to promote Jamaican interests.<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en644" id="Ref-en644"><sup>7</sup></a> The administration’s democratic socialist regime initiated a series of measures that challenged the hegemony of the G-7 states, even as it did not demand the structural adjustment of the capitalist order. The first and most impressive move came in the 1974 formation of the International Bauxite Association (IBA). At the founding conference in Conakry, Guinea, seven of the major bauxite producers (Australia, Guinea, Guyana, Jamaica, Sierra Leone, Surinam, and <?dp n="248" folio="227" ?> Yugoslavia) descried the overwhelming domination of “multinational corporations in the exploitation and processing of bauxite and the marketing of its produce.”<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en645" id="Ref-en645"><sup>8</sup></a> Transnational corporations sucked the benefits from the extraction of mineral resources like bauxite. The combined power of the companies worked against the mutual competition between states. Guinea and Jamaica, for instance, competed against each other to the benefit of transnational firms. The IBA wanted the states to shift this power imbalance. If these states operated together, the transnational firms might have to kowtow to them.</div>
<div class="tx">The Manley government sought control over the domestic bauxite industry from a handful of transnational corporations. A substantial levy on the price of the aluminum ingot content in the bauxite drew several hundred million dollars for the treasury in the matter of a few months, and after substantial deliberation the government took over majority (51 percent) control of the bauxite mines.<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en646" id="Ref-en646"><sup>9</sup></a> But control over the domestic production and revenue of bauxite was not sufficient, as the crucial cooperation of the Third World failed to materialize. Brazil did not join the IBA. Australia joined Brazil in selling bauxite for less than the IBA’s agreed price. This destroyed the IBA, which soon became simply an office in Kingston.<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en647" id="Ref-en647"><sup>10</sup></a></div>
<div class="tx">Bauxite was not the only unprocessed commodity to experience a sharp decline in its price into the early 1980s. If the 1970s saw a marginal rise in the price of certain nonpetroleum commodities, by the 1980s there was an across-the-board drop in these prices.<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en648" id="Ref-en648"><sup>11</sup></a> Single commodity export-dependent countries lost earnings of as much as $290 billion between 1980 and 1991 as a result of the decline in their terms of trade. For sub-Saharan Africa, the impact was gruesome. For much of the region, nonfuel primary commodity goods amount for about one-third of the state’s export earnings. The decline in the term of trade meant that these countries lost on average about 5 percent of their gross domestic product, and thereby dampened their state’s budgetary flexibility.<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en649" id="Ref-en649"><sup>12</sup></a> The decline in the terms of trade in the 1980s is not mystical.<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en650" id="Ref-en650"><sup>13</sup></a> It occurred for a variety of reasons. Agriculture in the G-7 states posed a significant problem, as these states both subsidized production and used costly fertilizers and irrigation systems to enhance productivity.</div>
<div class="tx">The bauxite trade was hit hard by shifts in the use of aluminum. Many industries used plastic in its stead, so that in the 1970s Jamaican bauxite exports declined by a third. In this same period, Jamaica’s cane sugar exports declined by 22 percent as the First World market moved toward beet sugar and artificial sweeteners.</div>
<?dp n="249" folio="228" ?><div class="tx">By the end of the 1980s, some commodity cartels remained in business, such as the London-based International Cocoa Organization, but others closed up shop, such as the Association of Coffee Producing Countries, which ended its run in 2002. From the late 1990s onward, the lack of viability of the World Trade Organization to act on behalf of the farmers of the former Third World showed decisively that their prices would remain low as subsidies to the producers in the G-7 remained legal. From bauxite to cotton, farmers and miners in the darker nations faced perilous times.</div>
<div class="tx">Burned by the failure of its cartel maneuver and unwilling to challenge the authority of global capitalism in general, the Manley government also pursued regional cooperation options. Jamaica took a leadership role in moving the Caribbean Community and Common Market (Caricom) from a free trade area into a customs union—that is, from an area without tariffs between the various countries in Caricom to an area with a common external tariff policy against those outside it. The Manley regime initiated a dialogue about the transformation of Caricom into a common market, but it did not go anywhere, Even Caricom failed its self-image as states demanded concessions for their own tariff policies or else cut side deals with the Caribbean Development Bank.<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en651" id="Ref-en651"><sup>14</sup></a> These were difficult times, and the leadership of these nations had no easy choices. They stumbled around in search of a way out of the debt trap, and even those such as Cuba only managed with considerable assistance from the already-faltering Soviet economy.<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en652" id="Ref-en652"><sup>15</sup></a></div>
<div class="tx">In the early years of Michael Manley’s democratic socialism experiment, Jamaica’s main reggae artist became the voice of the Third World. In 1973, Marley and the Wailers released <i>Burnin’</i>, their second major international hit after the previous year’s <i>Catch a Fire</i>. On this album, the Wailers produced a series of songs that reflected the rage of those who began to feel increasingly marginalized by their own state and the international order: “Get Up, Stand Up,” “I Shot the Sheriff,” “Burnin’ and Lootin’,” and “Oppressed Song.”<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en653" id="Ref-en653"><sup>16</sup></a> One of them, the title track, set the tone with regard to the difficulty of finding the “boss” who controlled the system of everyday economic curfews:<div class="atx1"><div class="tx1">This morning I woke up in a curfew. <br/>Oh God, I was a prisoner too. <br/>Could not recognize the faces standing over me. <br/>They were all dressed in uniforms of brutality. <br/>How many rivers do we have to cross, <?dp n="250" folio="229" ?> <br/>Before we can talk to the boss? <br/>All that we got, it seems we have lost, <br/>We must have really paid the cost.</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="tx">And then, because of the structural failure of the Third World agenda,<div class="atx1"><div class="tx1">That’s why we gonna be <br/>Burnin’ and lootin’ tonight . . . <br/>Burnin’ all illusions tonight.</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="tx">By 1976, the Jamaican balance of payments registered a deficit (in Jamaican dollars) of $231.3 million, and the net foreign exchange reserves fell precipitously from a positive balance of $136.7 million in June 1975 to a negative one of $181.4 million in December 1976. World inflation, high oil prices, and a drop in commodity prices effected the reserves, as it did those of most of the darker nations. In 1960, the total debt of the 133 states that the World Bank counted as part of the “developing countries” held a total public and private debt just short of US$18 billion. In ten years, the debt had escalated to $75 billion, and when Jamaica went into fiscal crisis, it was $113 billion. By 1982, the debt had reached the astronomical figure of $612 billion. While many scholars and commentators blame the oil crisis of 1973–74 for the ballooning debt, this is a superficial argument. The rise in oil prices due to the action of the OPEC cartel only exacerbated tendencies that had already stymied the social development of the formerly colonized states. The distorted development agenda followed by most of the Third World, whether those that adopted or shunned socialism, and the imperialist pressure faced by these states produced a structurally impoverished international political economy. When the oil crisis hit, it provided the conjuncture for the Third World’s structural rot.</div>
<div class="tx">Many of the states mired in debt struggled to raise funds. As the NIEO strategy faltered, the Third World states turned to commercial banks to cover their debt. Borrowing without any ability to pay back the loans and the interest was the precipitating cause of the debt crisis for the Third World. In 1974–75, the nonpetroleum exporting states of the Third World had to come up with $80 billion to finance their external deficits. Of this, about $36 billion came from private sources.<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en654" id="Ref-en654"><sup>17</sup></a> Commercial banks in the G-7 that found that the rate of return within the advanced industrial states declined as productivity rates grew flat, turned eagerly to fund the Third World states. They divided the “emerging <?dp n="251" folio="230" ?> markets” into at least two categories: the “fast-growing exporters of manufactures” such as Brazil, the Philippines, and South Korea, and the “new rich commodity exporters” such as copper exporters Peru and Zambia, and even Zaire (copper, cobalt, and manganese). But the banks would not dole out their capital without cover from the IMF.<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en655" id="Ref-en655"><sup>18</sup></a> If the IMF sanctified the state with a short-term standby agreement, it provided a “seal of approval” for more funds. The IMF loans often fell far short of the amount needed, so the IMF acted as insurance for the private commercial banks. U.S. banks took the lead. For example, as the economist Emma Rothschild notes, twenty-one of the largest U.S. banks lent in excess of $5 billion to Brazil and Mexico each. The money swept into the Third World, but not without a prospect of return. In 1975, Rothschild reports, “each of the five largest U.S. banks made more than 40 percent of its profits from foreign operations. Chase was an extreme case. It earned 64 percent of its profits abroad, as compared to only 22 percent in 1970.”<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en656" id="Ref-en656"><sup>19</sup></a></div>
<div class="tx">These commercial banks made a prudent decision. Their investment in the structural poverty of the Third World’s balance-of-payments debt crisis paid handsome returns. But the situation seemed illogical. How could the impoverished pay back these enormous loans? Even the capitalist press worried for the profligate banks. “It doesn’t show on any maps,” <i>Wall Street Journal</i> editors quipped, “but there’s a new mountain on the planet—a towering $500 billion of debt run up by the developing countries.” Because the situation “looks starkly ominous” to some, the paper continued, it might create a chain reaction of defaults and bank failures that resembles the major depression of the 1930s. It takes a lot for the booster of free market capital to drum up such a pessimistic outlook.</div>
<div class="tx">The defaults did not come because the IMF, backed by the U.S. government and the newly confident elites of the darker nations, strong-armed governments into the cannibalization of their resources to maintain the payment schedules. After the Mexican collapse of 1982, the U.S. government proposed the Brady Plan (1989), which had two elements. First, the banks lent money to cover the debt if the country provided assurances to pay back the loan and the debt, and second, the IMF and the U.S. Department of the Treasury sanctified the loan if the country entered a process of significant economic reform. These reforms were planned to construct competition states and cut down the elements of the responsive state created by the national liberation regimes.</div>
<div class="tx">The indebted states could not fully or finally pay back the loaned amounts because they did not have the structural capacity to raise their <?dp n="252" folio="231" ?> exports above their imports, nor could they claw back from the devaluations of their local currencies that resulted as part of the IMF package. <a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en657" id="Ref-en657"><sup>20</sup></a> Nevertheless, they serviced their debts with an annual interest payment either raised through more credit or else through the diversion of the surplus that might have gone toward social welfare (health, education, and other such areas of the social wage).</div>
<div class="tx">By 1983, capital flows reversed, as more money came from the indebted states to the G-7 than went out as loans and aid. In other words, the indebted countries subsidized and funded the wealthy nations. In the late 1980s, the indebted states sent an average of $40 billion more to the G-7 than the G-7 sent out as loans and aid; this became the annual tribute from the darker nations. By 1997, the total debt owed by the formerly colonized world amounted to about $2.17 trillion, with a daily debt-service payment of $717 million. The nations of sub-Saharan Africa spent four times more on debt service, on interest payments, than on health care. For most of the indebted states, between one-third and one-fifth of their gross national product was squandered in this debt-service tribute. The debt crisis had winners: the financial interests in the G-7.</div>
<div class="tx">If the G-7 commercial banks gained from the loans they continued to extend to the new indebted world, they did not win alone. To blame the oil crisis of 1973–74 for the implosion disguises another beneficiary of the rise in oil prices. During the first six months of 1974, when the fiscal effects of the oil crisis became clear, the G-7 enjoyed a $6 billion surplus with the nonpetroleum exporting Third World states, but it suffered a $41 billion deficit with the oil exporting states. A year later, the nonpetroleum states owed $21 billion, whereas the G-7 owed the oil group $21 billion. <a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en658" id="Ref-en658"><sup>21</sup></a> The scale had been balanced. The rise in oil revenue for the G-7 had been offset by the surplus owed by the oil-less Third World. Furthermore, the oil states, as we saw earlier, held their profits largely in U.S. dollars, which meant that as the U.S. dollar abandoned the gold standard in 1971, its own standing in the global economy remained high because petrodollars kept it in demand.<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en659" id="Ref-en659"><sup>22</sup></a> The rise in petrodollars allowed the United States to abandon the very macroeconomic restrictions it demanded of the Third World, and therefore run a deficit to strengthen its domestic economy and expand its already-considerable military.</div>
<div class="tx">The debt crisis and the general disunity in the Third World over its response to this predicament offered an opening to the G-7 and its international agencies, notably the IMF, to demand immense concessions from the indebted states. The debt crisis was the Trojan horse for an assault against the abbreviated project for the construction of Third World sovereignty. <?dp n="253" folio="232" ?> The IMF did not provide short-term assistance without prejudice. At its founding meeting in 1944, the Indian delegation proposed that the IMF should “assist in the fuller utilization of the resources of economically underdeveloped countries.” The principle powers (led by the United States) rejected this formulation. For them, the IMF should simply be an instrument to ensure that countries in debt be encouraged with loans to cover their deficit rather than erect trade barriers to shore up their economy. The IMF, for the United States particularly, would be one more instrument to maintain a tariff-free capitalist system. As Article 1, no. 5 put it, the IMF would “give confidence to members by making the general resources of the Fund temporarily available to them under adequate safeguards, thus providing them with opportunity to correct maladjustments in their balance of payments without resorting to measures destructive of national or international prosperity.” India’s proposal aimed to extend the IMF’s ambit from monetary policy and macroeconomic stabilization to the development needs of the emergent Third World. This could not be allowed for an institution intended to teach the world the fundamentals of neoclassic, free market economics.<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en660" id="Ref-en660"><sup>23</sup></a> IMF policy not only encouraged the export of capital but also drove the export of the capitalist relations of production to the darker nations.</div>
<div class="tx">In 1954, the government of Peru came to the IMF for a short-term loan. The IMF did not provide the loan with the hope that Peru’s government would make good use of it. Instead, the IMF demanded one condition: that Peru’s economy must maintain a stable exchange rate. Gradually the IMF created procedures for accountability and punishment, generally as a poor report against the country that might lead to a dearth of commercial finance. States outside the G-7 that took IMF money had to submit to a total makeover of their political and economic relations. In March 1980, the World Bank would give these sorts of policies a name, “Structural Adjustment loan,” which would soon be called the Structural Adjustment Policy (SAP). Jamaica and other countries in the 1970s had to submit to SAP loans avant la lettre.</div>
<div class="tx">In December 1976, as Marley took the stage at Kingston’s National Heroes Park for his Smile Jamaica concert, Manley’s government acceded to the IMF.<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en661" id="Ref-en661"><sup>24</sup></a> <div class="atx1"><div class="tx1">We’re gonna help our people, help them right. <br/>O Lord, help us tonight. <br/>Cast away that evil spell, throw some water in the well, and smile <br/>In Jamaica, c’mon and smile <?dp n="254" folio="233" ?></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="tx">The IMF plan was rigorous. First, it called on the government to devalue its currency to discourage imports and increase its ability to export its products. The policy intended to shift the import-substitution thrust to an export-oriented economy. Second, the government had to discourage an increase in wages to keep down the need to import goods. Third, the IMF called for the reduction of state expenditure and a contraction of the role of the state in the economy (no more price controls and subsidies). Fourth, the state needed to sell off its public-sector assets and enhance the private enterprises. Finally, the state had to hamper the money supply and raise interest rates to induce “fiscal discipline.” If Marley asked Jamaica to smile in late 1976, a few months earlier his wife, Rita, wrote a different song. “Them crazy,” she wrote in a song that Bob sang in the summer. “Them crazy. We gonna chase those crazy baldheads out of town.... Here comes the con man, coming with his con plan.... We gonna chase those crazy . . . baldheads out of town.”</div>
<div class="tx">The IMF arrived with one prescription to fit all ailments, whether in Jamaica in 1976 or Sudan and Zaire in 1979, and elsewhere.<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en662" id="Ref-en662"><sup>25</sup></a> The elements of IMF policy included such items as a tighter money supply, a devalued currency, high interest rates, reduced governmental expenditure, lower wages, and an assault on tariffs and subsidies. The logic of the social wage gave way to that of austerity. The IMF urged the indebted nations to submit themselves to complete integration in the world capitalist system, and not try to create either autarkic modes of economic protection or even reforms to privilege domestic development. Rather than deal with the short-term balance-of-payments crisis for what it was, the IMF in the 1970s used the financial crisis as the means to demand deep shifts in the political and economic arrangements devised by the Third World. In other words, the IMF went after every policy initiated by its fellow international agency, UNCTAD. Rather than consider that the problem of debt stemmed from the dilemma of mono-export economies, capital-starved former colonies, or unfinished class struggles within the Third World, the IMF put the problem on the nature of the state. The IMF rebuked the fact that the Third World state attempted to engineer development, indeed that it took on the role of surplus management.</div>
<div class="tx">In Jamaica, the immediate effects of IMF policy fell on the rural and urban working class. Inflation soared as the Jamaican dollar faced significant devaluation and prices of basic goods began to skyrocket (chicken up 74 percent, salt-fish 285 percent, milk 83 percent, flour 214 percent, and cooking oil 71 percent).<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en663" id="Ref-en663"><sup>26</sup></a> The IMF austerity regime dropped real wages by as much as 35 percent in 1978 alone. By 1980, the unemployment rate <?dp n="255" folio="234" ?> in Jamaica soared to 30 percent or perhaps more. About 60 percent of Jamaican households began to rely primarily, if not exclusively, on the income of women, many of whom worked in unrewarding sweatshops in Kingston’s free trade zone. In that zone, 80 percent of the employees were single mothers whose desperation to keep their families alive meant that three-quarters of them worked overtime.<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en664" id="Ref-en664"><sup>27</sup></a> One of these women, Debbie, told a 1988 surveyor that she earned $30 every two weeks, and “when it comes time for my draw down, I put it into the Credit Union and try to keep it for utility bills. But I’m always behind. Sometimes I have to do without light or water or gas and beg my neighbours until I can catch up.” When Debbie was not able to work overtime, she had to join the higglers (the female street vendors): “I go to the market with a few dollars to buy essentials like seasonings, callaloo (greens) and the cheapest fruits. I go later in the day when the prices are lower; I check prices and haggle. It takes a lot of energy.” Journalist Joan Ross Frankson, who reported this survey, offers her summary: “By imposing structural adjustment policies on Jamaica the World Bank and its IMF partner have reversed the old rule about women and children being saved first. In this harsh new ocean there are no lifeboats—and women and children must simply sink or swim.”<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en665" id="Ref-en665"><sup>28</sup></a></div>
<div class="tx">Jamaica’s problems with IMF policies mimicked what had occurred elsewhere. The UN Development Program as well as other agencies recorded their own doubts almost as soon as the IMF began to structurally adjust the national liberation state.<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en666" id="Ref-en666"><sup>29</sup></a> There were even doubters within the IMF. In 1990, a senior IMF economist studied the IMF-ENFORCED stabilization measures from 1973 to 1988, the period when the structural adjustment bombed the Third World. His measured study found that “the growth rate is significantly reduced in program countries relative to the change in non-program countries.”<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en667" id="Ref-en667"><sup>30</sup></a> The IMF medication produced a patient with contracted economic activity, the destruction of the capacity for long-term economic growth, the cannibalization of resources (what is known as “asset stripping”), and a consequent return to being an exporter of raw materials. Much of this resulted in rising inequality in terms of class and gender, in addition to widespread environmental devastation.</div>
<div class="tx">In the 1960s, the Third World states organized into UNCTAD had pledged not to attack the already-strained consumption ability of their citizens. Funds for development could not be garnered from additional taxation, these states promised, because they would not be able to draw more from a relatively impoverished population. After two decades, <?dp n="256" folio="235" ?> when the IMF era eroded the sovereignty of the national liberation states, it became routine to demand that these hollow states now pound more and more surplus from their exhausted populations to pay back already-fattened commercial banks and international agencies. Macroeconomic stability became a more important actor on the world stage than the citizens of the national liberation states. In 1977, Michael Manley complained, “We cannot continue to be told that the price of balance of payments support through the IMF may involve measures that cause mass starvation.”<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en668" id="Ref-en668"><sup>31</sup></a> If Manley worried about the ability of the working class to survive, the IMF took a harsh approach to sacrifice. In 1981, IMF director Jacques de Lavosiere called for “sacrifices on the part of all: international financing will serve no purpose if spent on consumption as if there were no tomorrow.”<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en669" id="Ref-en669"><sup>32</sup></a></div>
<div class="tx">Sacrifices could not be demanded without the expectation that they would result in protest. Early victims of IMF policies vigorously battled their governments for their accession to the IMF conditions. From Egypt to Peru, Sudan to Ecuador, Bolivia to Liberia—the streets of the Third World rang with the cries of “The Poor Can’t Take No More” (as street graffiti in Kingston put it).</div>
<div class="atx1"><div class="tx1">Come we go burn down Babylon one more time <br/>Come we go chant down Babylon one more time . . . <br/>Men see their dreams and aspirations crumble in front of their face <br/>And all their wicked intentions to destroy the human race . . . <br/>Come we go chant down Babylon one more time.</div>
</div>
<div class="tx">Babylon knew that its demands would not come without a response. In early 1980, the Independent Commission for International Developmental Issues, chaired by the former socialist chancellor of West Germany Willy Brandt, published “North-South: A Program for Survival,” which became known as the Brandt Report. The report had been commissioned by the World Bank’s Robert McNamara to find out why the process known as “development” had failed to produce justice. Toward the end of the report the commission noted, “The Fund’s insistence on drastic measures has tended to impose unnecessary and unacceptable political burdens on the poorest, on occasion leading to ‘IMF riots’ and even downfall of governments.”<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en670" id="Ref-en670"><sup>33</sup></a> Jamaica had both these riots and the downfall of its government. The Manley government could have disavowed the IMF demands, refused to cover its deficit, and turned to Cuba and others for assistance. But this was a dangerous strategy given <?dp n="257" folio="236" ?> the overwhelmingly military response that would have come from the United States (as the Nicaraguans found after the successful Sandinista revolution of 1979, and as the Cubans continued to experience). Instead, Michael Manley accepted the IMF funds and tried to ameliorate its demands, to produce structural adjustment with a human face. Manley objected to the IMF’s demand that the state cut its social programs, as this was “the price of survival for the democratic system.”<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en671" id="Ref-en671"><sup>34</sup></a> Of course the IMF did not budge and the Manley government’s budget had to give, and give again. As Manley hesitated, the commercial banks refused to proffer loans. When these came, the conditions were onerous. By the end of 1980, the per capita income in Jamaica fell by 40 percent.</div>
<div class="tx">This pressure and the unemployment not only damaged the credibility of the Manley government but also called into question the viability of democratic socialism, or indeed any alternative to capitalism. As economist Richard Bernal noted, “The [IMF’s] actions and programs gave credibility to the charge that the government was guilty of economic mismanagement and that democratic socialism was impractical and unworkable.”<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en672" id="Ref-en672"><sup>35</sup></a> IMF-led globalization promotes the view that the national liberation state is an overbearing and inefficient institution. Rather than allow the state to determine and regulate the process of the economy, IMF policies uphold “market forces” or the “market” as the most efficient agent for economic activity. When the IMF officials told the Jamaicans that politics should be taken out of the market, what they meant, Bernal underscored, was that the state should abdicate its formal accountable role in the management of the social surplus. The market will take care of everything.</div>
<div class="tx">Manley called for an election. He wanted to make it a mandate against the IMF and its prescriptions. This was always a tough sell, because it is hard to make abstract domination a coherent, emotive election issue. The opposition led by Edward Seaga’s pro–United States Jamaican Labour Party was able to make the election turn on the current state of the economy, rather than the external pressures from IMF-DRIVEN globalization. Things looked bad for Manley. On the streets of Kingston, the wall painters wrote, “IMF = Is Manley’s Fault.”<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en673" id="Ref-en673"><sup>36</sup></a> Eight hundred people died in this most contentious and violent election. Seaga rode to victory.</div>
<div class="tx">Seaga inherited a broken economy. His party crafted the <i>National Programme for Reconstruction</i>, including the rebuilding of parts of the public sector.<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en674" id="Ref-en674"><sup>37</sup></a> When Manley spoke of the public sector, the U.S. government rebuked him; when Seaga did, they championed his leadership <?dp n="258" folio="237" ?> in the rebuilding of necessary infrastructure. The difference was political. A pro-Atlantic Jamaica could be a counterpoint to insurgent Nicaragua and Grenada as well as Cuba. In the same way, on the Pacific Rim, the U.S. government funded dictatorships in Indonesia and the Philippines despite the “nationalist” noises by Suharto and Marcos. Suharto declared 1966 to be the “Year of Self-Reliance,” and threatened to nationalize the oil industry. Suharto’s economic program included a cocktail of import substitution, industrialization by invitation, and an open door to the extraction sector (U.S.-based Caltex held a commanding position in oil, while U.S.-based Freeport-McMoran dominated copper). As long as Suharto facilitated the work of the transnational corporations and joined the United States in a geopolitical alliance, all else was forgiven.<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en675" id="Ref-en675"><sup>38</sup></a> Marcos, in 1973, ordained a constitution that reneged on the open-door policy for U.S. firms, yet he allowed these same firms through the back door with “service contracts.” Additionally, Marcos signed Presidential Decree no. 66 to create the Bataan Export Processing Zone (EPZ); foreign-owned firms in this EPZ received enormous tax exemptions and repatriated their profits.<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en676" id="Ref-en676"><sup>39</sup></a> This was a harbinger of Marcos’s export-oriented industrialization strategy, one welcomed by the U.S. treasury and the G-7. Seaga, too, spoke publicly about the need for an efficient public sector at the same time as he encouraged the two major bauxite transnational firms (Kaiser and Reynolds) to expand their operations on the island. Marcos, Suharto, and Seaga mastered the art of political illusion: by a sleight of hand, they posed as efficient nationalists as they opened their countries to unregulated corporations. The national bourgeoisie, represented in Jamaica by Seaga, camouflaged their enthusiasm for “reform” by making the claim that there is no alternative and the IMF made us do it as well as by touting the amount of U.S. and IMF money that flowed into the country as a result of the reforms.</div>
<div class="tx">Proximity to the Pentagon and the U.S. White House enabled such states to gain financial benefits. The U.S. government poured money into Jamaica: US$100 million per year in cash, and the purchase of millions of tons of bauxite for its “strategic stockpile.”<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en677" id="Ref-en677"><sup>40</sup></a> In addition, the U.S. treasury vouched for these states with the international agencies, such as the IMF and other commercial and development banks. Short-term capital flooded in on very favorable terms. That the U.S. government dominated the IMF by dint of its contribution to the total fund and that it, along with the four other advanced industrial states (the United Kingdom, France, Germany, and Japan), controlled the World Bank, <?dp n="259" folio="238" ?> allowed it to have an inordinate control over the decisions of these crucial bodies.<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en678" id="Ref-en678"><sup>41</sup></a> The IMF provided Seaga’s Jamaica with $600 million between 1981 and 1983 to underwrite the reform process. This inflow of capital did not prevent the free flow of the Jamaican economy. In 1981, the island’s gross domestic product was $3 billion, but three years later it fell to $2 billion (the per capita annual income also dropped from $1,340 to $923). IMF-driven globalization exacerbated the collapse of the Jamaican economy, overseen by its great ally, Seaga. In 1984, an IMF riot broke out in Kingston. Eleven people died.</div>
<div class="tx">The institutional impact of IMF-driven globalization was heavy. The new reforms pushed by Seaga’s government resulted in a weakened responsive state. Between the mid-1980s and 1989, Jamaica’s government fired about a third of its public employees “both through privatization of public companies and through central government layoffs.”<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en679" id="Ref-en679"><sup>42</sup></a> The state hired fewer people, had fewer regulators of the market, and therefore had little capacity to discharge its constitutional responsibilities. Not only did the IMF-driven reforms call for privatization and disinvestment in the economy, it also insisted on the withdrawal of the state from any interference in the management of social wealth (through a redistribution of food or via welfare) and the regulation of economic activities. The national liberation state was disemboweled in this process.<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en680" id="Ref-en680"><sup>43</sup></a></div>
<div class="tx">The withdrawal of the neoliberal, competition state from the provision of social welfare and the protection of sovereignty did not mean that all the state institutions were weakened.<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en681" id="Ref-en681"><sup>44</sup></a> The neoliberal state now stakes itself more on repression than on responsiveness. Its role is as a crime fighter and a warrior against subversion. The assaults on the “rude bwoys” and Rastafarians predated Seaga’s rule, but intensified within it. In 1980, the Private Sector Organization of Jamaica hosted Seaga’s attorney general and minister of national security, Winston Spaulding, as well as the chief of staff of the Jamaican Defense Force brigadier Robert Neish and the police commissioner Wilbert Bowes. Spaulding reported that crime was intolerable, and to take care of it the police must “be free to go out there and get the gunmen.” Seaga’s cabinet backed the security forces entirely.<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en682" id="Ref-en682"><sup>45</sup></a> From 1979 to 1986, the Jamaican police killed more than two hundred people per year. An Americas Watch report summarized the police strategy as “a practice of summary executions by the police; a practice of unlawful detentions by the police at times accompanied by police assaults on detainees; and a practice of confining detainees in police station lock-ups under squalid and degrading conditions.”<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en683" id="Ref-en683"><sup>46</sup></a> In the conditions of total social and economic collapse, <?dp n="260" folio="239" ?> gang violence or community protection against gang violence became the order of the day. Social anomie intensified alongside IMF-driven reforms, and the neoliberal state responded with the bullet.<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en684" id="Ref-en684"><sup>47</sup></a></div>
<div class="tx">The armed forces not only went after the discarded parts of the Jamaican population but also used the right of eminent domain to expel people from their land. In the 1970s, the major bauxite firms took charge of almost two hundred thousand acres of farmland and displaced hundreds of thousands of farmers. These farmers “watched helplessly as the transnational firms bulldozed their homes and small provision grounds to take out the red dirt from the ground, sending this dirt to the sea on conveyor belts, where ships could carry them to provide jobs in the aluminum industry in Europe and North America.”<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en685" id="Ref-en685"><sup>48</sup></a> The ejected farmers either went overseas and remitted money to distraught relatives, or they turned to the increasingly lucrative marijuana trade.</div>
<div class="tx">The state’s withdrawal of regulation left the transnational corporation without any check. The mysteries of fiscal policy devalued the role of the citizen (with rights in the state) and elevated the power of the foreign corporations. In 1960, a U.S. scholar defined transnational corporations as entities “which have their home in one country but which operate and live under the laws of other countries as well.”<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en686" id="Ref-en686"><sup>49</sup></a> This definition, however, missed one of the most crucial dynamics of the transnational corporation: to abjure jurisdictions and laws—in sum, to operate outside regulation and oversight. Carl Gerstacker of Dow Chemicals wistfully told the White House Conference on the Industrial World on February 7, 1972, “I have long dreamed of buying an island owned by no nation and of putting the world headquarters of the Dow Company on the truly neutral ground of such an island, beholden to no nation or society.”<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en687" id="Ref-en687"><sup>50</sup></a> What Gerstacker hoped for did not come in the form that he desired (an island) but in the power that the transnational corporations wielded as a result of the demotion of the national liberation states. As such states withdrew from the task of economic regulation and the management of the surplus, transnational corporations filled the vacuum.<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en688" id="Ref-en688"><sup>51</sup></a> Of course the national bourgeoisie of these states, themselves children of two or more decades of import substitution or else the state bureaucracy, not only welcomed the transnational firms but also went into joint ventures with them or else went to work for them. The transnational corporation did not threaten the sovereignty of the national liberation state; that had already occurred through the impact of IMF-led globalization.<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en689" id="Ref-en689"><sup>52</sup></a></div>
<div class="tx">The transnational corporations that blossomed from the 1970s onward emerged only because of a tremendous transformation of technology. <?dp n="261" folio="240" ?> The fragmentation of the production process allowed firms to disarticulate the factory and shift parts of what was once a centralized assembly line across continents. This could only take place alongside the development of a communications network (via satellites), a transportation network (computerized shipping, containerization, and lower air freight costs), an international accounting and credit system (cash management through computers), and weaker international taxes on the transit of partially finished goods. All these developments allowed for the integration of production on a world scale. When national liberation states shifted their priorities from import-substitution, people-oriented development toward export-led, growth-driven development, they created EPZs that cut taxes and defended corporations against all regulation. Jamaica’s Kingston EPZ used to be a warehousing and transshipment facility. In 1982, the state converted it into a production site, and soon thereafter added the Montego Bay EPZ (1985) and the Garmex EPZ (1987). Technological changes and the encouragement of the formerly colonized states through a withdrawal of laws enabled the transnational corporation to flourish.<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en690" id="Ref-en690"><sup>53</sup></a> In 1980, a study of the world’s hundred-largest economic units found that thirty-nine of them were not states but transnational corporations.<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en691" id="Ref-en691"><sup>54</sup></a></div>
<div class="tx">The more astute movements recognized the power of transnational corporations. After Chile’s socialist president Allende nationalized the country’s copper mines, he asked the UN Economic and Social Council to investigate the activities of global corporations. In 1973, after Allende’s ouster and murder, the United Nations created the Centre on Transnational Corporations (UNCTC). Following a long period of deliberation and study, the UNCTC drafted a provisional transnational corporation code of conduct in 1976, but after dozens of consultations and meetings, the code died when the United Nations closed down UNCTC in 1993.<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en692" id="Ref-en692"><sup>55</sup></a> The UNCTC created an archive on corporate malfeasance and the fiscal irregularities due to a lack of international standards for accounting. All the principles and procedures being produced by the UNCTC would have posed a great challenge to the kind of fallacious operations maintained by Enron.<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en693" id="Ref-en693"><sup>56</sup></a> Over the course of the 1980s and into the 1990s, the UNCTC played a quixotic role, as the G-7 powers took advantage of the Third World’s collapse to exert the power of the transnational corporation into the bureaucratic world of the United Nations. By February 9, 1998, when UN secretary general Annan signed a joint statement with the International Chamber of Commerce (represented by leaders from Coca-Cola, Goldman Sachs, McDonald’s, <?dp n="262" folio="241" ?> Rio Tinto Zinc, and Unilever) that read, “Broad political and economic changes have opened up new opportunities for dialogue and cooperation between the United Nations and the private sector,” the advantage went decisively to IMF-led globalization over the Third World. Furthermore, the statement hoped that the United Nations and the International Chamber of Commerce would “forge a close global partnership to secure greater business input into the world’s economic decision-making and boost the private sector in the least developed countries.” What they wanted was the establishment of “an effective regulatory framework for globalization,” or in other words, as little influence as possible in the capitalist relations of production.<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en694" id="Ref-en694"><sup>57</sup></a> This convergence effected the UNCTAD, the new home of the UNCTC.</div>
<div class="tx">When the UNCTC went to the UNCTAD, it became a part of the Division of Investment, Technology, and Enterprise Development—in other words, it became a cheerleader for transnational corporations. The UNCTAD, born by the efforts of the Third World, now produces investment guides for global conglomerates so that they can have “comparative information on investment opportunities” in the “least developed countries” (this is a project with the International Chamber of Commerce).<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en695" id="Ref-en695"><sup>58</sup></a> The UNCTAD is now a booster of trade within the current unfair structure of the international political economy, not the heart of the international struggle led by the Third World to challenge and change the structure itself. Where Prebisch called for a revision of the terms of trade and outright grants instead of loans, the current head of the UNCTAD, Rubens Ricupero, asks for an increase in the volume of trade alone. “Many poor countries run big balance of payments deficits, usually filled by aid flows and remittances from overseas,” he told the 2004 UNCTAD conference. “A major aim of all least developed countries should be to reduce their aid dependence and external indebtedness.” All this is along the grain of the old UNCTAD, but how does change happen? “Capital accumulation and trade are the engine of growth, and international trade is the fuel for the engine. If the fuel dries up, the engine will not run.”<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en696" id="Ref-en696"><sup>59</sup></a> What the darker nations must do is to increase their exports within a structure that pays too little for them (terms of trade) or does not value their inputs (labor).</div>
<div class="tx">The demise of democratic socialism in the late 1970s had immense sociopolitical ramifications. During the 1970s, the Jamaican women’s movement, mainly exercised through the democratic socialist political party, grew in strength.<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en697" id="Ref-en697"><sup>60</sup></a> After Manley’s regime took power, the Women’s Auxiliary of his party pushed a strong transformative <?dp n="263" folio="242" ?> agenda. The government felt the pressure, created the Women’s Bureau in the Prime Minister’s Office, and championed legislation to benefit women especially. When confronted with high female unemployment, Manley’s government passed the Special Employment (or Crash) Programme to hire women to conduct public works. A backyard day care initiative and free educational services (including school meals and uniforms) freed up household budgets. Better minimum wage laws, equal pay rules, and a campaign against the concept of the illegitimacy of children rounded out the array of laws and rules. When the political and economic situation worsened in 1977, the Women’s Auxiliary joined with the Marxist Committee of Women for Progress to create the Joint Committee for Women’s Rights. This new forum pushed a maternity leave law, fought against price increases, and exposed cases of hoarding by markets. In this period, the campaign for women’s liberation had an agenda and an organization. But with the IMF-led reforms, this dynamic collapsed. The state no longer provided an avenue for building the power of working-class women. The political organizations withered, or turned elsewhere for funds and support.</div>
<div class="tx">This elsewhere is significant. Private foundations in the Atlantic states came forward to provide small amounts of funds to those organizations that weathered the demise of the state’s responsiveness. Some of these groups took over the state’s function to provide the basic amenities of survival (health care, literacy, and sustenance). The World Bank lauded them for doing what the national liberation state did routinely.<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en698" id="Ref-en698"><sup>61</sup></a> The groups that pushed for systematic change or had strong political views had their funding cut. Sistren, a political and cultural outfit in Jamaica, started out in the 1970s as a beneficiary of the democratic socialist regime. When that fell apart, it was able to continue only because of North American foundation money. One of its leaders, Honor Ford-Smith, recalls how the Inter-American Foundation ceased funding Sistren when it insisted on joining an “unacceptable political” activity, an antiapartheid rally.<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en699" id="Ref-en699"><sup>62</sup></a> The Jamaican women’s movement and the Women’s Bureau of the democratically socialist state pushed a slew of laws to transform the social condition of women. These new groups could not exercise this sort of leverage. They were only able to offer support or express their discontent. The institutional apparatus within the state to carry forward the women’s liberation agenda no longer existed.<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en700" id="Ref-en700"><sup>63</sup></a></div>
<div class="tx">In 1979, scholars and politicians from around the Third World met in Kingston for an international conference on the trauma of the planet’s political economy. The gathering produced “The Terra Nova Statement <?dp n="264" folio="243" ?> on the International Monetary System and the Third World.” If the IMF put itself forward as an unblemished institution of global reform, those in Kingston saw it as an instrument for the perpetuation of inequality. The G-7 dominated the IMF procedures and policies, and regarded its rules as being for the darker nations and not for the advanced industrial states. For this reason, the G-7 did not adhere to the IMF structural adjustment demands against budget deficits and subsidies. The G-7 broke the rules when it wanted to and treated “the Fund with impunity when they wished.”<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en701" id="Ref-en701"><sup>64</sup></a> The IMF served the G-7, and not the G-77. That was the lesson of “The Terra Nova Statement.”</div>
<div class="tx">The statement showed that whereas almost a hundred Third World states accounted for less than 37 percent of the IMF’s voting power, the five leading industrial powers controlled more than 40 percent, while the United States alone held 20 percent of the votes in the IMF. The fund was controlled by the United States and other advanced industrial states. Indeed, the U.S. government was fully aware of this, pointing out to itself that it would only promote the policies of these international bodies if “we are capable and willing to pursue important policy objectives in the banks by exercising the leverage at our disposal.”<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en702" id="Ref-en702"><sup>65</sup></a> “The Terra Nova Statement” said that “the IMF, acting on behalf of the major industrialized capitalist countries, has assumed a growing role as a financial and economic policeman in Third World countries.”<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en703" id="Ref-en703"><sup>66</sup></a></div>
<div class="tx">The Third World, in crisis, offered a variety of reforms for the world political economy, but few listened. At Terra Nova itself, the delegates recognized that major “internal structural reforms” were needed, such as tight capital controls, control over foreign trade, and better management of local production. None of this came in line with IMF-LED globalization, and most of this would be outlined at the South-North Conference on the International Monetary System and the New International Order in Arusha, Tanzania (June–July 1980). “The Arusha Initiative,” like “The Terra Nova Statement,” understood that the IMF had compromised its integrity by a too-close relationship with the G-7. The G-77 needed to reform the IMF to make it “supportive of a process of global development, especially for the countries of the Third World, which contain the majority of the world’s poor.” A new international monetary policy that could do this would need to achieve monetary stability, restore reasonable levels of employment and sustainable growth, and check inflation in the world economy.<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en704" id="Ref-en704"><sup>67</sup></a> To do this, the IMF would have to curtail the immense power of the G-7 to dominate production and prices, exchange rates, and world trade.</div>
<?dp n="265" folio="244" ?><div class="tx">From such principled objections and objectives, “The Arusha Initiative” laid out four “main attributes of a new monetary system”:<div class="liste"><div class="lsl1">(1) Democratic management and control, or in fact the rearrangement of the policy that allows the largest donor to have the greatest say (as in the IMF);</div><div class="lsl1">(2) Universality, or a demand that all states participate in international agreements;</div><div class="lsl1">(3) The establishment of an international currency unit as the means of exchange and as the primary reserve asset, this to circumvent the global power of the dollar;</div><div class="lsl1">(4) Immediate “resource transfer” to undo the vast imbalance in the world system.</div></div></div>
<div class="tx">By the early 1980s, such proposals read like undecipherable hieroglyphics.</div>
<div class="tx">At Terra Nova, the participants acknowledged that any democratic reform against the IMF-led globalization agenda would face major political problems. If a government did not have the support of its population when it took on the G-7 and the abstract forces of economic domination, it would be ejected. For that reason, “the government should adopt forms of popular mobilization, organization and education which enable it to secure the active cooperation of the supporting social alliance, and the moral authority to ask for sacrifices. Experience shows that people make sacrifices willingly when they know that this is for a better future, and tolerate errors in management which are a natural part of the learning process.”<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1_b.html#en705" id="Ref-en705"><sup>68</sup></a> These sacrifices would be far from the austerity of the post–Third World epoch.</div>
