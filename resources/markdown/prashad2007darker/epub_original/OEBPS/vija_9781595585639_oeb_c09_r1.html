<b>ALGIERS</b>
<div class="tx1">In July 1962, the Algerians evicted the French. The FLN came to power, and one of its founders, Ahmed Ben Bella, became the nation’s president.</div>
<div class="tx">Ben Bella’s road to power was not easy. Born on a modest farm in a small town on the Moroccan border, Ben Bella had an uneventful childhood. He joined the French army, fought valiantly in World War II (for which he was commended personally by General Charles de Gaulle), and returned to Algeria. On May 8, 1945, Armistice Day in Europe, the French forces massacred several thousand people who had gathered for a peaceful demonstration in the town of Sétif. This massacre drove Ben Bella into politics. After an attempt in the narrow electoral sphere, he took the armed road. Enthused by the nationalism of Messali Hadj (who had been at the 1927 Brussels meetings), Ben Bella joined Hadj’s Mouvement pour le Triomphe des Libertés Démocratiques (MTLD). But impatient with its moderate tone, Ben Bella created the Organisation Spéciale, the armed wing of the MTLD. A few hasty actions led to Ben Bella’s imprisonment. When he was released, he joined eight other hardened revolutionaries (at the average age of thirty-two) to create the FLN. None of the nine main leaders came from either wealth or extreme poverty, being mainly sons of artisans or from the middle class. Some were Arabs, others Kabyle (Berber). In 1954, as they met to discuss strategy, they heard that the French army had been defeated in Dien Bien Phu (Indo-China). This encouraged them, and on November 1, 1954, they called out their underground army to revolt. This was the opening salvo in the Algerian War of Independence.</div>

<div class="tx">Armed action has the tendency to reduce ambiguity. There is no space for complex positions, because a war of liberation can have only two sides on a battlefield. Three months after the initial assault, colonial officials across Algeria noted a change in the popular mood and the emergence of a newly confident conversation about independence.<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en344" id="Ref-en344"><sup>1</sup></a></div>
<div class="tx">The FLN’s gambit succeeded politically, even if the military cost was enormous. During the course of the war, from 1954 to 1962, between three hundred thousand and a million people lost their lives. It was a heavy price to pay. All the factions within Algeria, even the liberals, lined up behind the FLN. They wanted freedom from French autocracy, and they were willing to subordinate themselves to the FLN and its military wing in order to get the French out. The factionalism within the Algerian liberation struggle was momentarily suspended. The FLN was a front, not a party, and it invited all Algerians to join. The Communist Party <?dp n="142" folio="121" ?> joined in 1955, as did the moderate liberals led by Ferhat Abbas. Abbas, who tried to ameliorate the FLN’s armed line, told an interviewer, “My role, today, is to stand aside for the chiefs of the armed resistance. The methods that I have upheld for the last fifteen years—cooperation, discussion, persuasion—have shown themselves to be ineffective; this I recognize.” <a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en345" id="Ref-en345"><sup>2</sup></a> The FLN would brook no neutrality.<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en346" id="Ref-en346"><sup>3</sup></a></div>
<div class="tx">The French responded brutally, and created the conditions for all forces to join the FLN. When the war entered the city of Algiers in October 1956, the trade union federation galvanized support for the militants of the Casbah, as did the previously vacillating Communist Party of Algeria. Included among these forces was a young doctor named Frantz Fanon. Born on the Caribbean island of Martinique, Fanon trained as a psychiatrist in France and went to work in an Algerian hospital. Already political, he now threw in his sympathies with the FLN. Before he left for Algeria, he published <i>Black Skin, White Masks</i> (1952), a searing diagnosis of racism’s effect on the person of color. The book earned Fanon a place in the planetary discussion of racism and anticolonialism—for instance, at the 1956 <i>Présence Africaine</i> conference on black culture held in Paris. Fanon kept in touch with these currents while he worked as the head of psychiatry at Blida-Joinville Hospital in Algeria starting in 1953. Faced with the bodies of the victims of French colonialism, notably those who had been tortured, Fanon resigned from the hospital in 1956. “If psychiatry is the medical technique that aims to enable man no longer to be a stranger to his environment,” Fanon wrote, “I owe it to myself to affirm that the Arab, permanently an alien in his own country, lives in a state of absolute depersonalization. The events in Algeria are the logical consequence of an abortive attempt to decere-bralize a people.”<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en347" id="Ref-en347"><sup>4</sup></a> Fanon documented the atrocities for the French media and the FLN’s own <i>El Moudjahid</i>. Fanon’s most influential book, <i>The Wretched of the Earth</i> (1961), came out just as he died. He was thirty-six.</div>
<div class="tx"><i>The Wretched of the Earth</i> is a collection of essays written by Fanon over the course of ten months (one of them was an address to the 1959 Second Congress of Black Artists and Writers in Rome). Already diagnosed with a fatal illness, Fanon dictated the book to his wife in haste; it was plagued with generalities and ill formulations, a lack of research as well as conceptual clarity. Nevertheless, it is filled with insights and fiery analysis. Sartre’s preface sharpened the edges of an already-sharp set of arguments, and Sartre’s comment that in Fanon’s book “the Third World finds <i>itself</i> and speaks to <i>itself</i> through his voice,” gave the document a magnified importance.<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en348" id="Ref-en348"><sup>5</sup></a> Fanon defended the right of national liberation <?dp n="143" folio="122" ?> movements to adopt armed struggle, as the movements would do at Havana’s 1966 Tricontinental. His defense, however, was not on tactical or even strategic grounds; he maintained that violence is necessary to wrench a colonized society into freedom and reshape the subservience of the colonized so that they might truly be freed by the act of <i>taking</i> their freedom. This section, the first two chapters, has come to define Fanon’s book. While it is no doubt of immense significance, it should not overshadow Fanon’s chapter on the limitations of the national liberation project once it takes state power.</div>
<div class="tx">That chapter, “The Pitfalls of National Consciousness,” was written before the FLN’s victory. It was a cautionary note to Fanon’s comrades. The disciplinary imperatives of an armed struggle, and the need to create a simple ideological and military battlefield, might leak into state construction and distort the egalitarian dynamic of national liberation. The Algerian people recognized that nothing could go forward without an energetic citizenry, and indeed in the areas under FLN control this self-management and collective planning had begun to manifest themselves. “In every <i>wilaya</i> [FLN district],” Fanon had written earlier, “cadastral plans are drawn up, school building plans studied, economic reconversions pursued.”<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en349" id="Ref-en349"><sup>6</sup></a> Freedom would come in the combination of the spontaneous energy of the people and the disciplined channels of the government. A woman who fought hard in the struggle noted that the FLN already had a superior organization, and that the “enormous apparatus that our leaders have rapidly set up rests on solid and proven foundations such as the confidence, devotion, participation and even heroism of our civilian population.” She looked forward to the opportunity for Algerian women as well as men to “take part in the rebuilding of our country.”<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en350" id="Ref-en350"><sup>7</sup></a> But the FLN failed the legions of anticolonial supporters who wanted a role in the creation of a new Algeria. The FLN’s charter did not fully support the energy of the people; it was keener to demobilize this enthusiasm. The Third World “nation” did not fully live up to its promise of radical democracy, where every person would be constituted by the state as a citizen, and where each citizen in turn would act through the state to construct a national society, economy, and culture. From India to Egypt, from Ghana to Indonesia—the great legions of the Third World drew their immense strength from popular mobilization, but none of these states enabled the people who created the platform for freedom to have an equal part in the project to build it. Of course, the construction of the new nation would require the labor of the people, but this work came with direction from above, and not with <?dp n="144" folio="123" ?> the co-equal participation of the people in the creation of the national plan or the division of the national surplus. The people had to act, not to lead but to take orders, and the state, the father figure, would protect its feminized subjects.<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en351" id="Ref-en351"><sup>8</sup></a></div>
<div class="tx">The great flaws in the national liberation project came from the assumption that political power could be centralized in the state, that the national liberation party should dominate the state, and that the people could be <i>demobilized</i> after their contribution to the liberation struggle. National liberation movements like the FLN divided the movement into two categories: the people and the party, and it was the latter that would conduct the work for the former. There was little class analysis, and little acknowledgment that there would be classes antagonistic to the project of the Third World. The party of the working people, not simply the people, would need to create democratic structures not only to socialize production (which they attempted) but also to socialize decision making. Without the latter, the state would be vulnerable to the counterrevolution of the old social classes of property and the disgruntlement of those in whose name it ruled. Fanon identified this problem before the FLN came to power, and his insights help us navigate through one of the principle failures of the Third World project: the lack of effective socialized democracy.<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en352" id="Ref-en352"><sup>9</sup></a></div>
<div class="tx">A hint of the problem came within months of the FLN capture of power. From July to September 1962, the FLN members fought among themselves. The people cried, <i>Baraket</i>, that’s enough, but it was only when Colonel Houari Boumédienne entered Algiers and handed the reins of power to Ben Bella that the guns went quiet. Ben Bella centralized power. The 1963 Constitution of Algeria abolished all political parties except the FLN, and elevated the president of the FLN to the sole formulator of state policy. The energy of the Algerian Revolution would now be concentrated in the body of the president, who for the moment was Ben Bella. The 1964 Charter of Algiers defended the abolishment of parties other than the FLN. “The multiparty system allows all particular interests to organize into different pressure groups. It frustrates the general interest, that is, the workers’ interest,” and therefore, in the workers’ name, there should only be one party, the “vanguard party.”<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en353" id="Ref-en353"><sup>10</sup></a> In November 1962, the regime cracked down on the Communist Party of Algeria, which was otherwise in line with the socialist agenda of the FLN, and it soon went after the Parti de la Revolution Socialiste, headed by the former FLN leader Mohammed Boudiaf; the leadership of both parties languished in jail. The FLN whittled its own <?dp n="145" folio="124" ?> ranks to a hundred thousand “militants” who would “be the best whatever they happen to be,” said Ben Bella. “By ‘best’ I mean he who is the most dynamic, who has the greatest loyalty, who sets an example, who somehow has no other interest than the party.”<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en354" id="Ref-en354"><sup>11</sup></a> When Ferhat Abbas was expelled from the FLN in 1963 after he objected to the lack of discussion over the framing of the constitution, he told the parliament, “For me the Party [FLN] does not exist! The Party does not exist, and there are no other FLN militants than those in this Assembly, in the administration, in the army. The day when a party is democratically constituted, I will applaud with both hands.”<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en355" id="Ref-en355"><sup>12</sup></a></div>
<div class="tx">Since the constitution had already endowed the president with unaccountable powers, the power of the party essentially rested with its head, the president. The “loyalty” of the militants would then vest not simply with the party but with the president. There was no separation of powers, no oversight of the president from either the judiciary or the parliament, and little need to answer to anyone for appointments to the bureaucracy.<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en356" id="Ref-en356"><sup>13</sup></a> The president could rule by fiat, a structure that welcomed a coup d’état because this alone could change the reins of government in a society that had been substantially depoliticized. The question was not personal, because most scholars and FLN veterans agree that Ben Bella’s character was not particularly given to the “cult of personality,” nor was he ideologically predisposed to it.<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en357" id="Ref-en357"><sup>14</sup></a> When Ben Bella had Boudiaf arrested, one of his close FLN comrades, Hocine Ait Ahmed, led a protest in the National Assembly. While he agreed with the goals of the revolution, Ait Ahmed said, he felt that Ben Bella’s state had reduced the nation to the “politics of <i>zaims</i> [clans],” or to the level of the old social classes. Little in the institutional framework of society had been altered, so Ait Ahmed went back to the Kabyle hills to lead an insurrection against the state. It should be said, however, that Ait Ahmed was himself unclear as to the relationship between the state and the party, and the state and the people. He sometimes called for a “revolutionary avant-garde party” and sometimes for a “multi-party system.” <a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en358" id="Ref-en358"><sup>15</sup></a> The problem had been identified (political centralization), but people like Ait Ahmed knew full well the power of imperialism to insinuate itself into a weak civil society. This contradiction, rather than any diabolical intent, was often what led many Third World states into the reproduction of authoritarian state structures.</div>
<div class="tx">Ben Bella and the FLN centralized political power in order to socialize production. That was the choice made by this regime and many other Third World states that leaned toward socialism. The FLN had to <?dp n="146" folio="125" ?> act rapidly, because the society it had inherited from the French had been devastated.<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en359" id="Ref-en359"><sup>16</sup></a> The seven-and-a-half-year war and the long period of colonial rule (1830–1962) had drained Algerian society. The FLN inherited the desiccated earth, still rich in nutrients and ability, but on the surface in ruins. Algeria’s wealth had been siphoned off by the First World, and little remained. Few factories, few schools, and few hospitals—the emblems of modernity had been built around the colonial maintenance of “tradition.” In this realm of necessity, the Third World had to craft its hopes. Of the twelve million Algerians, four and a half million lived in poverty, and two million had been locked in concentration camps, from which they went to abandoned herds and overgrown lands. As the French departed, so did the main bureaucratic staff, which meant that the state momentarily collapsed. The FLN had to rapidly take charge of the situation, create institutions that functioned, and help settle the massive dislocation that resulted from both colonialism and the anticolonial struggle. The task was not easy.</div>
<div class="tx">In March 1963, Ben Bella’s government promulgated a set of laws known as the March Decrees. These had been created in consultation with a group of European and Arab Trotskyites (including the Egyptian Luftallah Solliman, the Moroccan Mohammed Tahiri, and the Algerian Mohammed Harbi) who favored worker self-management. The decrees declared any vacant property to be legitimate collective property, legalized worker self-management on farms and in factories, and forbade speculation. The workers had already seized the vacant factories, and the peasantry had already grabbed three million hectares of prime land left by the French colon farmers. The new government institutionalized the inventiveness of the workers and the farmers. So far so good, but then the state made some errors. Whereas it had written no role for the state in these new institutions, it also tried to cut out the main trade union federation, the two-hundred-thousand-strong Union Générale des Travailleurs Algériens (UGTA) that had led the factory takeover. Ben Bella wanted the UGTA to be “autonomous within the party,” rather than an autonomous union, particularly because the FLN and the state were not yet strong enough to take on the UGTA politically.<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en360" id="Ref-en360"><sup>17</sup></a> The architects of the self-management schemes had good ideas, but they were not the ones to execute and oversee the self-management (<i>autogestion</i> ) project. Ben Bella nominated his old comrade from the MTLD days, Ali Mahsas, to be the minister of agrarian reform. Mahsas was not an advocate of autogestion; he wanted the schemes to be under state control. In April 1963, Ben Bella’s government announced another set <?dp n="147" folio="126" ?> of decrees that forced the farms to take credit from a state agency and market their products through that same agency. By January 1964, the factories had been placed under the control of the Ministry of National Economy.<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en361" id="Ref-en361"><sup>18</sup></a> The 1964 Charter of the Algerian Revolution adopted the contradictions: it hailed the need to nationalize the means of production, and argued that anything less than worker self-management was “bureaucratic formalism.”<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en362" id="Ref-en362"><sup>19</sup></a></div>
<div class="tx">The intellectuals who planned the autogestion scheme had not entirely considered the lack of political education. The FLN produced a major social change during the war, but it did not capitalize on it in peacetime. The attempt by the political commissars to subordinate all the independent institutions (such as the trade unions and all the political parties) into the state, and use the state as the institutional arm of the party, suffocated any attempt for social transformation. The Algerian peasantry was mobilized into the war, and suspended its various clan and ethnic divides in the service of the revolution. When it was demobilized, the opportunity for on-the-job political education needed for the creation of a new society lapsed. The peasants, observed a sympathetic book on the FLN, “have not proven as revolutionary as they were during the war of independence. They have not agitated to obtain an agrarian reform or to force the government to give more attention to their problems.” Rather, the peasantry went back to their villages and into the social worlds from which they came. “The number of new mosques is just one indication that the peasants, after the interlude of the war, have returned to their old ways and values.... In the absence of any leadership from the party or the government, the peasants have fallen once again under the influence of the traditional authorities—<i>marabouts</i> [holy men], <i>imams</i> [Islamic prelates], and village chiefs and elders.”<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en363" id="Ref-en363"><sup>20</sup></a> This was a major consequence of the lack of socialized democracy.<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en364" id="Ref-en364"><sup>21</sup></a> Groups like <i>al-Qiyam</i> (values), led by Hashemi Tidjani, would work on this terrain to create the social basis for the Islamic explosion that occurred in the 1980s.<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en365" id="Ref-en365"><sup>22</sup></a></div>
<div class="tx">French rule did not create a sizable class of Algerians with developed technical expertise. Those who had joined the colonial state were not to be trusted by the FLN. And the FLN itself did not have sufficiently trained people to take over the management of complicated technical institutions. A lack of such personnel meant that the FLN relied on those among the petty bourgeoisie and bourgeoisie who did not flee to France in 1962. A census from April 1963 showed that French nationals and Algerians of the French colonial period held 43 percent of the planning <?dp n="148" folio="127" ?> and decision-making posts, whereas they held 77 percent of managerial posts.<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en366" id="Ref-en366"><sup>23</sup></a> In 1959, the state hired 63,000 civil servants, whereas by 1964 the state had 100,000 on its books.<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en367" id="Ref-en367"><sup>24</sup></a> The treasury leaked into the civil servant salaries: 2.9 billion dinars went to pay their salaries, while only 2.4 billion dinars went to economic development .<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en368" id="Ref-en368"><sup>25</sup></a> The state apparatus bloated, as did that of the military, and these became the primary source of demand in the Algerian economy (as the state nationalized more and more sections of the economy, this role intensified). The central role of the state and the insinuation of the bourgeoisie into its ranks led to the creation of a parasitic relation between the state and the bourgeoisie. The intimacy between the state and this dominant class (and in Algeria, certainly clans more than others) allowed the Central Bank and the Customs Office immense latitude. Their independence shows that whereas the national liberation state was able to clamp down on democracy for the working class and the peasantry, and speak in its name, it allowed the bourgeoisie and its institutions to have relative autonomy.</div>
<div class="tx">The national bourgeoisie did not capture the national liberation party, the FLN in this case, or even the new state. In the anticolonialist struggle, the party adopted the patina of being above class and standing for all the people. Because of this role, it attracted the working class and the peasantry as well as the class that worked in a bureaucratic capacity for the state, in addition to some elements of the mercantile and industrial class. Apart from some exceptions (such as India), the merchants and petty industrialists were not autonomous from the state; indeed they relied on it—either for government contracts, through licenses to operate their concerns, or else by the space created for them through the national state’s tariff regime. National liberation parties that came to power without a well-honed class analysis opened themselves up to pressure from the newly confident mercantile and industrial classes, whose own position was greatly enhanced by the national liberation agenda for the domestic creation of industry, for the creation of a national economy. Although the national liberation party remained largely beholden to the bureaucratic-managerial-intellectual (sometimes military) elite, it did build close ties to the industrial class.<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en369" id="Ref-en369"><sup>26</sup></a> Import-substitution-type projects opened some space for institutional reform and social development projects, but in most cases they simply protected domestic industrialists who had no long-term commitment to the Third World agenda.</div>
<div class="tx">Some of the national liberation states, such as Algeria, pledged to follow a fairly radical social agenda—for land reform, and self-management <?dp n="149" folio="128" ?> in factories. The list of the reforms, however, is less important than the <i>character of governance</i>: would the state devolve power to the people, would it mobilize them into the acts of the state, or else would it demobilize the national liberation movement and promise to create change bureaucratically? If the latter, then the state would dictate to the people, who had dreamed while in the struggle of being partners in the national construction. When the national liberation state adopted “development” in a bureaucratic manner, it tended to mimic the approach of international agencies like the World Bank rather than the aspirations and hopes of the people who had empowered the new state in the first place. There was little discussion about how to bring the views of the peasantry, of men and women, of the outcast peoples, to the center of the national debate on priorities, nor about how to address differentials in relations of power between men and women, urban and rural folk, literate and illiterate people. The national liberation project had a tendency toward a naturalistic analysis of political rights: that if colonial power is removed, if the state is controlled by the national liberation forces, if these forces produce a decent economic model, then the people will be free.<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en370" id="Ref-en370"><sup>27</sup></a> The 1964 Charter of the Algerian Revolution anticipated this problem, as it warned the nation about the one-party direction. A single-party system could “lead to a petit-bourgeois dictatorship, or to the formation of a bureaucratic class that uses the state apparatus as an instrument to satisfy its personal interests, or finally to a regime of personal dictatorship that reduces the party to a simple political police.” If during the period of armed struggle, the charter continued, it was acceptable to think of political unity, this “must be reconsidered in light of the objectives and perspectives of the socialist revolution. Such a union is now outdated.”<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en371" id="Ref-en371"><sup>28</sup></a> Of course it was not revisited.</div>
<div class="tx">Algeria followed a tradition already established and defended in large parts of postcolonial Africa, whether ruled by governments of the “Right” or the “Left”—in Guinea (1958), Congo (1960), Ivory Coast (1961), Tanzania (1963), Malawi (1963), and Kenya (1964). The defenders of the “one-party state” argued that rival parties “have generally little interest for the great majority of the people.” The idea of “national politics” is central to the national liberation view of the one-party state. To break the polity into factions would obviate the idea that the freedom struggle had united the people with one interest, to create a nation against imperialism. Classes and social divisions could not be allowed to disrupt the “fundamental unity of the nation.” To allow rival parties might enable “a handful of individuals” to “put our nation in jeopardy, <?dp n="150" folio="129" ?> and reduce to ashes the effort of the millions.”<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en372" id="Ref-en372"><sup>29</sup></a> To allow dissent might, in addition, open the door to influence by imperial forces, which will adopt proxies within the country to destabilize it. The one-party vision is one of fear of the people, fear that any devolution of power would lead to antinational activity or would cause fundamental dissension where there should be an assumed unity. Many national liberation politicians, having grown up with the belief that their party represented the entire population, denied the different and often mutually exclusive interests that rent the social fabric. Both the industrialists and the workers benefited from high tariffs to prevent the collapse of a domestic factory, but both did not benefit equally; the workers had to labor under a regime of exploitation that remained in place regardless of the tariff. When the national liberation movement sent its people home, it lost its immense power base. A state that acted bureaucratically on a population had a built-in tendency to rely on congealed, traditional sources of social power and control. Older forms of association returned to the fore, such as tribal and class loyalties. These power bases became indispensable for elections or the implementation of the state’s development agenda. The national liberation state that came into being as the instrument of popular power now turned to the very agents who had often not supported it to enact its policies.</div>
<div class="tx">The problem of bureaucratization and the single party was a major topic of debate in Vietnam just as the Algerians won their freedom. At the 1961 Second Congress of the Vietnam Workers’ Party, Ho Chi Minh warned his party and nation about the tendency toward bureaucratization and commandism, for the bureaucratic attitude “shows in fondness for red tape, divorce from the masses of the people and reluctance to learn the experiences of the masses,” while commandism did not allow the people to “work on their own initiative and own accord and to use compulsion to do unexplained tasks.”<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en373" id="Ref-en373"><sup>30</sup></a> In the darker nations, among Communists outside the pale, there is an extended literature based on the practical experience of what the Vietnamese called “collective mastery” ( <i>“lam chu tap the”</i>). Che’s lyrical essays on volunteerism and Communist morality come from and engendered the “work councils” (<i>consejos de trabajo</i>) that continue to be a feature of Cuban social life. Cabral’s speeches on the duty of the Communist address the problem. Within a year of Guinea-Bissau’s freedom from Portuguese rule, Cabral’s government invited the renowned Brazilian educator Paolo Freire to visit the country, study its educational system, and provide assistance on a popular pedagogy for the creation of a nonbureaucratic society.<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en374" id="Ref-en374"><sup>31</sup></a> This was in the context of a country battered <?dp n="151" folio="130" ?> and devastated by war, and yet in search of the principle for a popular state. The resilience of the population strengthened the demand that the party not resort to commandism and bureaucratism but that it gradually create the mechanism for popular governance.<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en375" id="Ref-en375"><sup>32</sup></a> To set the task was one thing, but to be able to overcome the problem of technical skill and class hierarchy was another.</div>
<div class="tx">Because the national liberation state fails the population, Fanon wrote in 1961, “the masses [begin] to sulk; they turn away from this nation in which they have been given no place and begin to lose interest in it.”<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en376" id="Ref-en376"><sup>33</sup></a> In Algeria, by contrast, some sections of the masses turned their ire against the regime. Ahmed Ait’s Front of Socialist Forces attempted to assassinate Ben Bella on May 31, 1964. In June 1964 the UGTA, the main trade union, began to assert itself. Union workers struck on behalf of nationalization and against their limited role in statecraft. Strikes across the industrial spectrum paralyzed the country. The maneuvers by the workers and the newly militant UGTA as well as the onset of despondency among the people led Ben Bella and his core in the FLN to attempt a course correction. Ben Bella reached out to the UGTA at its Second Congress in March 1965; later, he patched up his relations with the Algerian Communists. The UGTA was entirely revitalized, and it was poised to play a major, democratizing role in Algerian society. Alongside it stood the Union Nationale des Femmes Algériennes, whose March 8 International Women’s Day rally in 1965 drew ten thousand women, and the Jeunesse du Front du Libération Nationale, which had reached its peak of fifty thousand members after it began to organize in April 1964.<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en377" id="Ref-en377"><sup>34</sup></a> Ben Bella’s autocratic interregnum seemed to be on the wane, as the social democratization implicit in the national liberation experiment seemed to be on the horizon. And then the army moved.</div>
<div class="tx">Houari Boumédienne, whose command over the army had given the presidency to Ben Bella in the first place, now revoked his trust. On June 19, 1965, just as Ben Bella received the Lenin Prize, the officers of the Algerian military broke into his house and placed him under arrest. Boumédienne took charge of the state, and the military became the main pillar of the regime. Although Boumédienne argued that he had taken power in reaction to Ben Bella’s cult of personality, the reason that best explains this coup is the rapprochement between Ben Bella and the organized Left. The tendency toward socialized democracy went against the grain of the carefully wrought fabric of the Third World state. Boumédienne understood that Third World socialism, unlike Communism, could not afford to alienate the national bourgeoisie and the army. His liberation army that <?dp n="152" folio="131" ?> entered Algiers in 1962 was no longer in place in 1965. In the interim, it had absorbed the officer corps of the French Algerian army and had taken on the character of the national bourgeoisie. This new officer element had a strong influence in the events around the ejection of Ben Bella.<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en378" id="Ref-en378"><sup>35</sup></a></div>
<div class="tx">Boumédienne continued most of the broad economic policies of the Ben Bella era: the nationalization of industry (particularly the oil sector, now consolidated into SONATRACH). Autogestion was entirely absorbed into the state structure, and industry earned priority over agriculture. <a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en379" id="Ref-en379"><sup>36</sup></a> The military played a larger role in society, which meant that it also had a greater claim on the budget. This was all financed in the main by Algeria’s substantial oil and natural gas reserves. These helped maintain a healthy treasury while oil and gas prices remained high. The state dominated society and ruled in the name of socialism. The class that dominated this state, however, as had been warned in the 1964 Charter, was the parasitic bourgeoisie (and its ancillary sector in the military). Boumédienne had a vision of a “solicitous” state that tended to the needs of a respectful and quiescent population. The state must extend its authority throughout society, Boumédienne believed, just as “the vascular system carries and breathes life into [the human body’s] distant extremities.” The regime’s enemies were like “intruders who have penetrated the body of the revolution.” They were an “excrescence,” a “gangrene” that needed to be excised.<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en380" id="Ref-en380"><sup>37</sup></a> Boumédienne, therefore, cracked down on the Left, particularly the UGTA, which largely vanished, and the Communist Party.<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en381" id="Ref-en381"><sup>38</sup></a> In a sense, Boumédienne’s was closer to the type of approach followed by most Third World states than that of Ben Bella.</div>
<div class="tx">Boumédienne’s personality did not allow for aggrandizement, but he did adorn the state with the emblems of the freedom struggle. A cult of personality grew around the War of Independence and the FLN. The failed national liberation project, Fanon warned, asks “the people to fall back into the past, and to become drunk on the remembrance of the epoch which led up to independence.”<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en382" id="Ref-en382"><sup>39</sup></a> Nostalgia is one means to prevent the total alienation of the population from the state. Nationalism is reduced to “grandiose buildings in the capital,” marches and processions, immense statues to the leaders, and other such decorations to celebrate a struggle that is unfinished in the eyes of the population. If the European and North American states had a cenotaph in a strategic place to honor the unknown soldiers who died to protect the liberties of the republics, the anticolonial Third World states frequently honored the sacrifice of the untold millions in the struggle for liberation. Murals <?dp n="153" folio="132" ?> of the unnamed people, though, came in the context of large portraits and statues of the leaders of the national liberation parties. The leaders who stood in for the movements closely held the political capital from the liberation struggle. Failures by the leadership did not immediately lead to disillusion because, for all else, the popular association of these leaders with the audacity of national liberation allowed them a great deal of latitude. Nostalgia, then, had a political purpose, and it was not simply the wistful hope of a blind leadership or the naive hope of a betrayed population.</div>
<div class="tx">The character who promotes nostalgia, often the only one who can do so, is the hero of the national liberation struggle who has become the head of state. This leader “stands for moral power,” the power of the struggle, but in doing so in the context of the betrayal of that struggle, “the leader pacifies the people.”<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en383" id="Ref-en383"><sup>40</sup></a> Since this leader is now the fig leaf before the naked extractions conducted by the emergent wealthy, he becomes “the general president of that company of profiteers impatient for their return which constitutes the national bourgeoisie.”<a href="vija_9781595585639_oeb_nts_r1.html#en384" id="Ref-en384"><sup>41</sup></a> By the late 1960s, Algeria had moved from an attempt to create a socialist state to a state capitalist one, with a parasitic bourgeoisie confident beside the strong arms of the military.</div>
<div class="tx">If Ben Bella had confronted the army earlier, his regime might have lasted for less time. In the interim, the Algerian government did promote a considerable socialist agenda, some of which had to be followed by the military government of Boumédienne. Algeria continued to be a player in NAM, mainly because its own foreign policy kept it outside any arrangement with the United States and the USSR. In 1973, Algeria hosted the Fourth Non-Aligned Summit, the largest until then. At the summit, Boumédienne called for the construction of a New International Economic Order (NIEO). He argued that non-alignment must be given a new meaning, where economic liberation must be paramount and political questions should be secondary. Political rights within a nation can be subsumed as long as the rulers had an economic agenda that confronted capitalism. This view found few detractors, mainly because by the time of the summit in Algiers a number of Third World leaders arrived either in military fatigues or with military designations before their names. Without an insistence on popular mobilization, the state form adopted by the Third World could be best governed by the military. From the coup until the eventual demise of the oil-dependent growth, the military dominated the country (after Boumédienne’s death, another soldier, Chadli Bendjedid, held office until 1992).</div>
<?dp n="154" folio="133" ?><div class="tx">The demobilization of the population led almost inexorably within the Third World to military coups and military rule. Where the military did not overthrow the civilian government, the inability of states to break from colonial borders and other such dilemmas led to a strengthened military brass. More money to guns meant less to butter, and therefore to an impoverished agenda for the increase of the social wage, the improvement of agricultural and other social relations, and better prices for exported commodities. The main social agency that demanded this agenda within the constraints of the Third World regime remained the Communists, and it was the strengthened hand of the military that often exorcised the Left (helped out by the CIA and given a blind eye by the USSR). The broader story of these tragedies occupies us in this part, as we make our way from the military coup in La Paz, Bolivia, to the massacre of the Communists of the Indonesian archipelago, to the border war between India and China, and eventually to the reduction of the Third World’s political and economic agenda into OPEC and the <i>ujamaa</i> villages of Tanzania. Neocolonial imperialism persisted, and the countries of the Third World remained in thrall to economic and political logics that disinherited most of them. The people wanted the formal trappings of freedom rather than flag independence (the Tanzanians called it <i>uhuru wa bendera</i>). They had to settle for mild reforms and nostalgia. Or else be “disappeared.”</div>
