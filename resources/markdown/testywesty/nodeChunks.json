As also noted in Chapter 4, Manley, Nyerere and Kenneth Kaunda were committed to pursuing the NIEO agenda in any and all arenas, including the Commonwealth. In the SI, as interest in the NIEO waned, the Manley Committee sought to repackage ideas from the NIEO, combined with a wider range of initiatives[^24], as a way of rethinking North-South relations, involving the socialist East more, and offering ideas for Western social democracy to break the stranglehold of neoliberalism.",

                    "Brandt had a long-standing interest in seeking \u201cto forge a middle ground between the NIEO\u2019s principles and the economic interests of Western industrialized countries\u201d, considering elements of the NIEO project and CERDS, particularly those relating to nationalization of natural resources and economic activities without compensation, as \u201ctoo radical\u201d[^20]. The continuities between the SI report and the earlier work of the Brandt Commission, discussed in Chapter 4, is all too clear, not least in the iconography of the covers; the Brandt Commission\u2019s drawing of a world map with a dividing line between the North and the South is re-used in *Global Challenge* but with the two parts of the world now separated from each other, indicating the element of crisis. According to Fulla, the drive to produce *Global Challenge* can be traced to the 1982 Vienna Conference of the SI, where Kreisky called for \u201ca Marshall plan for the South\u201d and Brandt for an emergency programme to address the crisis in North-South relations. A few months later Michael Manley was appointed as head of the SICEP and the work of the Manley Committee began[^21]. For Getachew, Manley, along with Julius Nyerere, belonged to \u201ca second generation of anticolonial worldmakers\u201d[^22], who developed distinctive socialist projects akin to what Davis in relation to Manley describes as a \u201cconcentric circles\u201d approach to international relations based on collective self-reliance, domestically, regionally, in the Global South, and globally through the NIEO[^23]. As also noted in Chapter 4, Manley, Nyerere and Kenneth Kaunda were committed to pursuing the NIEO agenda in any and all arenas, including the Commonwealth. In the SI, as interest in the NIEO waned, the Manley Committee sought to repackage ideas from the NIEO, combined with a wider range of initiatives[^24], as a way of rethinking North-South relations, involving the socialist East more, and offering ideas for Western social democracy to break the stranglehold of neoliberalism."
