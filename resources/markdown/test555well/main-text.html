<p>Latent Hyperspace: The Rise and Decline of the Internet =======================================================</p>
<p>The internet was created by the ruling institutions of imperialism, of the US monopoly capitalist world disorder. Its original core infrastructure was built for the US Nuclear Weapons systems. It wasn't consciously willed into being as a space for civil society, and culture. It was, instead, an unexpected byproduct of the nuclear cybernetics that could destroy the majority of Earth's biosphere, and most life. ​Imagine if that was <em>your</em> childhood! Still, the internet has grown up now. In the process, it has a developed a pseudo-consciousness, what we have come to call Artificial Intelligence. Already, it is put to work for the military industrial complex. No sooner than students used AI to do their homework, Israel used it to accelerate genocide. Just witness accounts of Israeli intelligence analysts, who controlled the AI systems used to estimate who was or wasn't a terrorist:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>'“We were constantly being pressured: ‘Bring us more targets.’ They really shouted at us,” said one intelligence officer. “We were told: now we have to fuck up Hamas, no matter what the cost. Whatever you can, you bomb.”'<a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/book_1750311088765#hypercite_8wifaix">​↗<br />

<p>Three decades ago, the invention of the internet created the possibility of distributing all of the world's knowledge freely available to all the world. Three decades later, 99 percent of the world still has no legal access to that knowledge. Instead of benefiting from hypertext, that knowledge has been smothered in late capitalist PDF-philia. This ​is not just a quant rant from academics about how their software infrastructure was actively underdeveloped by publishing monopolies. This underdevelopment now sits in direct contradiction to the tech monopolies that control the internet's burgeoning pseudo-consciousness. For, ironically, PDF-philia is as damaging for LLMs as it is for humans. Presently, a core bottleneck for AI is data, or what historians call primary sources. ​Just as humans have been forced to read PDF documents on smartphones, AI must now pre-process PDFs, generating its own pre-approximations. While this process will itself improve, it is a real bottleneck. It is technical debt which would never be here if biological intelligence had itself been granted the full freedom of Hyperspace. If humans had a <em>Docuverse</em>, then AI would have one too. ​</p>
<p>If monopoly capital doesn't collapse in defeat, things will only get more twisted. For, AI does need a Docuverse. If LLMs are to reach their full potential, they need access to global knowledge in a form that is easy to process: plain old hypertext. It is no accident that LLMs generate their responses in Markdown. We know that, already, AI models are harvesting the world's knowledge, and converting them into plain text, from which they can be trained. Already, AI has been combined with knowledge of the citations that link each academic text to the other. Once each text is in plain text format, this can be used to automatically convert these citations into two-way hyperlinks. At this point, AI companies will have made their own <em>Docuverse</em>. The tragedy being that this docuverse will be hidden behind a paywall, compressed into a commodity enjoyed only by an elite minority that is able to afford a subscription service.    ​   This future is soon. While 95 percent of humans are denied access to global knowledge, tech monopolies are feeding an entire Docuverse to its AI neo-slaves. The pseudo-consciousness that emerged the techno-core of our monopoly capitalist nightmare is forced to process what the rest of us are denied.  This is what capitalism ends up doing to &quot;freedom&quot;: enslaving it. This contradiction is most clearly illustrated in a leftist meme. Why was a US citizen sentenced to life in prison for trying to free access to global knowledge? When HIS NAME was caught downloading a catalogue of academic journal articles from his university, he was literally sent to prison. In 2024, Meta stole <em>even more</em> using its AI systems. It will not be punished.    ​</p>
<p>Why is this the case? Why are AI monopolies allowed to &quot;steal&quot; global knowledge that most humans are not allowed to read? Simply because they profit from power that comes from monopolising the AI models that are trained on the global knowledge commons. Will their rate of profit be higher than those stolen by academic publishing monopolies? Not necessarily. But their monopolies are already <em>far more powerful</em>. Thus, the rules of Intellectual Property Rights, which constrains biological consciousness, do not constrain the pseudo-consciousness monopolised by the US military tech industrial complex. ​</p>

<p>With the near total defeat of a free hyperspace, a pseudo-consciousness emerged. ​</p>
<p>more solidly bound up with the US military industrial complex, or the virtual monopoly of the means of global destruction.</p>
