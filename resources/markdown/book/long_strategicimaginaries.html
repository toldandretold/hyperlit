<p>A Non-Aligned Common Front: Strategic Imaginaries of the New
International Economic Order</p>
<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
<p>Fifty years after the Sixth Special Session, the Progressive
International has declared a strategy of 'rebuilding the Non-Aligned
movement', and 'renovating the NIEO'. However, key questions remain
about the praxis of the original. The draft declarations of the
programme of action and declaration on the establishment of a NIEO were
brought to the UN by the leaders of 95 states, caucused as the G77.
There proposals and strategies, therefore, were inherently plural. This
begs the question of how such a 'common front' had even been possible.
This article offers a partial answer by exploring the strategic
imaginaries that underlined the project. It first establishes that the
Leninist ideas of Kwame Nkrumah and the liberal ideas of Raúl Prebisch
converged at the level of world order. Then, by drawing on the work of
Mohammed Bedjaoui, it shows that these contradictory tendencies were
successfully synthesised in practice.</p>
<p>What would a successful NIEO have looked like? Clearly, this can't be
known, because the core proposals of the NIEO were never tested in
practice. Still, as C.L.R. James showed in <em>The</em> <em>Black
Jacobins</em>, imaginary 'what if?' scenarios are foundational to all
strategic decision making. To decide how to act, people imagine <em>what
would happen if</em> each option was taken. To understand the strategic
decision making of the NIEO, then, is to consider the project's
strategic imaginaries. How did G77 elites imagine a successful NIEO? A
full answer to this question is beyond the scope of this article. Here,
I consider the strategies of the NIEO more broadly, by focusing on on
its intellectual foundations. <strong>The Declaration and Programme of
Action</strong> drew on two distinct, but intertwined, praxes: Kwame
Nkrumah's critique of neo-colonialism and Raúl Prebisch's work on the
declining terms of trade. These organic intellectuals agreed on the need
for liberal reforms to world order. However, they did so for entirely
different reasons. Whereas Nkrumah imagined NIEO-style reforms as useful
for global socialism, Prebisch sought a global capitalism that worked as
its neo-classical boosters already believed it did. This strategic
pluralism allowed the G77 to forge global agreement amongst
ideologically diverse state elites. In this sense, the NIEO was a truly
Non-Aligned 'common front'.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>Understanding the strategic imaginaries of the original campaign is
essential for understanding the project's decision making. This, in
turn, is essential for the Progressive International's current goal of
'renovating the NIEO'.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> Unfortunately, the G77's decision
making has been systematically ignored by those disciplines best placed
to study it. As John Hobson and Alina Sajed have shown, both Orthodox
and Critical theories of International Relations are founded on
Eurocentric conceptions of non-Western agency.<a href="#fn3"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>
This is evident in the work of two theorists who closely studied the
NIEO in the 1970s. Then, both John G. Ruggie and Robert W. Cox believed
that a New International Economic Order might be immanent.<a href="#fn4"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a>
However, as soon as they realised that the project had failed, they
assumed that it had always been powerless.<a href="#fn5"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> For
Cox, this dissmissal was based on an overt counterfactual-phobia. Like
the great E.H. Carr, Cox dismissed counterfactuals as the stuff of
idealism.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> The implication was that there was
no need to consider the strategic decision making of G77 elites. Their
initial failure was enough to conclude that the NIEO had never stood a
chance of succeeding, and this was enough to conclude that the NIEO was
irrelevant to any historical materialist theory of world order.</p>
<p>An exception to this counterfactual-phobia came from the political
economy of Samir Amin. In 1982, Amin wrote <em>After the NIEO</em>, a
radical critique of the praxis of the G77, which he had opposed
throughout the 1970s. Despite his opposition, Amin posed the key
historical questions of G77 decision making, or agency. He asked why the
project failed, and questioned whether it had been inevitable. Fifty
years after the Sixth Special Session, similar questions are being asked
by the Progressive International. Yanis Varoufakis, for example, called
on the International to ask itself: '<strong>why did we fail the last
time round?'</strong> To answer this, and to 'renovate the NIEO', the
International must reckon with Amin's critique, including his Leninist
counterfactual. That is the task of this article. After exploring Amin's
strategic imaginary of the NIEO, I compare it to those that guided the
project. These included the Leninism of Kwame Nkrumah and the liberalism
of Raúl Prebisch. Then, I consider the strategic imaginary of the
Algerian jurist, and active participant in the original NIEO campaign,
Mohammed Bedjaoui. His work is evidence, I argue, that the contradictory
visions of what a NIEO would achieve were successfully synthesised in
practice.</p>

<p><strong>Samir Amin's Leninist Rejection of the NIEO's
Praxis</strong></p>
<p>In 1981, US banks –– in league with the IMF –– exported the first
financial crisis of the then-nascent neoliberal world disorder onto the
worlds poorest people. While witnessing this latest example of
imperialist savagery, Samir Amin posed fundamental historical questions
of the praxis of the original NIEO campaign. He considered whether 'the
factors behind the clearly visible failure' were 'purely contingent'
aspects of the economic crisis, or 'traceable to the "tactical errors"
of the Third World'.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> His answer drew on a Leninist theory
of imperialism as monopoly capitalism. Whereas advocates described the
G77 as a group of 'proletarian nations', or a 'trade union of the poor',
Amin assessed G77 states according to their ruling classes.<a
href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> To him, the G77 was a group of
'peripheral capitalist states and their bourgeoisies' who were opposed
by 'the monopolies and the imperialist states'.<a href="#fn9"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a>
Despite this tension, the NIEO had not sought to overthrow the
fundamental economic basis of imperialism: monopoly capitalism. Instead,
Amin wrote that its 'programme permits an increase in the rate of profit
on a world scale and can only be read therefore, as a contribution to
global capitalist development.'<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> In the end, 'the
monopolies and the imperialist states' won, something Amin observed in
the so-called Third World Debt Crisis. This 'resurgence of finance
capital' saw the IMF collude with US banks to install a 'tutellage
regime reminiscent of the protectorates established in the 19th Century
in the East and Latin America'.</p>
<p>By framing the emergence of the NIEO as a breakdown in the
inter-imperial bargain of Bretton Woods, and its defeat as the result of
a resurgent global finance, Amin was relying on a consistent Leninist
theory of imperialism.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> For Lenin, imperialism was not
simply a form of domination, but a historical era, the final stage of
capitalism.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> This followed <em>an age of freely
competitive capitalism</em>, a period when liberal economic theory more
closely approximated international trade, and when industrialisation was
more easily replicated by competing national economies.<a href="#fn13"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a>
For Lenin, this stage 'reached its limit in the 1860s and 1870s'.
Following this, the concentration and scale of capitalist production
became so great that industrialisation could no longer be easily
replicated. The implication is that industrialisation in the periphery
is far more difficult than it had been under the age of freely
competitive capitalism. Peripheral industrialisation is an uphill
struggle against the imperial core, which actively seeks its
underdevelopment. This is why Amin presents the G77 as 'peripheral
capitalist states and their bourgeoisies' and the global North as 'the
monopolies and imperialist states'.</p>
<p>Seen in this light, Amin saw the NIEO as part of the ongoing process
of inter-imperial bargaining that is inherent to monopoly capitalism. It
was a strategy of strengthening 'the Third World against the centres of
the system through a common front'. For Amin, the failure of this
strategy exposed the impossibilities of resisting imperialism on a
pro-capitalist basis. To make this claim, Amin pointed to internal
divisions, and the problem of 'sub-imperialism', which had plagued the
G77.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a> As it turned out, the NIEO campaign
allowed the relatively stronger partners 'to occupy a short term
favourable position in the International Division of Labour even at the
expense of the others.'<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a> This cemented Amin's theory that
economic development within the global capitalist system was especially
impossible for 'the "less advanced" countries for whom even dependent
development is a mirage.'<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref16" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a> As such, the NIEO was
not just a failed strategy. For Amin, it was a dangerous distraction.<a
href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a> The G77 had resisted monopoly
capitalism, but only from a petit-bourgeois basis, and only with
petit-bourgeois demands. As such, it had been destined to fail. The task
of peripheral industrialisation could only succeed, Amin argued, by
promoting grass roots social forces, those same social forces that had
created the global wave of decolonisation.<a href="#fn18"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<p>In articulating this damning dismissal of the NIEO's praxis, Amin
relied on a Leninist counterfactual. He considered what it would mean if
the NIEO Project could succeed in 'transforming this dependency
relationship and compelling the adjustment of the world system':</p>
<blockquote>
<p>'If that should turn out to be the case one should be able to look
back on imperialism as merely a stage - an intermediate stage - in the
expansion of capitalism on a world scale and not as the highest stage of
capitalism; it would have proved, that is, as the stage that ushered in
the transition from a system characterised by the asymetrical
centre-periphery relationships that define it to a homogeneous global
system dominated by capitalist relations.'<a href="#fn19"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As I show below, this was precisely the vision of Raúl Prebisch: not
to overthrow global capitalism but to revive it. However, the NIEO had
not only drawn on the liberalism of Raúl Prebisch. It also drew on the
Leninist political economy of Kwame Nkrumah, who imagined an entirely
different future for NIEO-style reforms.</p>
<p><strong>The Strategic Imaginary of Kwame Nkrumah</strong></p>
<p>Nkrumah agreed with Amin that imperialism was the final stage of
capitalism. His classic work on neo-colonialism hadn't revised Lenin's
theory, but applied it to the post-WWII world disorder. Nkrumah made
this point explicitly, arguing that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span dir="rtl">‘</span>Colonialism has achieved a new guise. It has
become neo-colonialism, the last stage of imperialism; its final bid for
existence, as monopoly-capitalism or imperialism is the last stage of
capitalism.<span dir="rtl">’</span><a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref20" role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Like Amin, then, Nkrumah understood the task of economic development
in the periphery as a struggle against global finance.<a href="#fn21"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a>
Indeed, Nkrumah saw neo-colonialism as 'the empire of finance capital,
in fact if not in name, a vast sprawling network of intercontinental
activity on a highly diversified scale that controls the lives of
millions of people in the most widely separated parts of the world'.<a
href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a> Unlike Amin, Nkrumah took a
pragmatic approach to this empire, arguing that 'it is impossible for
any of us to avoid dealing with monopoly in some form or another.'<a
href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a> For Nkrumah the question was not
whether to deal with monopolies, but how. With international solidarity,
Non-Aligned state elites could 'maintain the integrity of our financial
institutions' and 'leave ourselves room to manoeuvre away' from
neo-colonialism.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>24</sup></a> So whereas Amin advocated for
state-led autarkic development, Nkrumah advocated for regional and
global collaboration to mitigate the worst effects of imperialism. Here,
his focus was on pan-African socialism, but he also supported 'a
strengthening of the Afro-Asian Solidarity Organisation and the spirit
of Bandung', as well as solidarity 'on an increasingly formal basis'
with 'our Latin American brothers.'<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref25" role="doc-noteref"><sup>25</sup></a> Thus, whereas Amin
criticised the NIEO's 'common front' strategy, Nkrumah helped create it.
He argued that newly-independent states must act 'in a combination that
will give strength to our bargaining power and eliminate so many of the
duplications that give greater force and greater advantage to the
imperialists and their strategy of neo-colonialism.'<a href="#fn26"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
<p>In calling for international solidarity, Nkrumah imagined global
reforms that would become key pillars of the campaign for a New
International Economic Order. These included calls for aid to be
distributed by multilateral organisations operating democratically, a
'continental code to govern foreign investment', and support for
increased free trade.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>27</sup></a> Nkrumah didn't believe these
reforms would succeed in isolation, but thought they would be useful. By
mitigating the worst effects of imperialism, these proposals would boost
economic development in the periphery, and heighten the contradiction
between capital and labour in the imperial core.<a href="#fn28"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28" role="doc-noteref"><sup>28</sup></a>
Thus, despite what Amin might consider Nkrumah's "imperialist
reformism", this was pure Lenin. For Lenin had argued that monopolistic
superprofits allowed imperialists to 'bribe the labour leaders and the
upper stratum of the labour aristocracy.'<a href="#fn29"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29" role="doc-noteref"><sup>29</sup></a>
Nkrumah built on this directly, reasoning that any mitigation of such
superprofits would heighten class conflict in the core:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>'When Africa becomes economically free and politically united, the
monopolists will come face to face with their own working class in their
own countries, and a new struggle will arise within which the
liquidation and collapse of imperialism will be complete.'<a
href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>30</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a wildly different Leninism to Samir Amin. For Amin,
NIEO-style reform was a dangerous distraction. In Nkrumah's imaginary,
NIEO-style reforms were strategically useful. They would assist with
economic development in the periphery while heightening class
contradictions in the imperial core.</p>
<p><strong>Raúl Prebisch's Liberal Anti-Imperialism</strong></p>
<p>As the founding Secretary General of the United Nations Conference on
Trade and Development, Raúl Prebisch coined the idea of a 'new
international order', and theorised the foundations of the NIEO's
political economy. At the level of world order, Prebisch's work
overlapped with Nrkumah's. Both agreed that global capitalism was not
functioning as it had in the 19th century, and both believed that these
structural constraints could be mitigated by liberal reforms. This
overlap allowed their ideas to be synthesised in the founding
declarations of the NIEO. However, beneath the surface of this 'common
front' were two distinct strategic imaginaries. Nkrumah wanted to
transcend capitalism. Prebisch wanted to fix it with a more rational
form of global economic management.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref31" role="doc-noteref"><sup>31</sup></a> As such, he believed
NIEO-style reforms would benefit development in the core just as much as
in the periphery.</p>
<p>Just like Lenin, Nkrumah and Amin, Prebisch appreciated that the
history of colonisation had changed the structure and function of global
capitalism. He published this historical sociology in a founding UNCTAD
document, <em>Towards a New Trade Policy For Development</em>. Her
argued that in the 19th century, the United Kingdom had 'applied no
protectionist tariffs'. In this 'propitious international setting',
industrialisation in the core could 'turn outwards', and reap 'the
benefits of specialisation and of an adequate scale of production.'<a
href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>32</sup></a> The opposite is true for
industrialisation following the Great Depression. Then, elites in the
United States and the United Kingdom erected protectionist barriers,
which forced industrialisation in the periphery to take place in a
closed and hostile world economy. For Prebisch, this forced these states
to rely on the necessary evil of import-substitution.<a href="#fn33"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33" role="doc-noteref"><sup>33</sup></a>
In Latin America a wave of industrialisation followed, but it pushed
into limits that hadn't existed in the 19th century. Whereas Europe and
Japan benefited from large, global export markets, Latin American
industrialisation 'proceeded piecemeal in a large number of watertight
compartments with little inter-communication, to the serious detriment
of productivity.'<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>34</sup></a></p>
<p>Prebisch appreciated that this context of restricted and declining
world trade was mitigated by the establishment of the Bretton Woods
institutions, especially the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
(GATT). Still, he criticised its assumption that 'the free play of
international economic forces by itself leads to the optimum expansion
of trade and the most efficient utilization of the world's productive
resources.'<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>35</sup></a> Whereas the 'free play concept is
admissible in relations between countries that are structurally
similar', Prebisch argued that it didn't apply between 'the industrially
advanced and the developing countries.'<a href="#fn36"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36" role="doc-noteref"><sup>36</sup></a>
For as Prebisch famously showed alongside Hans Singer, the commodity
exports from the periphery showed a long term tendency to decline
relative to industrial imports from the core.<a href="#fn37"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37" role="doc-noteref"><sup>37</sup></a>
This was a direct result of the history of colonisation, which had
conditioned the economies of the periphery to serve the interests of the
core. For Prebisch, this meant that despite the best intentions of the
GATT, its principles perpetuated economic dependency. By demanding that
an unequal world lower trade barriers equally, the Bretton Woods system
was hindering, rather than helping, economic development.<a href="#fn38"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>38</sup></a></p>
<p>This historical critique was used to devise practical measures to
boost global trade and development. The goal was to mitigate the
structural forces making peripheral industrialisation harder than it had
been in the 19th century. This would require a real transfer of wealth
from the core to the periphery; the establishment of commodity
agreements to regulate and increase the price of peripheral exports; and
a general system of preferences. Here, tariffs would be lowered on
exports from the periphery, as a means of encouraging exports,
particularly for processed, or more highly value-added goods.<a
href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>39</sup></a> However, Prebisch never believed
that these measures would be sufficient. He made this point with a
counterfactual, arguing that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>'If the peripheral countries manage to secure a larger share for
their primary exports in the consumption of the industrial countries,
this, together with the transfer of income from the latter countries to
the former to offset the effects of the deterioration in the terms of
trade, will help to narrow the trade gap but will not in itself be
enough to close it. These measures will be palliatives, and the relief
they afford, though considerable in some cases, will be of limited scope
owing to the size of the gap. Hence, the absolute necessity of building
up trade in industrial exports.'<a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref40" role="doc-noteref"><sup>40</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Just like Nkrumah, then, Prebisch saw NIEO-style reforms as
complimentary to the crucial task of industrialisation. Also like
Nkrumah, Prebisch believed that this would require regional cooperation.
In isolation, he reasoned, most peripheral states lacked the scale
needed for competitive export industries. As an alternative, Prebisch
advocated the collective promotion of infant industries on a regional,
and global, scale.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>41</sup></a> As Prebisch was well aware, it was
'not a matter of controversy among economists that national protection
of infant industries is justifiable wherever such industries have a
long-run prospect of reaching a high level of efficiency.'<a
href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>42</sup></a> This efficiency required access to
wider markets, both in the core and periphery. As such, Prebisch made
two core proposals:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>'(a) developing countries should give preference to imports from
other developing countries in their own markets; (b) developed countries
should give preference to imports from developing countries in their own
markets.'<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>43</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>For Prebisch's neo-classical critics, this vision was a protectionist
nightmare. Anticipating this, he stressed that they did 'not have to be
a permanent phenomenon.'<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref44" role="doc-noteref"><sup>44</sup></a> The entire purpose, in
fact, was to create a world capitalist system in which no such
interventions were needed. As peripheral exports grew, the 'disparity'
with the core 'can be levelled out gradually.'<a href="#fn45"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>45</sup></a></p>
<p>Here lay the biggest difference between Prebisch and Nkrumah. Despite
agreeing on the need for liberal reforms to world trade, they did so for
entirely different reasons. Nkrumah saw NIEO-style policies as useful
for creating global socialism. Prebisch saw them as paving the way for a
world capitalist system that worked as its neo-classical boosters
already believed it did. Thus, he wrote that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>'With an effort of the imagination it is possible to visualize a
situation of dynamic equilibrium in the distant future in which the
trend in question disappears as a result of the world-wide process of
industrialization.'</em><a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref46" role="doc-noteref"><sup>46</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here lay the NIEO's essentially capitalist vision, that which was
dismissed by Samir Amin. Prebisch appreciated that the history of
colonisation had distorted international trade, such that comparative
advantage didn't function properly between the core and periphery.
However, he didn't want to transcend but to fix this. In doing so,
Prebisch imagined NIEO-style reforms as benefitting the core just as
much as the periphery.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>47</sup></a> This couldn't have been more
different to Nrkumah's vision, which assumed that any reduction in
imperialist superprofits would heighten contradictions in the core.</p>
<p><strong>Bedjaoui: The Strategic Imaginaries in Practice</strong></p>
<p>Despite their clear differences, the strategic imaginaries of Nkrumah
and Prebisch were synthesised in the founding declarations of the New
International Economic Order. Echoing Nkrumah, the NIEO called for
multilateral disbursement of foreign aid, a code of conduct to regulate
global monopolies, and the overthrow of neo-colonialism. Echoing
Prebisch, the NIEO called for the regulation of commodity markets, trade
preferences, and real compensation for the declining terms of trade.
This 'common front', as Amin described it, was essential for the
solidarity of the G77. It allowed capitalist and socialist state elites
to find common ground. Nevertheless, this compromise masked fundamental
strategic differences. As Nkrumah imagined it, NIEO-style reforms would
damage the interests of imperialists. If true, then the G77's goal of
reaching a global consensus in the UN General Assembly was unrealistic.
It would be better for Non-Aligned state elites to act independently.
For Prebisch, NIEO-style reforms were imagined as a more rational form
of economic management. If true, a global consensus could be reached and
it would benefit all. In practice, both tendencies were fused in a
changing and contradictory synthesis. Each G77 leader, and each
diplomat, had to strike a balance between these two imaginaries. This
was an essential part of their decision making. An example of this
synthesis can be found in the pioneering work of the Algerian jurist,
and active participant in the NIEO, Mohammed Bedjaoui.</p>
<p>Bedjaoui embraced the NIEO's contradictory synthesis, and grappled
with its strategic tensions. Indeed, the stated gaol of <strong>his
book</strong> was 'to make a rapid diagnosis of the present economic
order and add a forecast of what it will be or might become, after
weighing up the contradictory demands of the various groups of
protagonists in the world and identifying the balance of power between
them as expressed by their antagonistic relations.'<a href="#fn48"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48" role="doc-noteref"><sup>48</sup></a>
For Bedjaoui, this meant understanding the contradictory possibilities
of international law itself. Like Nkrumah, he saw international law as a
creation, and perpetuator, of colonisation. However, he argued that it
could be changed by decolonisation.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref49" role="doc-noteref"><sup>49</sup></a> 'On this basis', he
believed it 'should be possible, firstly, to determine the impact of
these world-wide economic demands on the future of international law',
and 'to draw up a <span dir="rtl">‘</span>legal strategy<span
dir="rtl">’</span> for seeking ways and means by which international law
could in turn contribute to the establishment of this new international
economic order.<span dir="rtl">’</span><a href="#fn50"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50" role="doc-noteref"><sup>50</sup></a>
In doing so, Bedjaoui relied on an eclectic mix of the intellectuals
discussed in this article. He drew on Prebisch's theory of the declining
terms of trade, a Nkrumahist theory of neo-colonialism, and Amin's work
on dependency and underdevelopment.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref51" role="doc-noteref"><sup>51</sup></a></p>
<p>The result does not always seem consistent. At one time Bedjaoui
sides with Prebisch by concluding that a New International Economic
Order would be beneficial to both the core and periphery.<a href="#fn52"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52" role="doc-noteref"><sup>52</sup></a>
At another he sides with Nkrumah, arguing that a NIEO would necessarily
damage the interests of the core.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref53" role="doc-noteref"><sup>53</sup></a> These conflicting
conclusions reflect the long view of Bedjaoui's strategic imaginary,
which included three phases 'in the contradictory relationship which has
grown up between imperialism and the new order':</p>
<blockquote>
<p>'In the first phase, imperialism is still strong enough to wage war
against the still hesitant idea of establishing a new international
order. In the second phase, imperialism comes to terms with the new
order when it realizes either that disorder is too prejudicial to its
own interests or that it may <span dir="rtl">‘</span>co-opt<span
dir="rtl">’</span> the new order and exploit it to its own advantage. In
the third stage, imperialism loses out to the victorious new order, and
a new structural revolution triumphs over the old structures.'<a
href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>54</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>By the 'second stage', a co-opted NIEO would be in in the interests
of the core. By the 'third stage' the core and periphery would not
longer exist. Until then, Bedjaoui imagined the G77 as 'a trade union of
the poor' struggling against the contradictions of the first phase.</p>
<p>The immediate task, he argued, lay in enshrining the principle of
states' 'permanent rights over their natural resources'.<a href="#fn55"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55" role="doc-noteref"><sup>55</sup></a>
This was essential for tackling the core problem of neo-colonialism, the
fact that postcolonial states had gained political but not economic
sovereignty.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>56</sup></a> It also reflected the new balance
of forces in the 1970s. By quadrupling the price of oil, OPEC
implemented its right to permanent sovereignty of its natural resources
in practice. In doing so, OPEC elites acted in accordance with Nkrumah's
vision, whereby the solidarity of postcolonial states could challenge
global monopolies, and heighten contradictions within the imperial core.
Under Algerian leadership, the NAM leveraged OPEC's new source of power
–– its control of strategic pools of global finance –– to call for the
Sixth Special Session.<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>57</sup></a> There, the G77 sought to legitimise
OPEC's actions via the global consensus of the UN General Assembly. This
tactic of building global consensus reflected the Prebischian belief
that NIEO-style reforms would be beneficial to all. Thus, the NIEO's two
strategic imaginaries were synthesised in practice, just as they were in
theory.</p>
<p>This contradictory synthesis was appreciated in Bedjaoui's critical
support of the NIEO project. He viewed the project's legal strategy as a
success because it had –– for the first time –– created a foundational
contradiction within international law. The founding documents of the
Sixth Special Session, passed by a global majority, meant that the
'right' of international law no longer correspond to the 'might' of the
global minority.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>58</sup></a> Still, Bedjaoui was critical of how
the G77 came to side with the more Prebischian goal of building global
consensus. To show this, he compared the declarations of the Sixth
Special Session to the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States.
The founding documents of the NIEO declared the principle of permanent
sovereignty over natural resources without any qualification. Only
<strong>one year later</strong>, in an attempt at reaching consensus,
the G77 made key concessions. For Bedjaoui, this compromise was a
mistake. The imperialists continued to deny the G77 a consensus
position, but the G77 had now qualified the principle of permanent
sovereignty, conceding that states might have to pay compensation. In
reflecting on this decision making, Bedjaoui claimed that all faith in
global consensus building was over.<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref"

<li id="fn13"><p><span dir="rtl">‘</span>Thus, the principal stages in
the history of monopolies are the following: (1) 1860-70, the highest
stage, the apex of development of free competition; monopoly is in the
barely discernible, embryonic stage. (2) After the crisis of 1873, a
lengthy period of development of cartels; but they are still the
exception. They are not yet durable. They are still a transitory
phenomenon. (3) The boom at the end of the nineteenth century and the
crisis of 1900-03. Cartels become one of the foundations of the whole of
economic life. Capitalism has been transformed into imperialism.<span
dir="rtl">’</span></p>
<p>...</p>
<p><span dir="rtl">‘</span>Half a century ago, when Marx was writing
Capital, free competition appeared to the overwhelming majority of
economists to be a <span dir="rtl">“</span>natural law”. Official
science tried, by a conspiracy of silence, to kill the works of Marx,
who by a theoretical and historical analysis of capitalism had proved
that free competition gives rise to the concentration of production,
which, in turn, at a certain stage of development, leads to monopoly.
Today, monopoly has become a fact. Economists are writing mountains of
books in which they describe the diverse manifestations of monopoly, and
continue to declare in chorus that <span dir="rtl">“</span>Marxism is
refuted.” But facts are stubborn things, as the English proverb says,
and they have to be reckoned with, whether we like it or not. The facts
show that differences between capitalist countries, e.g., in the matter
of protection or free trade, only give rise to insignificant variations
in the form of monopolies or in the moment of their appearance; and that
the rise of monopolies, as the result of the concentration of
production, is a general and fundamental law of the present stage of
development of capitalism.<span dir="rtl">’</span></p>
<p>...</p>
<p>'<span dir="rtl">‘</span>Competition becomes transformed into
monopoly. The result is immense progress in the socialisation of
production. In particular, the process of technical invention and
improvement becomes socialised.</p>
<p>This is something quite different from the old free competition
between manufacturers, scattered and out of touch with one another, and
producing for an unknown market. Concentration has reached the point at
which it is possible to make an approximate estimate of all sources of
raw materials (for example, the iron ore deposits) of a country and
even, as we shall see, of several countries, or of the whole world. Not
only are such estimates made, but these sources are captured by gigantic
monopolist associations. An approximate estimate of the capacity of
markets is also made, and the associations <span
dir="rtl">“</span>divide” them up amongst themselves by agreement.
Skilled labour is monopolised, the best engineers are engaged; the means
of transport are captured—railways in America, shipping companies in
Europe and America. Capitalism in its imperialist stage leads directly
to the most comprehensive socialisation of production; it, so to speak,
drags the capitalists, against their will and consciousness, into some
sort of a new social order, a transitional one from complete free
competition to complete socialisation.</p>
<p>Production becomes social, but appropriation remains private. The
social means of production remain the private property of a few. The
general framework of formally recognised free competition remains, and
the yoke of a few monopolists on the rest of the population becomes a
hundred times heavier, more burdensome and intolerable.<span

themselves, but also the diverse forms of dependent countries which,
politically, are formally independent, but in fact, are enmeshed in the
net of financial and diplomatic dependence, typical of this epoch. We

mean that import substitution policy should be abandoned. On the

gap, it was assumed that the tempo of the substitution process will
remain the same as in the past. There is still a margin for import
substitution, although it has shrunk considerably in those peripheral
countries which have made more headway with industrialization. The
margin could be appreciably widened if substitution were to be carried
out, not within each individual country's domestic market, but within
groupings of countries so as to reap more easily the benefits of
competition, specialization and economies of scale.</p>
<p>This more rational form of substitution policy could be applied to
imports not only of goods but also of services, such as freight and
insurance, which form an important component of the potential gap.
Furthermore, in some cases the export of these services might be
increased if a collective approach were to be adopted through such
groupings. But the difficulties in the way are by no means
negligible.</p>
