# A Non-Aligned Common Front: Strategic Imaginaries of the New International Economic Order #



>**Abstract:**
>
>Fifty years after the Sixth Special Session, the Progressive
International (PI) has declared a strategy of "renovating the NIEO."
However, key questions remain about the decision making of the original.
The *Declaration* and *Programme of Action* were brought to the UN
General Assembly by the leaders of 95 states, caucused as the G77. Their
solidarity was necessarily pluralistic, drawing on both Marxist-Leninist
and Liberal visions of what Adom Getachew called "post-imperial
worldmaking". This raises the question of how their \"common front\" had
been possible, and what the PI might do differently. As a partial
explanation, I explore the strategic imaginaries that underlined and
opposed the original campaign. To do this, I focus on the
counterfactuals used in Raúl Prebisch and Kwame Nkrumah\'s theories of
global development. After showing their relation to the strategic
decision making of the original NIEO, I show how they are now being
re-synthesised within the PI.

On the fiftieth anniversary of the Sixth Special Session of the UN
General Assembly (1974), the Progressive International (PI) is seeking
to \"Renew the Non-Aligned Movement\" and \"Renovate the NIEO\" (Havana
Congress 2023). Launched in May 2020, the PI is a movement of movements
aiming to unite progressive forces globally, and its NIEO campaign is
based on a sober assessment of the original. In calling to seize \"the
opportunity of the present historical juncture\", its *Havana
Declaration On The NIEO* notes that \"the crisis of the existing world
system can either entrench inequalities or embolden the call to reclaim
Southern protagonism\" (Havana Congress 2023). This is a lesson from the
rise and decline of the solidarity of the original NIEO campaign.
Initially, when the Non-Aligned Movement leveraged the new power of the
Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to call for the
Sixth Special Session, \"Southern protagonism\" was emboldened. However,
this was eventually crushed during the so-called Third World Debt
Crisis. This presents the Progressive International with the problem of
understanding, as Yanis Varoufakis\' (2023) has asked: \"Why did we lose
last time round?\" In answering this question the PI finds little help
from the academic literature, which is still struggling to understand
the project\'s strategic decision making. This article provides a
partial contribution towards a historical materialist solution. By
relying on the method of C.L.R. James, I trace the counterfactuals ----
or imaginary \"what if?\" scenarios ---- that animated two of the
NIEO\'s dominant strategic imaginaries. I then show how these strategies
were synthesised, first in theory and then in practice. The point of
this analysis is not to claim any certainty about what could have or
should have been done. It claims only to help with clarifying the
different possible decision making options.

The Question of the NIEO's Strategic Decision Making
=====================================================

By the early 1980s, scholars began to realise that the core proposals of
the NIEO would not be implemented. Instead, G77 solidarity was crushed
in the so-called Third World Debt Crisis. In this climate, a strange
consensus emerged, even amongst those who had once believed in the
possibility of the NIEO, or had at least taken it seriously. From the
imperialist Henry Kissinger (1982), to the theorist of embedded
liberalism, John Ruggie (Bhagwati and Ruggie 1984); and the historical
materialist Robert W. Cox (1981), all agreed. The demise of the NIEO
proved that it had never stood a chance. This dismissive consensus
became the baseline assumption across the social sciences. The
pioneering Global Political Economist, Susan Strange, went so far as to
describe the NIEO\'s hopes as \"an illusion\" (Strange \[1988\] 2015,
263). In Gilbert Rist\'s critique of development, he argued that the
NIEO\'s ambivalent proposals do \"no more than reinforce the existing
order of things\" (1999, 49-150). There is nothing wrong with these
conclusions, per se. The problem is that they were made without
historical research into the decision making which had created and led
the campaign. To prove that the NIEO was powerless, one must understand
the available options. Had G77 elites considered choices which, if
taken, might have led to more success? In short, no one knew, and until
Vijay Prashad\'s pioneering histories of the \"Third World Project\"
(2007; 2014), no one bothered to find out. Instead, the original NIEO\'s
failure was deemed sufficient evidence to prove its powerlessness. As a
result, one of the most significant events in the history of world
order, and global development, was dismissed or ignored by those
disciplines best placed to study it.

This dismissive consensus rested on a rejection of the counterfactual
analysis that is essential for making and understanding decisions. For
the historical materialist Robert W. Cox, this rejection was explicit.
He described counterfactuals as \"the stuff of idealism rather than of
historical materialism\" (Cox 1991, 175). Without counterfactual
analysis, however, Cox was unable to consider the decision making, and
therefore power, of the NIEO project. This can be appreciated by
considering the method of another historical materialist, C.L.R. James,
whose groundbreaking research uncovered the previously neglected power
that had created and led the Haitian Revolution. In *The Black Jacobins*
(\[1938\] 1989), James explored the key decisions made by the leaders of
global social forces. To do so, he relied extensively on counterfactual
analyses. For example, he analysed not just Napoleon\'s decision to
invade Haiti, but his deeply-considered option not to (James \[1938\]
1989, 270-271, 373). In doing so, James considered not just what
happened, but what might have been. This meant imagining entirely
different futures for world order (136). For example, James reasoned
that with better leadership, \"the French attack would have been
crippled at the start\" (299-300). From this position of strength, James
imagined that Toussaint might even have succeeded in forming an alliance
with the French republic (285). In doing so, he showed how imaginary
\"what if?\" scenarios are foundational to decision making. To choose
between option a, b, or c, a person imagines what would happen if each
option were taken. To understand the agency that created and led the
original NIEO, therefore, it is necessary to search for the
counterfactual analyses that the project relied on, even if implicitly.

Of course, understanding the decision making that created and led the
NIEO is difficult, even when searching for the counterfactuals used in
key decision making moments (Venzke 2018). For as C.L.R. James (\[1938\]
1989, x) was well aware, decisions are not made in a vacuum. They are
embedded within historical forces which people did not choose. The NIEO
is astounding for the simple fact that it was created by political
leaders and diplomats from 95 diverse forms of state, who held
contradictory beliefs about the post-WWII world order, and the
possibilities for reforming or transcending it. This was shown
brilliantly in Adom Getachew\'s (2019) *Worldmaking After Empire,* which
offers a deep exploration of the NIEO\'s intellectual foundations. In
doing so, Getachew traced the project\'s ideological contradictions,
including the fact that it had been \"Marxist in its diagnosis of
economic dependence\" but liberal in terms of its prescriptions (2019,
145). For Getachew, this was only one of the project\'s many \"internal
limitations and inconsistencies\", which were only hidden because
\"external challenges ensured that the project never had the opportunity
for its internal contradictions to unfold\" (171). This argument is
similar to Cox\'s original claim that the NIEO lacked \"a sufficiently
clear view of an alternative world political economy\" (Cox 1982,
150-151), and to a retrospective claim by Henry Kissinger that its
\"philosophical framework seems to me to be extremely elusive\" (1982,
153). Others have gone even further, arguing that the group\'s internal
disagreements prevented it from ever having the capacity to effectively
negotiate its core demands (Weiss 1986, 6-7, 44-47; Narlikar 2003,
58-69.). In other words, there never were alternative options which G77
elites could have taken.

This theory that the original NIEO had been so marred by internal
disagreements, and so lacking in a coherent vision of an alternative,
raises the question of how the project had been possible in the first
place. How could so many different state elites, with deep ideological
and material conflicts, create a global solidarity that forced
imperialists ---- like Kissinger ---- to negotiate? For the astonishing
thing about the NIEO is not that it had so many ideological and material
contradictions. That is a necessary part of any global solidarity. What
is remarkable is that these contradictions were synthesised in praxis.
To show this, I draw on C.L.R. James\' counterfactual analysis of
decision making to trace the strategic imaginaries that inspired the
praxis of the original NIEO. Of course, it is beyond the scope of this
article to consider the unique strategic imaginary of each individual
G77 elite. Instead, I trace the counterfactual analyses used in two of
the NIEO\'s foundational theories of global development, Kwame
Nkrumah\'s *Neocolonialism: The Last Stage of Imperialism* (1965), and
Raúl Prebisch[']{dir="rtl"}s *Towards a New Trade Policy For
Development* (1964). Each text relied on a distinct counterfactual claim
about what NIEO-style reforms would achieve. Nkrumah saw them as useful
for the eventual goal of creating global socialism. Prebisch saw them as
temporary measures useful for creating a properly functioning global
capitalist system. Nevertheless, at the level of world order Nrkumah\'s
Leninism and Prebisch\'s liberalism overlapped (Nicholls 2019, 59-61).
Even if Nkrumah and Prebisch disagreed about what NIEO-style reforms to
world order would achieve, they both supported the reforms (Bockman
2015). Here lies the theoretical basis, I argue, for the non-aligned
common front that created and led the original NIEO campaign. This
contradictory synthesis allowed the G77 to win support from Leninists to
Liberals. Whether one sought global socialism, or properly-functioning
global free trade, there was a historical, and therefore counterfactual,
case to be made for NIEO-style reforms.

Clearly, the \"common front\" contained contradictory social forces
(Amin 1982, 445). By envisioning, and seeking, a properly-functioning
global capitalism, Prebisch believed NIEO-style reforms would be equally
beneficial to the core and periphery. This implied a strategy of seeking
a consensus with capitalist elites in the core. Nkrumah thought that
this idea, that \"the developed nations should effectively assist the
poorer parts of the world\", had \"little prospect\" of taking place
(Nkrumah 1965, xix). By mitigating monopoly capitalist superprofits, his
analysis implied that NIEO-style reforms would be damaging to the
interests of imperialists. Thus, instead of seeking global consensus,
non-aligned elites should forge collective independence. In practice,
both strategies were synthesised. First, OPEC elites acted in accordance
with Nkrumah[']{dir="rtl"}s strategic vision. Working collectively, they
seized control of the global oil monopoly, which heightened the global
crisis. Then, this new power was used to call for the Sixth Special
Session of the UN General Assembly. There, the G77 acted in accordance
with the Prebischian strategy of seeking global consensus. Thus,
collective independence that deepened global crisis was used to power
the possibility of a global consensus that benefited the North and South
alike.

For C.L.R. James, the point of counterfactual analysis was not simply to
understand the history of past decision making. It was to use this
history to inform strategic decision making in the present. For James,
this meant asking not just what *could have been* decided, but what
*should have been* (James \[1938\] 1989, 282). It is for this
historical-materialist purpose that Yanis Varoufakis (2023) has called
on the PI to ask itself: \"Why did we lose last time round?\" Curiously
similar questions were asked during the final collapse of the NIEO, by
the project\'s radical critic, Samir Amin (1982). Even while agreeing
with the emerging consensus that the NIEO campaign had been powerless,
Amin embraced counterfactual analysis. This allowed him to ask key
questions of the project\'s praxis, including whether it had failed
because of \"tactical errors\", or unpredictable economic contingencies
(Amin 1982, 436). For Amin, there was nothing that G77 elites could have
done to avoid the destruction brought in the wake of the NIEO. In fact,
he thought the G77\'s \"common front\" had been dangerous. As such, this
article starts with Amin.

Samir Amin\'s Leninist Rejection of the NIEO
============================================

Despite contributing to the scholarly consensus that the NIEO\'s failure
was inevitable, Samir Amin\'s historical materialism did not ignore
questions of the project\'s decision making. He asked whether \"the
factors behind the clearly visible failure\" were \"purely contingent\"
aspects of the economic crisis, or \"traceable to the \'tactical
errors\' of the Third World\" (Amin 1982, 436). Amin could consider
decision making because he was open to counterfactual analysis (Patomäki
2019). Indeed, his answer to these questions drew upon an imaginary
\"what if?\" scenario. He asked what it would mean if the G77 succeeded
in \"transforming this dependency relationship and compelling the
adjustment of the world system\":

> If that should turn out to be the case one should be able to look back
> on imperialism as merely a stage - an intermediate stage - in the
> expansion of capitalism on a world scale and not as the highest stage
> of capitalism; it would have proved, that is, as the stage that
> ushered in the transition from a system characterised by the
> asymmetrical centre-periphery relationships that define it to a
> homogeneous global system dominated by capitalist relations. (Amin
> 1982, 441-2)

To explain why he thought this was impossible, Amin constructed a
theoretically consistent, and historically supported, account of
imperialism, understood as a historical stage dominated by monopoly
capital. Within this Leninist imaginary, the G77\'s \"common front\" was
defined by its ruling classes (Amin 1982, 445). Thus, whereas some
advocates described the G77 as a group of \"proletarian nations\", or a
\"trade union of the poor\" (Getachew 2019, 168; Sauvant 2014, 9; Moyn
2019, 103-104), Amin defined them as a group of \"peripheral capitalist
states and their bourgeoisies\" (Amin 1982, 432). In their struggle to
industrialise, the peripheral bourgeoisies were opposed by \"the
monopolies and the imperialist states\". Despite this resistance to the
core, Amin noted that the NIEO \"permits an increase in the rate of
profit on a world scale and can only be read therefore, as a
contribution to global capitalist development.\" What\'s more, Amin
pointed to the problem of \"sub-imperialism\" within the G77, and argued
that the NIEO had the \"effect of turning the Third World into a fair
game for the rival superpowers\" (1982, 447-8).

Despite imagining the NIEO as both dangerous and ultimately powerless,
Amin did not, for this reason, ignore non-Western agency, as did other
historical materialists, like Cox (Hobson and Sajed 2017). To explain
the \"atmosphere\" which had made it \"possible to contemplate\" a NIEO,
Amin pointed to a global upsurge of popular forces across the global
South (1982, 439). Likewise, he predicted a \"new wave of popular
struggles\" (447-448). Citing the anti-colonial revolutions that had
made the entire post-WWII world order possible in the first place, Amin
looked towards the future. \"Not for the first time,\" he argued, \"the
peoples of the Third World may well lead the process of world
transformation\" (447-448). This critique has devastating implications
for the Progressive International (PI). If Amin is right, their is no
point in attempting to \"Renovate the NIEO\". Instead, the PI would be
better placed to focus on the development of domestic, and revolutionary
social forces. However, other counterfactuals, and therefore strategies,
are possible.

The Strategic Imaginary of Kwame Nkrumah
========================================

Nkrumah agreed with Amin that imperialism was the final stage of
capitalism. His classic work on neo-colonialism had not revised Lenin\'s
theory, but applied it to the post-WWII world order, a point which
Nkrumah made explicit:

> Colonialism has achieved a new guise. It has become neo-colonialism,
> the last stage of imperialism; its final bid for existence, as
> monopoly-capitalism or imperialism is the last stage of capitalism.
> (1965, 31)

Thus, like Amin, Nkrumah understood the task of economic development in
the periphery as a struggle against \"the empire of finance capital\"
(35-36). Unlike Amin, Nkrumah (1965, 32) adopted a working relationship
with this empire, arguing that \"it is impossible for any of us to avoid
dealing with monopoly in some form or another.\" He believed that with
international solidarity, non-aligned state elites could \"maintain the
integrity of our financial institutions\" and \"leave ourselves room to
manoeuvre away\" from neo-colonialism (Nkrumah 1965, 32). Here, his
focus was on pan-Africanism, but he also supported \"a strengthening of
the Afro-Asian Solidarity Organisation and the spirit of Bandung\", as
well as solidarity \"on an increasingly formal basis\" with \"our Latin
American brothers\" (Nkrumah 1965, 253-254). Thus, whereas Amin
criticised the NIEO\'s common-front strategy, Nkrumah helped create it.
He argued that newly-independent states must act \"in a combination that
will give strength to our bargaining power and eliminate so many of the
duplications that give greater force and greater advantage to the
imperialists and their strategy of neo-colonialism\" (Nkrumah 1965,
30-31).

In calling for international solidarity, Nkrumah ---- like other
socialists ---- had not opposed foreign direct investment or free trade
(Biney 2011, 108; Bockman 2015). Indeed, he had imagined global reforms
that would become key pillars of the campaign for a New International
Economic Order. Besides calling to overthrow neo-colonialism (UNGA
1974b, Chapter II, Section 1(a): i-xii), the founding declarations
called for:

aid to be distributed multilaterally (Nkrumah 1965, xv-xvi; UNGA 1974a,
para. 4 (k));

a \"continental code to govern foreign investment\" (Nkrumah 1965, 257;
UNGA 1974b, Section V); and

support for increased free trade (Nkrumah 1965, 9; UNGA 1974b, Section I
3. (ii)).

Nkrumah did not believe these reforms would succeed in isolation, but
thought they would be useful. By mitigating the worst effects of
imperialism, these proposals would boost economic development in the
periphery, and heighten the contradiction between capital and labour in
the imperial core (Nkrumah 1965, 255-256). Lenin (\[1917\] 2008) had
argued that monopolistic \"superprofits\" allowed imperialists to
\"bribe the labour leaders and the upper stratum of the labour
aristocracy.\" Nkrumah built on this directly, reasoning that any
mitigation of superprofits would heighten class conflict in the core:

> When Africa becomes economically free and politically united, the
> monopolists will come face to face with their own working class in
> their own countries, and a new struggle will arise within which the
> liquidation and collapse of imperialism will be complete. (1965,
> 255-256)

Of course, Nkrumah never imagined that this would be possible solely
with NIEO-style reforms. Nor did he imagine that they would be won
through diplomatic consensus (Getachew 2009, 149-150). Within his
imaginary, NIEO-style reforms would challenge monopoly capitalist super
profits and, therefore, the interests of imperialist elites. As such,
Nkrumah focused on building non-aligned coalitions, and regional
ordering, like his proposed \"All-African Union Government\" (Nkrumah
1965, 35-36; Getachew 2019, 102). This was justified by his
counterfactual analysis, or strategic imaginary. For if NIEO-style
reforms would assist economic development in the periphery while
heightening class contradictions in the imperial core, then there was
little chance of imperialist concessions. Instead, non-aligned elites
would have to create NIEO-style reforms and institutions themselves.
Importantly, this aspect of Nkrumah\'s *Neo-colonialism* isn\'t found in
the NIEO\'s founding declarations. These claim, with Prebisch, that the
NIEO would be just as beneficial to the core as to the periphery.
Nevertheless, Nkrumah\'s strategic imaginary supported, and reflected, a
strategic tradition which ---- via the Non-Aligned Movement ---- had
acted within both OPEC and the G77. By seizing their permanent
sovereignty over natural resources, OPEC quadrupled the price of its
oil. In doing so, OPEC seized control of the monopoly capitalist
super-profits which imperialist elites had been stealing for decades. As
I show bellow, it was this collective independence that had underlined
the NIEO\'s initial moment of possibility.

Raúl Prebisch\'s Strategy of a Liberal Consensus
================================================

Whereas Nkrumah imagined NIEO-style reforms as useful for creating
global socialism, Prebisch believed they would help create a global
capitalism that functioned as it was already supposed to. Thus, while
both were foundational influences on the NIEO, their support was based
on contradictory justifications. In the 1960s, Prebisch believed
NIEO-style reforms would benefit economic growth in the core just as
much as in the periphery. As his first report as the Secretary General
of UNCTAD made clear, he didn\'t seek to transcend capitalism but to
save it through reforms to the post-WWII Bretton Wood system. Take, for
example, his criticism of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
(GATT). He did not oppose its core goal of promoting free trade, but its
historical blindness to the fact that the benefits of free trade did not
apply between \"the industrially advanced and the developing countries\"
(Prebisch 1964, 29; Bockman 2015, 115). For, as Prebisch established
alongside Hans Singer, exports from the periphery showed a long-term
tendency to decline relative to their industrial imports (Toye 2003).
This implied that if the GATT\'s rules and norms were applied equally
between the core and periphery, they would hinder, rather than help,
economic development (Prebisch 1964). To amend this, Prebisch sought to
unify the newly-formed G77 behind a set of reforms aimed at supporting
peripheral industrialisation (Dosman 2008, 394-395). These measures
included a real transfer of wealth from the core to the periphery; the
establishment of commodity agreements to regulate and increase the price
of peripheral exports; and a general system of preferences. Like
Nkrumah, Prebisch never believed that these reforms would be sufficient.
He made this point with a counterfactual, imagining that:

> If the peripheral countries manage to secure a larger share for their
> primary exports in the consumption of the industrial countries, this,
> together with the transfer of income from the latter countries to the
> former to offset the effects of the deterioration in the terms of
> trade, will help to narrow the trade gap but will not in itself be
> enough to close it. (Prebisch 1964, 20)

What\'s more, none of Prebisch\'s proposed reforms were intended to be
permanent (1964, 31). Support for peripheral industrialisation would, in
keeping with the principles of the infant industry thesis, only be
temporary. As peripheral industrialisation grew, the \"disparity\" with
the core \"can be levelled out gradually\" (Prebisch 1964, 31). Indeed,
Prebisch wrote that: \"With an effort of the imagination it is possible
to visualise a situation of dynamic equilibrium in the distant future in
which \[the declining terms of trade\] disappears as a result of the
world-wide process of industrialization\" (Prebisch 1964, 15).

Here lies the biggest difference between Prebisch and Nkrumah. For
Prebisch, NIEO-style reforms would not significantly threaten the power
or profits of state elites from the global North. For these were not
radical nor permanent reforms, and would have the effect of increasing
economic development in both the core and periphery. This had important
strategic implications. If true, then with support of UNCTAD economists
like Prebisch, the G77 could create global reforms to world order
through \"joint responsibilities, common objectives, and convergent
measures\" (Prebisch 1984, 183). This strategic imaginary was a
fundamental part the NIEO\'s founding declarations, which claimed that
it would help both North and South alike. What\'s more, it is seen in
the legal strategy deployed by the G77, which sought to reform the
United Nations from within, on the basis of global consensus (Bedjaoui
1979, 196-197). It is this moderate tendency that scholars, including
Samir Amin, have used to describe the NIEO as an essentially \"Keynesian
liberal\" project (Murphy 2005, 12; see also: Helleiner 2016). However,
this was only one of the project\'s strategic imaginaries, which also
included, as Getachew (2019) made clear, more radical, Marxist
critiques.

Decision making: the strategic imaginaries in practice
======================================================

So far, this article has shown that Nkrumah and Prebisch contributed
conflicting visions of what NIEO-style reforms could achieve, and how
they could be created. While incredibly important, these strategic
imaginaries are just two manifestations of much broader, and global,
strategic traditions (Bockman 2015; Getachew 2019; Prashad 2014). The
more radical strategy of collective independence was promoted within the
NAM, which Nkrumah helped found (Sauvant 2014, 5). The more moderate
strategy of seeking a global consensus was promoted within UNCTAD and
the G77 (Prebisch 1984, 183). In this concluding section, I turn to
consider how the strategies promoted by Nkrumah and Prebisch related to
the rise and decline of the original NIEO. In key decision making
moments, how did G77 elites choose between the options made available by
these two strategic traditions? I argue that the NIEO was created by a
non-aligned common front that was originally empowered by a synthesis of
both strategies. Initially, Western elites tried to use the petrodollar
crisis as a pretext to end the IMF\'s \"radical\" attempt at creating
\"a quantum jump into a new system\" (IMF 1972, 4; De Vries 1985,
240-242). In response, Algerian president Houari Boumédiène leveraged
OPEC\'s new power to call for the Sixth Special Session, where decisions
would be made on all matters of global economic development (Sauvant
2014, 5). In this way, the strategy of collective independence, backed
by OPEC elites seizing \"full permanent sovereignty\" over their natural
resources, was used to empower the strategy of seeking a global
consensus for the benefit all (UNGA 1974).

This strategic synthesis, which empowered the NIEO\'s initial moment of
possibility, peaked at the Seventh Special Session, in September 1975.
At this time, the world economic crisis was marked by continued
uncertainty, and a decline in the value of the recently-floated
US-dollar. This was a problem for OPEC\'s surpluses, which were
themselves a core focus of the IMF. These problems made OPEC\'s (1975)
*Solemn Declaration* all the more believable. In it, OPEC\'s heads of
state explicitly tied their oil and financial power to the goal of a
NIEO. In the lead up to the Seventh Special Session, CIA analysis feared
what it called \"the radicals, led by Algeria\" (CIA 1975). Because the
radicals wanted \"a big transfer of resources\" and \"have a lot of
power\", the Intelligence Memorandum suggested that \"compromise may
need to be struck in regards to commodities\", and ---- indeed ----
Kissinger brought what appeared like a genuine willingness to compromise
(Gosovic and Ruggie 1976; Sargent 2015; Dietrich 2017, 284-289).
However, by the end of the Paris Conference on International Economic
Cooperation (CIEC), in 1977, the exchange rate of the US-dollar appeared
to have stabilised. For the more conservative OPEC elites, this made the
option of leading experimental investments in the NIEO\'s core
institutions relatively riskier than siding with the status-quo, US-led
order (Nicholls 2019, 146-149). Through massive increases in US arms
sales, Iran and Saudi Arabia chose to use their new pools of monopoly
capital to increase their ties to imperialism (Wright 2014; Brzoska and
Ohlson 1987, pp. 343-348). As a result, US negotiators dropped their
willingness to compromise. Indeed, at the CIEC, they dismissed all
concerns about the growing debt crisis, claiming that it would fix
itself (UNA 1976; Nicholls 2019, 150-151). With the conference ending in
failure, G77 solidarity declined.

The rise and decline of this original strategic synthesis raises two
counterfactual questions. First, as Samir Amin considered in 1982, is
the question of unpredictable economic contingencies. What if the
economic crisis had deepened, from 1975-1977, further eroding, rather
than apparently stabilising, the value of OPEC\'s surpluses? Would Saudi
elites have then been more likely to finance experiments in the NIEO,
like UNCTAD\'s proposed Common Fund? Even if the Common Fund failed to
underlie a new wave of commodity price agreements, it seems likely that
it would have materially legitimised the entire strategic imaginary of
South-South cooperation. Secondly, if G77 solidarity had been
strengthened, rather than weakened, could it have formed a debtors\'
cartel, as proposed by Cuba? The counterfactual of a debtors\' cartel is
tantalising because of how close the world economic crisis came, even
without a cartel, to collapsing the US financial system (Corbridge 1993,
44-45; Helleiner 1996, 176; Mazower 2013, 351). To avoid such a
collapse, US state and financial elites employed their own strategy of
collective independence, wielding the full weight of their monopoly
finance capital to maximise their imperial power and quash economic
development in South America and Africa for over a decade (Bazbauers and
Engel 2021; Easterly 2001; Harvey 2005, 29; Prashad 2014, 5-7; Stewart
2012, 88, 92). With a debtors\' cartel, things could have been
otherwise. By risking a systemic collapse of the still-bourgeoning
neoliberal world disorder, this new form of collective independence
could have forced the North-South dialogue back to the future of the
early 1970s, when most state elites, even in the North, supported some
form of reformed Bretton Woods (De Vries 1985, 242-243, 255-256). Thus,
again, the strategic synthesis between the NIEO\'s more radical,
non-aligned strategy, and its more moderate, consensus-seeking strategy,
would have helped decide the future of world order, and global
development.

Of course, such counterfactual scenarios are imaginary, and can\'t be
tested with historical research. Still, as C.L.R. James argued, the
point of analysing historical decision making is not just to understand
what actually could have been decided, but to understand also what
\"should\" have been (\[1938\]1989, 282). It is by asking these
questions that historical materialism can fulfil Cox\' purpose of
serving as a \"guide to strategic action for brining about an
alternative order\" (Cox 1981, 129-130). For it is through such
imaginary \"what if?\" scenarios that consciousness considers its
options. Indeed, it is not surprise that in the lead up to the
Progressive International\'s 2024 Havana Congress it asked: \"Should we
form a club of debtor nations to navigate the crisis of sovereign
debt?\" (PI 2024) This fits a more general tendency within the movement
towards the NIEO\'s Nkrumahist strategic tradition. By acknowledging
that the original NIEO \"was won through the exercise of collective
power in the coordinated production of petroleum\", the PI declares that
its own \"vision today can only be realized through the collective
action of the South\". To explore such strategic possibilities, Michael
Galant (2024) considered the history of the original NIEO, and concluded
that \"even a united negotiating front is only as strong as its
underlying balance of power\". For Galant, a member of the PI\'s
Executive Committee, the implication is that the movement must create
\"South-South collective action\" in the form of a \"new critical
minerals cartel\" and a \"club of debtor nations\". As these statements
make clear, the Progressive International\'s current attempts at
\"renovating the NIEO\" are being based on a reconsideration of the
exact strategies that were sorely missed during the demise of the
original. The PI is looking to the past, in order to consider what
could, and should, have been done differently.

The PI\'s emphasis on developing a more Nkrumahist strategy has not
rendered the NIEO\'s Prebischian vision unimportant. This can still be
strongly felt, particularly within the strategic imaginary of Yanis
Varoufakis, an economist and former Greek finance minister well placed
to appreciate the contradictory possibilities of sovereign debt. In
2023, he called on the PI to ask itself: \"why did we fail the last time
round?\" Curiously, his answer shares many similarities with the
strategic imaginaries discussed above, those of Amin, Nkrumah and
Prebisch. Echoing Amin\'s critique of \"sub-imperialism\" within the G77
itself, Varoufakis (2024) argued the the PI \"must not repeat the
mistake\" of relying on \"the elites of the Global South\". He made this
point with an imaginary, \"what if?\" scenario, arguing that: \"Our New
Non-Aligned Movement will fail if we give it a narrow role of bringing
together the G77 and the BRICS in opposition to the West.\" His vision
also evokes the NIEO\'s more moderate vision, even if Prebisch gets
sidelined. While calling instead for \"Green Keynesianism\", Varoufakis
remains skeptical of the ability of the capitalist class to support
this, \"the very road that leads to its own salvation.\" As such, he
calls ---- instead ---- to focus on socialising the means of production.
This evokes what Johanna Bockman (2015) called the NIEO\'s \"Socialist
Globalisation\", and shows that the contradictory synthesis that
informed the strategic decision making of the original NIEO is, today,
being re-synthesised anew.

Conclusion
==========

In seeking to \"renovate the NIEO\", the PI is opposed by a broad
academic consensus that the original project had never been possible.
The problem with this dismissive consensus is that is has been unable to
properly grapple with the strategic decision making that created and led
the original campaign. By borrowing from the method of C.L.R. James, I
have offered a partial contribution towards such an analysis, and shown
that it must be counterfactual. I showed this by tracing the
counterfactuals that formed the basis of the strategic imaginaries of
Amin, Nkrumah and Prebisch. In their different visions of global
development, these political economists made different claims about what
should be done. With these outlined, I showed how the Nkrumahist and
Prebischian strategic imaginaries were intertwined at the level of world
order. The strategies that they helped found formed the practical basis
of the non-aligned common front which created and led the NIEO campaign.
To understand the decline of the original NIEO, I argue, is to
understand how this strategic synthesis unravelled. This helps explain
the strategic decision making taking place right now, within the
Progressive International. With its appreciation of the contradictory
possibilities of global crisis, its own strategic decision making is
being led by a conscious effort to rebuild the direct, collective power
that had made the NIEO possible in the first place, and was missing
during the debt crisis.
