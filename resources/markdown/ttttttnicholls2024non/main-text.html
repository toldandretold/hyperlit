<h1>A Non-Aligned Common Front: Strategic Imaginaries of the New International Economic Order (NIEO)</h1>
<p>Fifty years after the Sixth Special Session, the Progressive International (PI) has declared a strategy of &quot;renovating the NIEO&quot;. However, key questions remain about the decisions that created and led the original campaign. The NIEO's draft declarations were brought to the UN General Assembly by the leaders of 95 states, caucused as the G77. Their solidarity was necessarily pluralistic, drawing on Marxist and Liberal visions of what Adom Getachew called “post-imperial worldmaking”. This raises the question of how this global &quot;common front&quot; was possible, and what the PI might do differently this time. As a partial explanation, I compare two of the project's strategic imaginaries, showing that they were successfully synthesised in practice. As this legacy inspires the PI's focus on the possibilities of sovereign debt crises, the NIEO continues to play an important historical role. It alludes to possible options, or alternative futures, of world order and global development.</p>

<p>This article is part of a Special Issue commemorating the fiftieth anniversary of the campaign for a NIEO (UN 1974a; 1974b), but the project's significance transcends the past. Right now, the Progressive International (PI) is seeking to &quot;Renew the Non-Aligned Movement&quot; and &quot;Renovate the NIEO&quot; (Havana Congress 2023). The original project attempted to resolve an uncertain world economic crisis by reaching a global consensus on the reformation of the post-WWII world order, or the rules and institutions of global trade, finance and debt. For example, the <em>Declaration on the Establishment of a NIEO</em> explained that: &quot;Since 1970, the world economy has experienced a series of grave crises which have had severe repercussions, especially on the developing countries because of their generally greater vulnerability to external economic impulses.&quot; It also stated that it had been &quot;impossible to achieve an even and balanced development of the international community under the existing international economic order&quot; (UN 1974a). The passing of the NIEO's founding declarations led to a wholesale reconsideration, across the entire United Nations system, of the global architecture of development. After the &quot;assassination&quot; of the NIEO Project by US imperialist elites (Prashad 2007), these strategic debates were silenced by a neo-colonial &quot;common sense&quot;. For decades, Development Studies and the development industry have largely assumed that &quot;there is no alternative&quot; to neo-liberal globalisation (Berger and Weber 2014, 24-25, 81; Fisher 2009; Prashad 2007, 214-219). The PI's goal of renovating the NIEO is a renewed attempt at creating precisely such alternatives.</p>
<p>Launched in May 2020, the PI is a movement of movements aiming to unite progressive forces globally, and its NIEO campaign is based on a sober assessment of the original. In calling to seize &quot;the opportunity of the present historical juncture&quot;, its <em>Havana Declaration On The NIEO</em> notes that &quot;the crisis of the existing world system can either entrench inequalities or embolden the call to reclaim Southern protagonism&quot; (Havana Congress 2023). This is a lesson from the rise and decline of the solidarity of the original NIEO campaign. Initially, when the Non-Aligned Movement leveraged the new power of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), &quot;Southern protagonism&quot; was emboldened. However, this was eventually crushed during the so-called Third World Debt Crisis. This presents the Progressive International with the problem of understanding, as Yanis Varoufakis (2023) has asked: &quot;Why did we lose last time round?&quot; Unfortunately, the academic literature is still struggling to answer this question. Despite the historical reconsideration of the NIEO that followed Vijay Prashad's pioneering histories of &quot;the Third World Project&quot; (Gilman 2015, 2023; Prashad 2007, 2014; Schwartz 2023), fundamental questions remain about the NIEO's strategic decision making (Thornton 2022; Venzka 2018). This article provides a partial, and broad-brush answer. By relying on the method of C.L.R. James, I trace the counterfactuals –– or imaginary &quot;what if?&quot; scenarios –– that animated two of the NIEO's dominant strategic imaginaries. That is, the imaginary futures which were used to devise and decide between the available options, or strategic choices. I then show how these strategic imaginaries were synthesised, first theoretically and then in practice. This is important, I argue, because the same strategic imaginaries continue to inspire the efforts of the Progressive International to revive the project. This proves, as Nils Gilman (2023) has argued, that the NIEO is a &quot;usable past&quot;. It offers badly needed alternatives to world order and global development.</p>
<p>The question of strategic decision making</p>
<p>By the early 1980s, scholars began to realise that the core proposals of the NIEO would not be implemented. Instead, G77 solidarity crumbled amidst the so-called Third World Debt Crisis (Prashad 2007, 210). In this climate, a strange consensus emerged amongst those who had once viewed it as either a serious threat or opportunity. From the imperialist Henry Kissinger (1982), to the theorist of embedded liberalism, John Ruggie (Bhagwati and Ruggie 1984) and the historical materialist Robert W. Cox (1981), all agreed. The demise of the NIEO proved that it had never stood a chance. This dismissive consensus became the baseline assumption across the social sciences, including in development studies. The pioneering Global Political Economist, Susan Strange, went so far as to describe the NIEO's hopes as &quot;an illusion&quot; (Strange [1988] 2015, 263). In Gilbert Rist's critique of development, he argued that the NIEO's ambivalent proposals do &quot;no more than reinforce the existing order of things&quot; (1999, 49-150). There is nothing wrong with these conclusions, per se. The problem is that they were made without historical research into the decision making which had created and led the NIEO. To prove that the NIEO was powerless, one must understand the available options. Had G77 elites considered choices which, if taken, might have led to more success? In short, no one knew, and until Vijay Prashad's pioneering histories of the &quot;Third World Project&quot; (2007; 2014), no one bothered to find out. Instead, the NIEO's original failure was deemed sufficient evidence to prove its powerlessness. As a result, scholars and practitioners of development have largely ignored this most pivotal moment, and the political strategies that made it possible (For a key exception: Berger and Weber 2014, 14).</p>
<p>This dismissive consensus rested on a rejection of the counterfactual analysis that is essential for making and understanding decisions. Counterfactuals are imagined, &quot;what if?&quot; scenarios. For Robert W. Cox, the rejection of counterfactuals was explicit. He viewed them as &quot;the stuff of idealism rather than of historical materialism&quot; (Cox 1991, 175). Without counterfactual analysis, however, Cox was unable to properly consider the decision making, and therefore power, of the NIEO project. This can be appreciated by considering the method of C.L.R. James, whose groundbreaking research uncovered the previously neglected power that had created and led the Haitian Revolution. In <em>The Black Jacobins</em> ([1938] 1989), James explored the key decisions made by the leaders of global social forces. To do so, he relied extensively on counterfactuals. For example, he analysed not just Napoleon's decision to invade Haiti, but his deeply-considered option not to (James [1938] 1989, 270-271, 373). In doing so, James considered not just what happened, but what <em>might have been if</em> things had been decided differently. This meant imagining entirely different futures for world order (136). For example, James reasoned that with better leadership Napoleon's attack on the nation of freed slaves &quot;would have been crippled at the start&quot; (299-300). From this position of strength the former slave and revolutionary leader, Toussaint, might have succeeded in forming an alliance with the French republic (285). In doing so, James showed how imaginary &quot;what if?&quot; scenarios are foundational to decision making. To choose between option a, b, or c, a person imagines <em>what would happen if</em> each option were taken. To understand the agency that created and led the original NIEO, therefore, it is necessary to search for the counterfactuals that the project relied on, even if implicitly.</p>
<p>Of course, understanding the decision making that created and led the NIEO is difficult (Venzke 2018). As C.L.R. James ([1938] 1989, x) was well aware, decisions are not made in a vacuum. They are embedded within historical forces which people did not choose. The NIEO presents additional difficulties, for it was created by political leaders and diplomats from 95 diverse states, who held contradictory beliefs about the possibilities of changing the post-WWII world order (Thornton 2022; Lal 2015; Byrne 2016). This was shown brilliantly in Adom Getachew's (2019) <em>Worldmaking After Empire</em>, which offers a deep exploration of the NIEO's intellectual foundations. In doing so, Getachew traced the project's ideological contradictions, including the fact that it had been &quot;Marxist in its diagnosis of economic dependence&quot; but liberal in terms of its prescriptions (2019, 145). For Getachew, this was only one of the project's many &quot;internal limitations and inconsistencies&quot;, which were only hidden because &quot;external challenges ensured that the project never had the opportunity for its internal contradictions to unfold&quot; (171). This argument is similar to Cox's original claim that the NIEO lacked &quot;a sufficiently clear view of an alternative world political economy&quot; (Cox 1982, 150-151), and to Henry Kissinger's claim that the NIEO's &quot;philosophical framework seems to me to be extremely elusive&quot; (1982, 153). Others have gone further, arguing that the group's internal contradictions rendered it incapable of negotiating its core demands (Weiss 1986, 6-7, 44-47; Narlikar 2003, 58-69.). In other words, there never were alternative options which G77 elites could have taken.</p>
<p>This theory that the original NIEO had been so marred by internal disagreements, and so lacking in a coherent vision of an alternative, raises the question of how the project had been possible in the first place. How could so many different state elites, with deep ideological and material conflicts, create a global solidarity that forced imperialists –– like Kissinger –– to negotiate? For the astonishing thing about the NIEO is not that it had so many ideological and material contradictions. That is a necessary part of any global solidarity. What is remarkable is that these contradictions were synthesised in praxis. To show this, I draw on C.L.R. James' counterfactual analysis to trace the strategic imaginaries that inspired the decision making of the original NIEO. Of course, it is beyond the scope of this article to consider the many decisions made by each individual G77 elite. Instead, I trace the counterfactual analyses used in two of the NIEO's foundational theories of global development, Kwame Nkrumah's <em>Neocolonialism: The Last Stage of Imperialism</em> (1965), and Raúl Prebisch’s <em>Towards a New Trade Policy For Development</em> (1964). Each text relied on distinct counterfactual claims about what NIEO-style reforms would achieve. Nkrumah saw them as useful for the eventual goal of creating global socialism. Prebisch saw them as temporary measures useful for creating a properly functioning global capitalist system. Nevertheless, at the level of world order Nrkumah's Leninism and Prebisch's liberalism overlapped (Nicholls 2019, 59-61). Even if Nkrumah and Prebisch disagreed about what NIEO-style reforms to world order would achieve, they both supported the reforms (Bockman 2015). Here lies the theoretical basis, I argue, for the non-aligned common front that created and led the original NIEO campaign. This contradictory synthesis allowed the G77 to win support from Leninists to Liberals, and anyone in between. Whether one sought global socialism, or properly-functioning global free trade, there was a historical, and therefore counterfactual, case to be made for NIEO-style reforms.</p>
<p>Of courese, the common front's divergent goals reflected contradictory social forces (Amin 1982, 445; Prashad 2007, 52). By envisioning, and seeking, a properly-functioning global capitalism, Prebisch believed NIEO-style reforms would be equally beneficial to the core and periphery. This implied a strategy of seeking a consensus with capitalist elites in the core. Nkrumah disagreed. He thought the idea that &quot;the developed nations should effectively assist the poorer parts of the world&quot; had &quot;little prospect&quot; of taking place (Nkrumah 1965, xix). He imagined that NIEO-style reforms would be damaging to the interests of imperialists. Thus, instead of seeking global consensus, non-aligned elites should forge collective independence. In practice, both strategies were synthesised. First, OPEC elites acted in accordance with Nkrumah’s strategic vision. Working collectively, they seized control of the global oil market, which heightened the global crisis. Then, this new power was used to call for the Sixth Special Session of the UN General Assembly. There, the G77 acted in accordance with the Prebischian strategy of seeking global consensus. Thus, collective independence that deepened global crisis was used to power the possibility of a global consensus that benefited the North and South alike.</p>
<p>For C.L.R. James, the point of counterfactual analysis was not simply to understand the history of past decision making. It was to use this history to inform strategic decision making in the present. For James, this meant asking not just what could have been decided, but what should have been (James [1938] 1989, 282). It is for this purpose that Yanis Varoufakis (2023) has called on the PI to ask itself: &quot;Why did we lose last time round?&quot; Curiously, similar questions were asked by Samir Amin (1982) during the project's demise. Despite agreeing with the emerging consensus that the NIEO had been powerless, Amin embraced counterfactual analysis. This allowed him to ask key questions of the project's praxis, including whether it had failed because of &quot;tactical errors&quot;, or unpredictable economic contingencies (Amin 1982, 436). For Amin, there was nothing that G77 elites could have done to avoid the destruction brought in the wake of the NIEO. In fact, he thought the G77's &quot;common front&quot; had been dangerous. As such, this article starts with Amin.</p>
<p>Samir Amin's Leninist Rejection of the NIEO</p>
<p>Despite contributing to the scholarly consensus that the NIEO's failure was inevitable, Samir Amin's historical materialism did not ignore questions of the project's decision making. He asked whether &quot;the factors behind the clearly visible failure&quot; were &quot;purely contingent&quot; aspects of the economic crisis, or &quot;traceable to the 'tactical errors' of the Third World&quot; (Amin 1982, 436). Amin could consider decision making because he was open to counterfactual analysis (Patomäki 2019). Indeed, his answer to these questions drew upon an imaginary &quot;what if?&quot; scenario. He asked what it would mean if the G77 succeeded in &quot;transforming this dependency relationship and compelling the adjustment of the world system&quot;:</p>
<p>If that should turn out to be the case one should be able to look back on imperialism as merely a stage - an intermediate stage - in the expansion of capitalism on a world scale and not as the highest stage of capitalism; it would have proved, that is, as the stage that ushered in the transition from a system characterised by the asymmetrical centre-periphery relationships that define it to a homogeneous global system dominated by capitalist relations. (Amin 1982, 441-2)</p>
<p>In this sense, the NIEO project was an important experiment, which tested the nature of imperialism itself. To explain why he thought the project could never have succeeded, Amin constructed a theoretically consistent account of imperialism, understood as a stage of capitalism dominated by global monopoly capital. Within this Leninist imaginary, the G77's &quot;common front&quot; was defined by its ruling classes (Amin 1982, 445). Thus, whereas some advocates described the G77 as a group of &quot;proletarian nations&quot;, or a &quot;trade union of the poor&quot; (Getachew 2019, 168; Sauvant 2014, 9; Moyn 2019, 103-104), Amin defined them as a group of &quot;peripheral capitalist states and their bourgeoisies&quot; (Amin 1982, 432). In their struggle to industrialise, the peripheral bourgeoisies were opposed by &quot;the monopolies and the imperialist states&quot;. Despite this resistance to the core, Amin noted that the NIEO &quot;permits an increase in the rate of profit on a world scale and can only be read therefore, as a contribution to global capitalist development.&quot; What's more, Amin pointed to the problem of &quot;sub-imperialism&quot; within the G77, and argued that the NIEO had the &quot;effect of turning the Third World into a fair game for the rival superpowers&quot; (1982, 447-8).</p>
<p>Despite imagining the NIEO as both dangerous and ultimately powerless, Amin did not, like other historical materialists, ignore non-Western agency (Hobson and Sajed 2017). To explain the &quot;atmosphere&quot; which had made it &quot;possible to contemplate&quot; a NIEO, Amin pointed to a global upsurge of popular forces across the global South (1982, 439; see also: Berger and Weber 2014, 70-71; Prashad 2007, 2014), and predicted a &quot;new wave of popular struggles&quot; (447-448). Citing the anti-colonial revolutions that had created the post-WWII world order, Amin looked towards the future. &quot;Not for the first time,&quot; he argued, &quot;the peoples of the Third World may well lead the process of world transformation&quot; (447-448). This critique has devastating implications for the Progressive International (PI). If Amin is right, their is no point in attempting to &quot;Renovate the NIEO&quot;. Instead, the PI would be better placed to focus solely on the development of domestic, and revolutionary social forces. However, other counterfactuals are possible.</p>
<p>The strategic imaginary of Kwame Nkrumah</p>
<p>Nkrumah agreed with Amin that imperialism was the final stage of capitalism. His classic work on neo-colonialism had not revised Lenin's theory, but applied it to the post-WWII world order, a point which Nkrumah made explicit:</p>
<p>Colonialism has achieved a new guise. It has become neo-colonialism, the last stage of imperialism; its final bid for existence, as monopoly-capitalism or imperialism is the last stage of capitalism. (1965, 31)</p>
<p>Thus, like Amin, Nkrumah understood the task of economic development in the periphery as a struggle against &quot;the empire of finance capital&quot; (35-36). Unlike Amin, Nkrumah (1965, 32) adopted a working relationship with this empire, arguing that &quot;it is impossible for any of us to avoid dealing with monopoly in some form or another.&quot; He believed that with international solidarity, non-aligned state elites could &quot;maintain the integrity of our financial institutions&quot; and &quot;leave ourselves room to manoeuvre away&quot; from neo-colonialism (Nkrumah 1965, 32). Here, his focus was on pan-Africanism, but he also supported &quot;a strengthening of the Afro-Asian Solidarity Organisation and the spirit of Bandung&quot;, as well as solidarity &quot;on an increasingly formal basis&quot; with &quot;our Latin American brothers&quot; (Nkrumah 1965, 253-254). Thus, whereas Amin criticised the NIEO's common-front strategy, Nkrumah helped create it. He argued that newly-independent states must act &quot;in a combination that will give strength to our bargaining power and eliminate so many of the duplications that give greater force and greater advantage to the imperialists and their strategy of neo-colonialism&quot; (Nkrumah 1965, 30-31).</p>
<p>In calling for international solidarity, Nkrumah –– like other socialists –– had not opposed foreign direct investment or free trade (Biney 2011, 108; Bockman 2015). Indeed, he had imagined global reforms that would become key pillars of the NIEO. Besides calling to overthrow neo-colonialism (UNGA 1974b, Chapter II, Section 1(a): i-xii), the founding declarations called for:</p>
<p>aid to be distributed multilaterally (Nkrumah 1965, xv-xvi; UNGA 1974a, para. 4 (k));</p>
<p>a &quot;continental code to govern foreign investment&quot; (Nkrumah 1965, 257; UNGA 1974b, Section V); and</p>
<p>support for increased free trade (Nkrumah 1965, 9; UNGA 1974b, Section I 3. (ii)).</p>
<p>Nkrumah did not believe these reforms would succeed in isolation, but thought they would be useful. By mitigating the worst effects of imperialism, these proposals would boost economic development in the periphery, and heighten the contradiction between capital and labour in the imperial core (Nkrumah 1965, 255-256). Lenin ([1917] 2008) had argued that monopolistic &quot;superprofits&quot; allowed imperialists to &quot;bribe the labour leaders and the upper stratum of the labour aristocracy.&quot; Nkrumah built on this directly, reasoning that any mitigation of superprofits would heighten class conflict in the core:</p>
<p>When Africa becomes economically free and politically united, the monopolists will come face to face with their own working class in their own countries, and a new struggle will arise within which the liquidation and collapse of imperialism will be complete. (1965, 255-256)</p>
<p>Of course, Nkrumah never imagined that this would be possible solely with NIEO-style reforms. Nor did he imagine that they would be won through diplomatic consensus (Getachew 2009, 149-150). Within his imaginary, NIEO-style reforms would damage the interests of imperialist elites. As such, Nkrumah focused on building non-aligned coalitions, and regional ordering, like his proposed &quot;All-African Union Government&quot; (Nkrumah 1965, 35-36; Getachew 2019, 102). This was justified by his counterfactual analysis, or strategic imaginary. For if NIEO-style reforms would assist economic development in the periphery while heightening class contradictions in the imperial core, then there was little chance of imperialist concessions. Instead, non-aligned elites would have to create NIEO-style reforms and institutions themselves. Importantly, this aspect of Nkrumah's <em>Neo-colonialism</em> isn't found in the NIEO's founding declarations. These claimed that the NIEO would be just as beneficial to the core as to the periphery. Nkrumah's strategic imaginary should be understood as operating beneath the surface of these formal, diplomatic documents. Indeed, his strategy of collective independence was a core part of the Non-Aligned Movement. As I show bellow, it was this collective independence that had underlined the NIEO's initial moment of possibility.</p>
<p>Raúl Prebisch's strategy of a liberal consensus</p>
<p>Whereas Nkrumah imagined NIEO-style reforms as useful for creating global socialism, Prebisch believed they would help create a global capitalism that functioned as it was already supposed to. As his report as the founding Secretary General of UNCTAD made clear, Prebisch sought to achieve this by reforming the post-WWII Bretton Woods system from within. Take, for example, his criticism of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), the precursor to the World Trade Organisation (WTO). Prebisch didn't oppose its core goal of promoting free trade, but its historical blindness. It ignored the fact that the benefits of free trade did not apply between &quot;the industrially advanced and the developing countries&quot; (Prebisch 1964, 29; Bockman 2015, 115). For, as Prebisch established alongside Hans Singer, exports from the periphery showed a long-term tendency to decline relative to their industrial imports (Toye 2003). Thus, if the GATT's rules and norms were applied equally between the core and periphery, they would constrain, rather than help, economic development (Prebisch 1964). To amend this, Prebisch sought to unify the newly-formed G77 behind a set of reforms aimed at supporting peripheral industrialisation (Dosman 2008, 394-395). These measures included a real transfer of wealth from the core to the periphery and the establishment of commodity agreements to regulate and increase the price of peripheral exports. Like Nkrumah, Prebisch never believed that these reforms would be sufficient. He made this point with a counterfactual, imagining that:</p>
<p>If the peripheral countries manage to secure a larger share for their primary exports in the consumption of the industrial countries, this, together with the transfer of income from the latter countries to the former to offset the effects of the deterioration in the terms of trade, will help to narrow the trade gap but will not in itself be enough to close it. (Prebisch 1964, 20)</p>
<p>What's more, none of Prebisch's proposed reforms were intended to be permanent (1964, 31). As peripheral industrialisation grew, the &quot;disparity&quot; with the core &quot;can be levelled out gradually&quot; (Prebisch 1964, 31). Indeed, Prebisch wrote that: &quot;With an effort of the imagination it is possible to visualise a situation of dynamic equilibrium in the distant future in which [the declining terms of trade] disappears as a result of the world-wide process of industrialization&quot; (Prebisch 1964, 15).</p>
<p>Here lies the biggest difference between Prebisch and Nkrumah. For Prebisch, NIEO-style reforms would not significantly threaten the profits of state elites from the global North. For these were not radical nor permanent reforms, and would have the effect of increasing economic development in both the core and periphery. This had important strategic implications. If true, the G77 could create global reforms to world order through &quot;joint responsibilities, common objectives, and convergent measures&quot; (Prebisch 1984, 183). This strategic imaginary was a fundamental part the NIEO's founding declarations, which claimed that it would help both North and South alike (UN 1974a). It also shaped the G77's legal strategy, which sought to reform the United Nations from within, on the basis of global consensus (Bedjaoui 1979, 196-197). It is this moderate tendency that scholars have used to describe the NIEO as an essentially &quot;Keynesian liberal&quot; project (Murphy 2005, 12; see also: Helleiner 2016).</p>
<p>Decision making: the strategic imaginaries in practice</p>
<p>So far, this article has shown that Nkrumah and Prebisch contributed conflicting visions of what NIEO-style reforms would achieve, and how they could be created. The more radical strategy of collective independence was promoted within the NAM, which Nkrumah helped found (Sauvant 2014, 5). The more moderate strategy of seeking a global consensus was promoted within UNCTAD, which Prebisch helped found, and the G77 (Prebisch 1984, 183). In this section, I turn to consider how these strategies related to the rise and decline of the original NIEO. In key turning points, how did G77 elites choose between the options made available by these two strategic traditions? I argue that the NIEO was created by a non-aligned common front that was originally empowered by a synthesis of both strategies. Initially, in late 1973, Western elites used the petrodollar crisis as a pretext to end the IMF's &quot;radical&quot; attempt at creating &quot;a quantum jump into a new [monetary] system&quot; (IMF 1972, 4; De Vries 1985, 240-242). In response, Algerian president Houari Boumédiène leveraged OPEC's new power to call for the Sixth Special Session, where decisions would be made on all matters of global development (Sauvant 2014, 5). In this way, the strategy of collective independence, via the NAM and OPEC, was used to empower the strategy of reaching a global consensus within the UN General Assembly (UNGA 1974).</p>
<p>This strategic synthesis, which empowered the NIEO's initial moment of possibility, peaked at the Seventh Special Session in September 1975. At this time, the world economic crisis had been marked by continued uncertainty, and a decline in the value of the recently-floated US-dollar. This reduced the value of OPEC's petrodollar surpluses, and made OPEC's (1975) <em>Solemn Declaration</em> all the more believable. In it, OPEC heads of state explicitly tied their oil and financial power to the goal of a NIEO. This had an obvious effect. In the lead up to the Seventh Special Session, CIA analysts feared what they called &quot;the radicals, led by Algeria&quot; (CIA 1975). Because the radicals wanted &quot;a big transfer of resources&quot; and &quot;have a lot of power&quot;, the CIA argued that a &quot;compromise may need to be struck in regards to commodities&quot;. This accords with Kissinger's strategy at the Special Session, which projected what appeared like a genuine willingness to compromise (Gosovic and Ruggie 1976; Sargent 2015; Dietrich 2017, 284-289). However, by the end of the Paris Conference on International Economic Cooperation (CIEC) in 1977, the exchange rate of the US-dollar seemed to have stabilised. As OPEC's capital appeared relatively more stable within a US-led order, the option of investing in the NIEO became relatively more risky (Nicholls 2019, 146-149). Through massive increases in US arms sales, Iran and Saudi Arabia chose instead to strengthen ties with imperialism (Brzoska and Ohlson 1987, pp. 343-348; Dietrich 2017, 298-301; Prashad 2007, 186-189; Wright 2014). As a result, US negotiators dropped their apparent willingness to compromise. Indeed, at the CIEC, they dismissed all concerns about the growing debt crisis, claiming that it would fix itself (UNA 1976; Nicholls 2019, 150-151). With the conference ending in failure, G77 solidarity collapsed.</p>
<p>The rise and decline of this original strategic synthesis raises two counterfactual questions. First, as Samir Amin considered in 1982, is the question of unpredictable economic contingencies. What if the economic crisis had deepened, from 1975-1977, rather than apparently stabilising? Would key OPEC elites have then been more likely to finance experiments in the NIEO, like UNCTAD's proposed Common Fund? Even if the Common Fund failed to underlie a new wave of commodity price agreements, it seems likely that significant OPEC investment would have boosted G77 solidarity, for it would have legitimised the strategic synthesis that had made the NIEO project possible in the first place. Secondly, if G77 solidarity had been strengthened before the debt crisis, could the group have formed a debtors' cartel, as proposed by Cuba? (Prashad 2007, 214-219) The counterfactual of a debtors' cartel is tantalising because of how close the world economic crisis came, even without a cartel, to collapsing the US financial system (Corbridge 1993, 44-45; Helleiner 1996, 176; Mazower 2013, 351). To avoid a collapse, US state and financial elites employed their own strategy of collective independence, wielding the full weight of their monopoly finance capital to quash economic development in South America and Africa for over a decade (Bazbauers and Engel 2021; Easterly 2001; Harvey 2005, 29; Prashad 2014, 5-7; Stewart 2012, 88, 92). With a debtors' cartel, things might have happened differently. By risking a systemic collapse of the still-bourgeoning neo-liberal world disorder, a debtors' cartel could have forced the North-South dialogue back to the future of the early 1970s, when most global elites still supported some form of reformed Bretton Woods (De Vries 1985, 242-243, 255-256). Thus, again, the strategic synthesis between the NIEO's more radical, non-aligned strategy, and its more moderate, consensus-seeking strategy, would have helped decide the future of world order, and global development.</p>
<p>Of course, such counterfactual scenarios are imaginary, so can't be tested with historical research. Still, as C.L.R. James argued, the point of analysing historical decision making is not just to understand what actually could have been decided, but to understand what &quot;should&quot; have been ([1938]1989, 282). It is only through such questions that consciousness can use the past to guide decision making in the present. This is made clear in the lead up to the Progressive International's 2024 Havana Congress, when it asked: &quot;Should we form a club of debtor nations to navigate the crisis of sovereign debt?&quot; This fits a more general tendency within the movement towards the NIEO's Nkrumahist strategic tradition. By acknowledging that the original NIEO &quot;was won through the exercise of collective power in the coordinated production of petroleum&quot;, the PI declares that its own &quot;vision today can only be realized through the collective action of the South&quot;. To explore such strategic possibilities, Michael Galant (2024) considered the history of the original NIEO, and concluded that &quot;even a united negotiating front is only as strong as its underlying balance of power&quot;. For Galant, a member of the PI's Executive Committee, the implication is that the movement must create &quot;South-South collective action&quot; in the form of a &quot;new critical minerals cartel&quot; and a &quot;club of debtor nations&quot;. As these statements make clear, the Progressive International's current attempts at renovating the NIEO are based on a reconsideration of the exact strategies that were sorely missed during the demise of the original. The PI knows that it is not enough to simply seek a global consensus.</p>
<p>Still, the PI has not, for this reason, ignored the NIEO's more Prebischian goals and strategies. Its <em>Havana Declaration</em> (2023) calls for a global consensus, or a &quot;Planetary Bloc&quot; supported by &quot;all peoples and nations&quot;. Perhaps most interestingly, however, is the fact that some of the PI's leaders are drawing –– even if unwittingly –– on parts of Samir Amin's critique of the NIEO. Within the eclectic imaginaries of Yanis Varoufakis, the historical echos of both Prebisch and Amin can be heard in a new strategic synthesis. Like Amin's critique of &quot;sub-imperialism&quot; within the G77, Varoufakis (2023) has argued the the PI &quot;must not repeat the mistake&quot; of relying on &quot;the elites of the Global South&quot;. He made this point with a counterfactual, arguing that: &quot;Our New Non-Aligned Movement will fail if we give it a narrow role of bringing together the G77 and the BRICS in opposition to the West.&quot; Varoufakis also reflects the NIEO's more moderate goals, even as Prebisch is sidelined for &quot;Green Keynesianism&quot; (See also: Schwartz 2023). While believing like Prebisch that such reforms would address capitalist crises, Varoufakis is skeptical that the capitalist class will support &quot;the very road that leads to its own salvation.&quot; Instead, he calls for “Genuine democracy” that will “be practised in the citizens’ and the workers’ assemblies; not behind closed doors where secretive oligarchs gather.” This is indicative of a key trend within the PI's &quot;renovation&quot; of the NIEO. In this new, still somewhat implicit strategy, the PI is attempting to empower a NIEO from below, via the its movement of movements, or grass roots social forces.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>By focusing on the counterfactuals used by Amin, Nkrumah and Prebisch, this article traced the broad strategies that underlined the original NIEO, and which continue to shape the PI's efforts to &quot;renovate&quot; the project. This is important for both development studies and the development industry, which have largely assumed that &quot;there is no alternative&quot; to neo-liberal globalisation. The history of the original NIEO, and the work of the PI, challenges these assumptions, for both projects reflect real alternatives, or different strategic options. The original NIEO failed, but it also succeeded. It succeeded in creating a global solidarity which possessed powerful decision making options. Its unique strategic synthesis continues to pose important &quot;what if?s&quot;: what might have been possible then and what might be possible now? As the NIEO was crushed during a global debt crisis, the PI reconsiders the possibilities of a debtors' cartel. In this way, the history of the NIEO continues to present alternative choices. To ignore this is to ignore the past, present and possible futures of neo-colonialism, global capitalism, and –– indeed –– &quot;development&quot;.</p>
