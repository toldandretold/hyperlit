<p class="NoIndent">A generation later, I have little to add to the preface which I wrote for the second edition. In 1945 <span class="italic">The Twenty Years’ Crisis</span> was already a period piece, and such it remains. But it was an attempt to navigate then relatively uncharted waters; and, though its observations were cast in the mould of a brief historical period (as all general observations tend to be), they perhaps retain a wider interest and significance. The reflexions on nationalism in the last paragraph of my 1945 preface have been qualified, but not altogether falsified, by the unforeseen emergence of mutually antagonistic superpowers.</p>
