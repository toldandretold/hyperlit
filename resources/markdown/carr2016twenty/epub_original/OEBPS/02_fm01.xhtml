<p class="chapterTitle1">Endorsements for This Book</p>
<p class="NoIndent">‘In the twentieth century, E.H. Carr was one of the most original and interesting thinkers about International Relations. Carr’s insights into the nature of international affairs warrant attention. Everyone interested in international politics should read this book.’</p>
<p class="paraRight">—<span class="bold">Robert Gilpin</span>, <span class="italic">Eisenhower Professor Emeritus of Public and International Affairs, Princeton University</span></p>
<p class="NoIndent"> </p>
<p class="NoIndent">‘<span class="italic">The Twenty Years’ Crisis</span> is one of those books that somehow never goes out of date. It brings into sharp focus a lot of core questions that anyone grappling with the complexities of International Relations needs to confront, and it sets a standard of clarity and vigour of prose that has few competitors in the contemporary IR literature.’</p>

<p class="NoIndent">‘Apparently overtaken by events in the very days of its first publication, Carr’s <span class="italic">The Twenty Years Crisis</span> has never been more pertinent to the discussion of International Relations relations than it is today: in a world beset by the twin extremes which he excoriated, a craven and short-sighted realism on the one hand, and an unanchored and irresponsible idealism on the other, Carr’s astute arguments should be central to our analysis of, and response to, the world of the twenty-first century.’</p>
<p class="paraRight">—<span class="bold">Fred Halliday</span></p>
<p class="NoIndent"> </p>
<p class="NoIndent">‘Now is the time to relaunch <span class="italic">The Twenty Years’ Crisi</span>s as a basis for rethinking the problem of world order in a time of greater complexity and uncertainty. [Carr’s] exposure of the power relations underlying doctrines of the harmony of interests is especially pertinent to a serious understanding of the ideology of globalization today, while his careful discussion of the need to balance power and morality warns against the hypocrisy of contemporary great-power crusading.’</p>
