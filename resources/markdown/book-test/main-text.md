# A Non-Aligned Comommon Front: Strategic Imaginaries of the New International Economicrder #

>**Abstract**

>Fifty years after the Sixth Special Session, the Progressive
International has declared a strategy of \'rebuilding the Non-Aligned
movement\', and \'renovating the NIEO\'. However, key questions remain
about the praxis of the original. The draft declarations of the
programme of action and declaration on the establishment of a NIEO were
brought to the UN by the leaders of 95 states, caucused as the G77.
There proposals and strategies, therefore, were inherently plural. This
begs the question of how such a \'common front\' had even been possible.
This article offers a partial answer by exploring the strategic
imaginaries that underlined the project. It first establishes that the
Leninist ideas of Kwame Nkrumah and the liberal ideas of Raúl Prebisch
converged at the level of world order. Then, by drawing on the work of
Mohammed Bedjaoui, <mark><a href="/hyper-lights#2ad8a7049d7c5511ac254f5f51fe70a046ebd884729056f0fe57f5160d467153" id="2ad8a7049d7c5511ac254f5f51fe70a046ebd884729056f0fe57f5160d467153">it</a></mark> shows that these contradictory tendencies were
successfully synthesised in practice.

known, because the core proposals of the NIEO were never tested in
practice. Still, as <mark><a href="/hyper-lights#260d6be957b873756ce8a561e252616683c5a26d81d6625e1550d0415797bef4" id="260d6be957b873756ce8a561e252616683c5a26d81d6625e1550d0415797bef4">C.L.R. James</a></mark> showed in *The* *Black Jacobins*,
imaginary \'what if?\' scenarios are foundational to all strategic
decision making. To decide how to act, people imagine *what would happen
if* each option was taken. To understand the strategic decision making
of the NIEO, then, is to consider the project\'s strategic imaginaries.
How did G77 elites imagine a successful NIEO? A full answer to this
question is beyond the scope of this article. Here, I consider the
strategies of the NIEO more broadly, by focusing on on its intellectual
foundations. <ins>*The Declaration*</ins> and <ins>*Programme of Action*</ins> drew on two
distinct, but intertwined, praxes: Kwame Nkrumah\'s critique of
neo-colonialism and Raúl Prebisch\'s work on the declining terms of
trade. These organic intellectuals agreed on the need for liberal
reforms to world order. However, they did so for entirely different
reasons. Whereas Nkrumah imagined NIEO-style reforms as useful for
global socialism, Prebisch sought a global capitalism that worked as its
neo-classical boosters already believed it did. This strategic pluralism
allowed the G77 to forge global agreement amongst ideologically diverse
state elites. In this sense, the NIEO was a truly Non-Aligned \'common
front\'.[^1^](#fn1){#fnref1 .footnote-ref role="doc-noteref"}
