<h1><strong>Chapter 10: A New NIEO?: global economic justice and planetary boundaries</strong></h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The previous chapter focusing on BRICS, perhaps, at times gave the impression that there were no initiatives similar to, and following on from, the NIEO, and that the voice of the Global South went largely unheard for almost thirty years until the economic and financial crisis of 2008. This chapter corrects this story somewhat by looking, in turn, at two initiatives in the 1980s for a kind of “NIEO light”, one an agreement between the Nordic countries and countries in Southern Africa, and the other a report by the Socialist International. The focus then turns to the work of the South Commission led by Julius Nyerere, particularly <em>The Challenge to the South</em> published in 1990. It then moves on to address explicit attempts to reformulate the NIEO for today's conditions, envisioning a way out of the current global economic and political crisis through revisiting questions of commodity pricing, access to technology and technological knowledge, patents and intellectual property rights, energy consumption and fragile ecosystems, and structural indebtedness.</p>
<p>In terms of contemporary initiatives, the focus is on two programmatic statements of what a new NIEO might look like. The first, “A Plan to Save the Planet”, takes inspiration from the South Commission, and addresses the interlocking apartheids of money, medicine and food. The second, The Progressive International’s Havana Declaration and subsequent initiatives, utilizing Cuba’s chairing of the G77, focuses on technological developments and the need to avoid environmental collapse. The chapter concludes that, whilst the NIEO can inspire, how to update the content of the NIEO to respond to global crises is, in many ways, a lesser challenge than envisioning how real change in the global ecological, economic, social and political order might come about, not least given the contrast in scale and influence between today’s initiatives and those around the original NIEO.</p>
<p>Nils Gilman’s borrowing of Wenzel’s notion of “unfailure”<sup id="fnref1:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref">1</a></sup> helps to frame the chapter, suggesting that “although the historically specific institutional demands” of the NIEO were not achieved, a case can be made that “the undead spirit” of the NIEO and, indeed, NWICO “continue to haunt international relations” <sup id="fnref1:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref">2</a></sup> and understandings of global political economy and global governance to date. The sense of haunting, in Sara Salem’s terms, “helps think through the blurry edges between time and space” and challenges “the idea that anti-colonial pasts reside in the past”<sup id="fnref1:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref">3</a></sup>. In a recent text on the NIEO, Gilman traces an upsurge in interest, both academic and political, in the NIEO as “part of the search for the reconstruction of a “usable past” that can ground the imagining of a new post-neoliberal global economic system”<sup id="fnref1:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref">4</a></sup>. In his seminal text almost a decade earlier, he noted the importance of “the NIEO’s unfailed political imaginary of a more just and egalitarian order”<sup id="fnref1:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref">5</a></sup>. It is elements of the history of this imaginary from the early 1980s until the present that we trace in this chapter.</p>
<h2>A Mini-NIEO? Nordic-Southern African Development Co-Operation</h2>
<p>In the aftermath of the impossibility of implementing the NIEO in its totality, an important initiative emerged in the early 1980s, culminating in January 1986 in a Joint Declaration on Expanded Economic and Cultural Cooperation Between the Nordic Countries and the SADCC Member States. The Declaration was signed by the five Nordic states (Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden) and the nine member states of SADCC, the Southern African Development Coordination Conference (Angola, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Swaziland, Tanzania, Zambia, and Zimbabwe). Although some commentators suggested that the initiative “was not a response to the NIEO debate” but, rather “a logical continuation at a regional level of the Nordic countries’ bilateral aid programmes with individual SADCC countries”<sup id="fnref1:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref">6</a></sup>, it was often dubbed “a mini-NIEO”, a concept first used by the Norwegian international relations scholar and liberal politician Helge Hveem<sup id="fnref1:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref">7</a></sup>.</p>
<p>In his important, recent, forensic re-examination of the initiative, Carl Marklund frames it as “a purposive downscaling of the NIEO”, albeit an attempt to “recast future North-South relations” based on Swedish, and broader Nordic, solidaristic internationalism, global social reformism and a degree of self-interest and future proofing<sup id="fnref1:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref">8</a></sup>. Although the initiative builds on the initial, albeit contradictory, support for the NIEO from the so-called Like-Minded Group of countries discussed in chapter four, it was made possible by the formal founding of the SADCC in April 1980. The founding of SADCC linked the struggle for global economic justice firmly and explicitly with what was termed the “economic liberation” of the sub-continent from “the economic hegemony of South Africa” and its apartheid regime that worked, explicitly, to destabilise the so-called “frontline states” in the struggle against apartheid whilst simultaneously locking them into new forms of economic dependency. SADCC’s founding declaration, seeing the nine states and the occupied territory of Namibia as subject to colonial and sub-colonial power structures and requiring forms of regional integration, not least integrated transport and communications systems, supported by untied external development assistance, to achieve economic self-reliance, planned industrialization, and self-sufficiency in food<sup id="fnref1:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref">9</a></sup>, clearly echoes some of the language and policy frames of the NIEO.</p>
<p>For the Nordic countries, particularly Sweden, Norway and Finland<sup id="fnref1:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref">10</a></sup>, a mini-NIEO project served to keep elements of the NIEO alive and, indeed, appeared to offer an opportunity both to narrow the gap between rhetoric and reality and, at the same time, to tone down some aspects of the NIEO that remained unpalatable even to social democratic internationalist regimes in the Global North. Co-operation with the SADCC served to underpin Nordic commitments to the struggle against apartheid. The five-year agreement made sense not least given that the Nordic countries accounted for around one third of OECD development assistance to the region<sup id="fnref1:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref">11</a></sup>. It also constituted, very much, a “testing ground” for moving “beyond aid” by incorporating a more holistic understanding of development to include trade and investment. SADCC’s flexibility appealed to the Nordic governments, as well as its commitment to integrated forms of industrialization and infrastructure. As Marklund points out, politicians, civil servants, activists and scholars of “futurology”, particularly in Sweden, could find common cause in a kind of “enlightened self-interest” that could satisfy, to an extent, Global South demands for more equitable trade relations with “a window of opportunity … aiming at diversifying capital markets, energy supply and foreign trade”<sup id="fnref1:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref">12</a></sup> for the developed Nordic states.</p>
<p>The contradictions and challenges of the initiative were numerous. Given that, in 1984, the combined GDP of the SADCC countries was only about 8% of the Nordic countries’ GDP, and that the GDP per capita ratio was close to 33:1<sup id="fnref1:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote-ref">13</a></sup>, there was a real danger of replacing the SADCC countries’ dependency on South Africa with a new dependency on Nordic aid. Indeed, despite the rhetoric of economic liberation and collective self-reliance, SADCC was set up explicitly “as a vehicle for soliciting foreign financial and technical support”<sup id="fnref1:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote-ref">14</a></sup> and never fully escaped this straitjacket. The extent to which the Nordic countries wanted “to secure a foothold in the SADCC region because they need(ed) its mineral raw materials for their own capital goods industries”<sup id="fnref1:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote-ref">15</a></sup> is, perhaps, debatable. At the same time, the “mini-NIEO” initiative was less clear than the original NIEO about the need to curb the activities of multinational corporations on which Sweden, in particular, relied. In a sense, the initiative can be seen as leading, over time, to a greater emphasis on voluntary agreements regarding multinational corporations, allowing for joint ventures in large scale infrastructure alongside a focus on smaller-scale artisan-like projects that do not directly compete with capital goods from the Nordic countries. A kind of “diversified dependence”<sup id="fnref1:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote-ref">16</a></sup> was being created in which the SADCC region would continue to export primary commodities and import manufactured goods, the very conditions that the NIEO had sought to challenge.</p>
<p>In the context of a severe debt crisis, foreign exchange shortages and declining living standards, the initiative does not appear to have been capable of challenging the continued emphasis from the IMF and World Bank on neo-liberal prescriptions in terms of “structural adjustment”, consisting of the familiar mix of “state expenditure cuts, wage freezes, currency devaluations and economic liberalisation as pre-conditions for loans”<sup id="fnref1:17"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote-ref">17</a></sup>, even as this led to unrest in many of the countries most affected. A more difficult question is, of course, the extent to which Nordic capitalism was being folded into the more neoliberal policies of the IFIs, the United States and the European Union.</p>
<h2>Global Challenge: Enter the Socialist International</h2>
<p>The report <em>Global Challenge From Crisis to Cooperation: Breaking the North-South Stalemate</em><sup id="fnref1:18"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote-ref">18</a></sup>, a result of work by the Committee on Economic Policy of the Socialist International (SICEP), chaired by former, and future, Jamaican Prime Minister Michael Manley, was published in 1985. Although it received very little attention at the time and, certainly, failed to impact the terrain of global governance, it is worth revisiting as an important text not unrelated to the Nordic-SADCC initiative to which it makes reference. The Socialist International (SI), originally formed in the 19^th^ century was, when re-established in 1951, composed of representatives from Western European social democratic, labour and democratic socialist parties and trades unions<sup id="fnref1:19"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote-ref">19</a></sup>. At its Congress in 1976, coinciding with the height of the NIEO debate, the SI under its newly elected President, former German Chancellor Willy Brandt, supported by Swedish Prime Minister Olaf Palme, and Austrian Chancellor Bruno Kreisky, reoriented the SI both in terms of membership, particularly bringing in socialist parties and experts from Latin America and the Caribbean, and thematically, focusing much more on issues of justice, solidarity and peace within a potential new global order.</p>
<p>Brandt had a long-standing interest in seeking “to forge a middle ground between the NIEO’s principles and the economic interests of Western industrialized countries”, considering elements of the NIEO project and CERDS, particularly those relating to nationalization of natural resources and economic activities without compensation, as “too radical”<sup id="fnref1:20"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote-ref">20</a></sup>. The continuities between the SI report and the earlier work of the Brandt Commission, discussed in Chapter 4, is all too clear, not least in the iconography of the covers; the Brandt Commission’s drawing of a world map with a dividing line between the North and the South is re-used in <em>Global Challenge</em> but with the two parts of the world now separated from each other, indicating the element of crisis. According to Fulla, the drive to produce <em>Global Challenge</em> can be traced to the 1982 Vienna Conference of the SI, where Kreisky called for “a Marshall plan for the South” and Brandt for an emergency programme to address the crisis in North-South relations. A few months later Michael Manley was appointed as head of the SICEP and the work of the Manley Committee began<sup id="fnref1:21"><a href="#fn:21" class="footnote-ref">21</a></sup>. For Getachew, Manley, along with Julius Nyerere, belonged to “a second generation of anticolonial worldmakers”<sup id="fnref1:22"><a href="#fn:22" class="footnote-ref">22</a></sup>, who developed distinctive socialist projects akin to what Davis in relation to Manley describes as a “concentric circles” approach to international relations based on collective self-reliance, domestically, regionally, in the Global South, and globally through the NIEO<sup id="fnref1:23"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote-ref">23</a></sup>. As also noted in Chapter 4, Manley, Nyerere and Kenneth Kaunda were committed to pursuing the NIEO agenda in any and all arenas, including the Commonwealth. In the SI, as interest in the NIEO waned, the Manley Committee sought to repackage ideas from the NIEO, combined with a wider range of initiatives<sup id="fnref1:24"><a href="#fn:24" class="footnote-ref">24</a></sup>, as a way of rethinking North-South relations, involving the socialist East more, and offering ideas for Western social democracy to break the stranglehold of neoliberalism.</p>
<p>Running to over 200 pages in its final published version, the report compares the crippling economic crisis facing the world with the situation in the 1930s, implicitly drawing connections with the spectre of Fascism. It focuses on redressing structural imbalances and, above all, the crippling debt crisis facing much of the Global South and follows the “Out of Crisis” report in calling for “vast structural, social and spatial redistribution”<sup id="fnref1:25"><a href="#fn:25" class="footnote-ref">25</a></sup> to overcome increasing polarization, in the North as well as the South. The interlinked problems of “the domination of the world economy by a handful of giant transnational corporations” and the imposition of “conservative and monetarist policies” by the IMF and the United States could only be solved, the argument went, by the “progressive implementation” of the NIEO, in the long-term interests of the North and based on the responsibilities of the South in terms of South-South cooperation and “the creation of new capacity for production”<sup id="fnref1:26"><a href="#fn:26" class="footnote-ref">26</a></sup>. An increase in global spending, quantified at some \$100 billion per year, would be needed that should involve massive multi-scalar redistribution, not least in terms of channelling expenditure to social infrastructure and away from the global arms race. Although this was not a manifesto for complete disarmament, the report criticised “a world arms budget which is over a third of the GDP of Third World countries”, suggesting that “for ten per cent of what the world now spends on arms each year, we could begin a process of recovery and achieve a decade of development for North and South alike”<sup id="fnref1:27"><a href="#fn:27" class="footnote-ref">27</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Influenced, according to Fulla, by proposals from Latin American socialists, the report called for a mixture of debt forgiveness, moratoria, conversion, and rescheduling seeking long-term, integrated, multilateral solutions and, above all, “relating debt restructuring to the restructuring of trade in such a way as to increase the earning capacity of the debtor countries”<sup id="fnref1:28"><a href="#fn:28" class="footnote-ref">28</a></sup>. The report also made proposals for commodity price stabilization, including the strengthening of existing financing schemes and the development of new ones, and an injection of new global liquidity through the creation of “a central international reserve currency, the value of which cannot be decisively influenced by one country alone, such as the United States”<sup id="fnref1:29"><a href="#fn:29" class="footnote-ref">29</a></sup>. The governance of such a new system would require what was termed “A Third World Secretariat”<sup id="fnref1:30"><a href="#fn:30" class="footnote-ref">30</a></sup>, implicitly based on an alliance between social democratic and democratic socialist countries, the Global South, the European Community, the COMECON countries, and the UN agencies, against monetarist orthodoxies, although the precise parameters of this were not spelt out.</p>
<p>Whether or not the proposals represented a “tamer” version of the NIEO is rather a moot point, not least because, as Fulla notes, the report “failed to elicit the interest of Western Europe’s socialist elites”<sup id="fnref1:31"><a href="#fn:31" class="footnote-ref">31</a></sup>, revealing both the continued Eurocentrism of much of the SI’s membership as well as divisions between socialist orientations and more social democratic reformist tendencies, already moving towards “Third Way” type accommodations to neoliberalism. Manley himself, upon re-election as Prime Minister in 1989, fully embraced neoliberalism, leaving his long-standing friend Julius Nyerere as the torch bearer for Southern socialism albeit within the South Commission and no longer in office.</p>
<h2><em>The Challenge to the South</em>: “collective self-reliance” in neoliberal order?</h2>
<p>The origins of the South Commission lie in the frustration felt by many leaders in the Global South at the failure of a series of reports and initiatives to break the impasse in North-South relations. In the words of Branislav Gosović: “it was felt that there was a need for in-depth reflection and dialogue by an independent commission of personalities only from the South, who would broadly agree on key challenges faced by developing countries and share their common objectives”<sup id="fnref1:32"><a href="#fn:32" class="footnote-ref">32</a></sup>. The initiative was spearheaded by the Prime Minister of Malaysia Mahathir Bin Mohamad and, although announced at the VIII NAM summit in Harare in September 1986, it appears to have had only a lukewarm reception, with the Economic Declaration stating only that the proposed Advisory Group of Eminent Persons “requires further study”<sup id="fnref1:33"><a href="#fn:33" class="footnote-ref">33</a></sup>. Mahathir Bin Mohamad then flew to Dar es Salaam to convince the former Tanzanian President Julius K. Nyerere to assume the chairmanship of the Commission. According to Vijay Prashad, Nyerere “was initially not keen on the idea”<sup id="fnref1:34"><a href="#fn:34" class="footnote-ref">34</a></sup> but undertook to gauge interest in the idea and to recruit potential commission members. Eventually, Nyerere, known across the Global South as Mwalimu meaning “teacher”, accepted to take on the role and the South Commission began its work in October 1987. Nyerere had left office in 1984 after fighting a losing battle for his version of African socialism in Tanzania with the IMF<sup id="fnref1:35"><a href="#fn:35" class="footnote-ref">35</a></sup>. Along with Nyerere and the Indian economist Manmohan Singh, the Commission was made up of twenty-seven members, dominated by what Prashad has termed “establishment figures” such as Commonwealth Secretary-General Sonny Ramphal, the Kuwaiti Adlatif al-Hammad, both veterans of the Brandt Commission and strongly opposed to more “radical” tendencies and in favour of a greater role for markets and the private sector, and Gamani Corea the Sri Lankan who had been Secretary General of UNCTAD between 1974 and 1984<sup id="fnref1:36"><a href="#fn:36" class="footnote-ref">36</a></sup>. There was “a small minority” of Commission members consisting of “those engaged with society and the political spaces in the South” from a more activist, grassroots, perspective, including Devaki Jain, one of only three women. She described the final report as an “anaemic development report, untethered to any political economy framework” offering a “sanitised” approach in contrast to Nyerere’s own “personality and politics”<sup id="fnref1:37"><a href="#fn:37" class="footnote-ref">37</a></sup> and the reverence he commanded in much of the Global South.</p>
<p>In many ways, then, the final report may be of less interest than the deliberations and alternative perspectives that were played out in background reports for and meetings of the Commission, despite Jain’s judgement that “no great exchange of new ideas and knowledge took place”<sup id="fnref1:38"><a href="#fn:38" class="footnote-ref">38</a></sup>. Indeed, Prashad frames the report, using Jain’s terms, as representing a victory for “the hawks”, emphasising the importance of export-driven economic growth, rapid industrialization and free markets, over “the doves” who favoured “people-centred development”, popular participation and “the voices and activity of the grassroots”<sup id="fnref1:39"><a href="#fn:39" class="footnote-ref">39</a></sup>. He is surely correct that the Commission focused a great deal of its attention on what he terms “the two main disasters” of the 1980s – “the debt crisis and the threat of the new international property regime”<sup id="fnref1:40"><a href="#fn:40" class="footnote-ref">40</a></sup>.</p>
<p>In terms of debt, he notes the watering down of an unusually radical analysis carried out for the Commission by Chandra Hardy from the World Bank which, essentially, blamed Northern banks for a situation in which much of the Global South “had to cut away at the basic livelihoods of their populations to pay the interest on the debt, and to abdicate any hope of growth towards development”<sup id="fnref1:41"><a href="#fn:41" class="footnote-ref">41</a></sup>. The report notes that debt repayments in the five years from 1984 to 1988 resulted in a net loss to the South of \$163 billion<sup id="fnref1:42"><a href="#fn:42" class="footnote-ref">42</a></sup>. Hardy’s raft of policy proposals echoed those of the Socialist International report, a mix of full debt cancellation, lengthening repayment periods, rescheduling, diverting development assistance from debt-servicing and greater allocation of standard drawing rights as a form of debt substitution. Ideas of a “debtors’ forum”, in line with the broader thrust of the report on the importance of South-South cooperation, was considered by the hawks as “unfeasible” and, whilst debt cancellation in Africa was possible, in Latin America and Asia the solution was a bargain in which “the banks would get some of their money back, and the South would be able to move to a growth agenda”<sup id="fnref1:43"><a href="#fn:43" class="footnote-ref">43</a></sup>. However, as forcefully argued by Manmohan Singh, Nyerere’s mantra of “growth with equity” would require “structural reforms” and a degree of austerity<sup id="fnref1:44"><a href="#fn:44" class="footnote-ref">44</a></sup>. Whilst critical of the conditionalities of the IMF “based on a doctrinaire belief in the efficacy of market forces”, a summary of the report suggested that the need for economic reforms in order to recover a growth momentum were “not in dispute” and that “such changes must involve a measure of belt tightening and discomfort”<sup id="fnref1:45"><a href="#fn:45" class="footnote-ref">45</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The South Commission report saw “the widening gap in overall development and wealth” between the North and the South as “to a large extent the science and technology gap”<sup id="fnref1:46"><a href="#fn:46" class="footnote-ref">46</a></sup>. Indeed, as Prashad notes, the Commission was frustrated with the extension of trade protectionism to the realms of services and intellectual property. However, the final report was careful not to be seen as overtly critical of OECD countries and, instead, placed the focus on what the South could do in terms of its educational systems, the integration of science and technology in national planning, and use of new technologies such as telecommunications and informatics to improve the South’s competitiveness in the world market. As Prashad reminds us, the South held around 1% of internationally recognised patents at the time<sup id="fnref1:47"><a href="#fn:47" class="footnote-ref">47</a></sup>. Criticism of “the present world intellectual property system – of patents, trademarks and copyrights”<sup id="fnref1:48"><a href="#fn:48" class="footnote-ref">48</a></sup> because it gave the North an unfair, even monopolistic, advantage in the South were rejected by neoliberals who suggested that “massive research and development expenditures by Northern private sectors” would only continue if there remained a reasonable expectation of returns on these investments<sup id="fnref1:49"><a href="#fn:49" class="footnote-ref">49</a></sup>. Insightfully, in its second meeting, however, the Commission noted the hypocrisy of global arrangements maintaining free movement of technology and labour from the North whilst allowing national laws to control immigration from the South<sup id="fnref1:50"><a href="#fn:50" class="footnote-ref">50</a></sup>.</p>
<p>At times, Nyerere’s insistence on avoiding ideological purity and ensuring the report reflected a wide range of different viewpoints led, not merely, to compromises, but to an insistence on improbable, if not impossible, combinations, not least in the mantra of “high rates of growth”, albeit “with equity” and, at the same time, being “environmentally sound”<sup id="fnref1:51"><a href="#fn:51" class="footnote-ref">51</a></sup>. The majority, however, was clearly for “growth first” or, at the very least, a sense that seizing the possibilities for high rates of growth had to be the priority as only this would enable policy commitments to equity and ecological sustainability to be turned into reality, a perverse reiteration of neoliberal “trickle down” economics. A mix of land reforms to increase agricultural productivity and small-scale labour-intensive industrialization would, then, go hand in hand with a greater role for the private sector and, above all, a preference for multinationals of the South over those of the North. Underpinned by “the fact that the ecological stress on the global commons has in large part been caused by the North” the report called for “large-scale investments” into “environment-sensitive development” that “the South can hardly make unaided”<sup id="fnref1:52"><a href="#fn:52" class="footnote-ref">52</a></sup>. The pro-business orientation of the report was clear, praising Southern multinationals for their “impressive financial, technological and managerial capabilities”, urging more joint ventures and for the G77 and NAM to “set up a standing committee to review co-operation in business and industry and suggest measures for its enlargement”<sup id="fnref1:53"><a href="#fn:53" class="footnote-ref">53</a></sup>.</p>
<p>In a nuanced assessment, Samir Amin suggests that there are traces in the report of a commitment to “selective delinking” from capitalist globalization and a renewed push for “South-South cooperation”. In terms reminiscent of his critique of the NIEO, whilst stating that “the industrialization of the periphery does not put an end to capitalist polarization”, it does move the centre of gravity towards the South in terms of technology, finance, media, and armaments<sup id="fnref1:54"><a href="#fn:54" class="footnote-ref">54</a></sup>. Ultimately, the South Commission appear torn between support for “the subordinate modernization of the peripheries”<sup id="fnref1:55"><a href="#fn:55" class="footnote-ref">55</a></sup> and true delinking. Immanuel Wallerstein, pointed out that “The Programme of Immediate Action” in the report not only “could have been written 20 years ago” but actually was<sup id="fnref1:56"><a href="#fn:56" class="footnote-ref">56</a></sup>. Denouncing the Report as “apolitical”, he suggested it missed so many of the key issues that are likely to emerge in a world that has gone beyond “developmentalist” paradigms: North-North divisions; the ex-East as the new South; South-South wars; South to North migration; and the prospect of North-South wars. Again, his critique of the structural assumptions of the Report echo those of the NIEO and beyond:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“An appeal of the liberals among the powerful to their compeers to make reforms in the interest of equity, justice, and heading off worse has never had any significant effect in the past several hundred years except in the wake of direct and violent rumblings by the oppressed, and it will have no more effect now.”<sup id="fnref1:57"><a href="#fn:57" class="footnote-ref">57</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The gendered dimensions of development, just as the cultural and environmental dimensions, are given just three pages in a report that ran to almost three hundred pages. The section on gender, described by Devaki Jain as “abysmal”<sup id="fnref1:58"><a href="#fn:58" class="footnote-ref">58</a></sup>, was included despite objections from some male members of the Commission. Ultimately, it reproduces a view that recognizing “the social and economic contribution of women” would allow the optimization of a “vital human resource”<sup id="fnref1:59"><a href="#fn:59" class="footnote-ref">59</a></sup>, with a tokenistic recognition of the damage done by structural adjustment largely sidelined against an overwhelming focus on changing “traditional” attitudes and practices and the need to foster a “gender-sensitive culture”<sup id="fnref1:60"><a href="#fn:60" class="footnote-ref">60</a></sup>.</p>
<p>One of the recommendations in the report, building on the 1989 NAM Belgrade summit decision to set up a Summit-Level Group for South-South Consultation and Co-Operation, was to establish a multi-stakeholder forum for South-South co-operation prioritising “the business community, the professions, women’s organizations, trade unions, and other social groups” alongside politicians and policy makers<sup id="fnref1:61"><a href="#fn:61" class="footnote-ref">61</a></sup>. The report also notes the difficulties some countries face in negotiating with the IMF and World Bank and recommended that the Group of 24 should set up a standing group of experienced advisors that developing countries could call upon in these negotiations, coordinated by UNDP<sup id="fnref1:62"><a href="#fn:62" class="footnote-ref">62</a></sup>. There were also calls for a Bank of the South, deliberately scaled down from earlier attempts and, initially at least, limited to providing finance “for exports and for clearing and payment arrangements”<sup id="fnref1:63"><a href="#fn:63" class="footnote-ref">63</a></sup>. Ultimately, the preference was for establishing a South Secretariat as “an intellectual powerhouse for the South’s collective advance”<sup id="fnref1:64"><a href="#fn:64" class="footnote-ref">64</a></sup>. In the South Commission’s final meeting, in October 1990, the South Centre was established, initially on a temporary basis, becoming an intergovernmental body akin to the idea of the Secretariat, in 1995, largely with the support of Indonesia as then chair of the NAM<sup id="fnref1:65"><a href="#fn:65" class="footnote-ref">65</a></sup>. Whilst more a kind of “think tank” in a rather crowded pool of similar institutions, the South Centre still exists but, as Gosović suggests, Nyerere’s illness and death in October 1999 meant that the Centre lost “his grand vision, unchallenged authority, global influence and reputation”<sup id="fnref1:66"><a href="#fn:66" class="footnote-ref">66</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The South Commission did not refer to the NIEO directly in its report. At the same time, as Nyerere made clear in a speech launching the report at an ECOSOC meeting in July 1991, it maintained the NIEO’s mantra of both national and collective self-reliance, refitting it for neoliberal purposes, calling for expanded South-South trade in the context of the power of the emerging multinationals of the South and the possibilities of harnessing possibilities of new technology as if technology was a neutral tool<sup id="fnref1:67"><a href="#fn:67" class="footnote-ref">67</a></sup>. As Prashad concludes, championing South-South co-operation had become less of a call for deep democratic participation, as Nyerere and Jain had advocated, and more aligning state policies with “export-oriented development strategies” in the service of “the Great Commodity Chain”<sup id="fnref1:68"><a href="#fn:68" class="footnote-ref">68</a></sup>. The response in the North to the report was to either criticise it or ignore it, overshadowed as it was by Iraq’s invasion of Kuwait in August 1990 and the ensuing reconfiguration of global hegemony that ensued.</p>

<p>A recent programmatic statement of what a new NIEO might look like is contained in “A Plan to Save the Planet”, produced under the leadership of ALBA-TCP. The Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our Americas (ALBA) was formed in 2004 on the initiative of Cuba and Venezuela. Bolivia joined in 2006, and the subsequent Peoples’ Trade Agreement (TCP) saw a number of other Latin American and Caribbean nations joining, mostly socialist in orientation. Ten member states and two guests met at the 24^th^ summit in Caracas, Venezuela on 14 December 2024 to celebrate the 20^th^ anniversary of ALBA. Paragraph 7 of the summit declaration reaffirms the movement’s conviction “to build foreign policies to prioritize depatriarchalization, climate justice and decolonization” and Paragraph 16 refers to the movement’s aspirations “for the fall of imperialism and the emergence of a new multipolar order, based on respectful relations and cooperation for the economic, political and social development of the peoples of the entire world”. At the same time, the declaration applauds the role of BRICS and the entry of some ALBA states into the BRICS+<sup id="fnref1:69"><a href="#fn:69" class="footnote-ref">69</a></sup>. ALBA, as noted in Chapter 6, has been an important, if declining, champion of a progressive economic, social and political regionalism, with recent initiatives including a common regional trading currency, a banking initiative, the creation of regional energy firms, and the establishment of a TV network <em>TeleSur</em> to democratise media portrayals of and in the region. In many ways, then, ALBA-TCP’s work clearly follows on from initiatives within, and related to, the NIEO.</p>
<p>In a Plan to Save the Planet, ALBA-TCP worked directly with two research institutes: the Simón Bolívar Institute for Peace and Solidarity Among Peoples and the Tricontinental: Institute for Social Research, who coordinated the work of a loose network of, in total, some 26 radical research institutes. The Simón Bolívar Institute was founded in September 2020 with the aim of promoting “global solidarity with the Bolivarian Revolution and the Venezuelan people, and the solidarity of the South American nation toward struggles for social and economic justice of peoples throughout the world<sup id="fnref1:70"><a href="#fn:70" class="footnote-ref">70</a></sup>”. The Tricontinental Institute, formed in 2015, led by Vijay Prashad, explicitly seeks “to build a bridge between academic production and political and social movements in order to promote critical thinking and stimulate debates and research with an emancipatory perspective that serves the people’s aspirations” seeking “to reclaim our histories of socialism and national liberation”<sup id="fnref1:71"><a href="#fn:71" class="footnote-ref">71</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The Plan is reproduced in a January 2022 dossier from the Tricontinental Institute entitled “We Will Build the Future”<sup id="fnref1:72"><a href="#fn:72" class="footnote-ref">72</a></sup>. Crucially, the preamble explicitly distinguishes The Plan from various, uncited, documents that call for a more inclusive capitalism, stating that “we do not believe that capitalism is a system that can benefit humankind”<sup id="fnref1:73"><a href="#fn:73" class="footnote-ref">73</a></sup>. Despite being published during the “coronavirus crisis”, it seeks to go beyond the immediate to address crisis in general and the need to build “a system designed around the needs of the working class and the peasantry and the requirements of a sustainable natural world”<sup id="fnref1:74"><a href="#fn:74" class="footnote-ref">74</a></sup>. The crisis is further defined in the preamble as three-fold: a general crisis of capitalism with its pursuit of profit leading to booms and slumps, and new forms of exploitation; the conjunctural crisis of neoliberalism leading to austerity; and the specific crisis induced by the financial collapse of 2007-8, “deeply rooted in the structure of financialisation and of the global value chain system” driving investment to non-productive sectors and concentrating jobs in “areas of the world where wages are held indecently low by the pressures of imperialism”<sup id="fnref1:75"><a href="#fn:75" class="footnote-ref">75</a></sup>. There is recognition of the centrality of the climate crisis but, also, caution regarding opportunistic use of this by “sectors of the capitalist class” whose attempts to modernise capitalism involve driving “public funds into private hands”<sup id="fnref1:76"><a href="#fn:76" class="footnote-ref">76</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Estimating that debt had reached 331% of GDP by 2020, the focus is also on the increasing precariatisation of labour through labour market reforms, removal of labour protections and the rise of the uber economy. The preamble notes that while the mainstream literature understands rising inequality as a threat to social stability, as economic activity becomes divorced from democratic institutions, the danger is that this quickly morphs into a discourse of “blaming China”. Prashad’s ambivalent stance in relation to BRICS here gives way to fulsome praise of China for having eradicated extreme poverty at home and engaging positively with the Third World through massive investments, primarily through the Belt and Road Initiative, offering a real alternative “to the IMF-driven development agenda”<sup id="fnref1:77"><a href="#fn:77" class="footnote-ref">77</a></sup>. The Plan is meant to contribute “to the ongoing battle of ideas that is a key part of the global class struggle”<sup id="fnref1:78"><a href="#fn:78" class="footnote-ref">78</a></sup> seeking to create subjective conditions for the intensification of that struggle.</p>
<p>The ALBA-TCP Introduction, written by Prashad and Carlos Ron, Venezuela’s Deputy Foreign Minister and President of the Simón Bolívar Institute, traces the Plan to the NIEO, whose principles remain valid to the present day, and the work of the South Commission “whose final document was not given the serious attention that it needed”<sup id="fnref1:79"><a href="#fn:79" class="footnote-ref">79</a></sup>. The emphasis is on the provisional nature of the document, “the first of many drafts to come” with an aspiration to “eventually advance … toward a resolution to save the planet”<sup id="fnref1:80"><a href="#fn:80" class="footnote-ref">80</a></sup> at the United Nations.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the elaboration in the two introductions from ALBA and the Tricontinental Institute, the overall proposal seems lacking in detail, perhaps inevitable given the sheer breadth of themes discussed. The Plan starts from the interlocking apartheids of money, medicine and food, linking these to control over science and technology, finance, resources, weapons, and communications by a small group of corporations and governments. There is a focus on debt and the staggering costs of debt servicing, with 64 countries spending more on this than on health care in 2020<sup id="fnref1:81"><a href="#fn:81" class="footnote-ref">81</a></sup>. The call is for external debt to be cancelled, not least as it is “a consequence of a long history of colonial theft, imperialist exploitation, and plunder” <sup id="fnref1:82"><a href="#fn:82" class="footnote-ref">82</a></sup>. In any case, the plan continues, an estimated \$37 trillion in “illicit tax havens” could also be used to cancel debts in the Global South. Medical apartheid relates, specifically, to the COVID-19 crisis, and concerns vaccine nationalism and vaccine hoarding. Food apartheid notes the increasing numbers of people without access to adequate food supplies, totaling 2.37 billion in 2020<sup id="fnref1:83"><a href="#fn:83" class="footnote-ref">83</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Echoing, but going beyond, the holistic approach of the NIEO, the report is organized around 12 key themes: democracy and the world order; the environment; finance; health; housing; food; education; work; care; women and LGBTQ+ people; culture; and the digital world. As a provisional document, there is an acknowledgement that this is only the beginning but, of course, the questions of by whom and how its calls will be taken up are left unanswered. The ten demands around democracy and the world order are something of a reiteration of many of the core demands of the early NAM, including adherence to the UN Charter, strengthening the UNGA over the Security Council, reducing spending on arms and using funds saved for “socially beneficial production”. It also seeks to ensure rights beyond mere citizenship to all marginalized peoples including “women, indigenous peoples, people of colour, migrants, undocumented people, people with disabilities, LGBTQ+ people, oppressed castes, and the impoverished”<sup id="fnref1:84"><a href="#fn:84" class="footnote-ref">84</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The section on the environment is framed in terms of the idea of “common but differentiated responsibilities” placing the onus, in terms of cutting carbon emissions, on the developed world, and seeking “climate compensation” for the developing world, as well as a rather unspecific “robust funding” of “public infrastructure to replace reliance upon carbon-based energy”<sup id="fnref1:85"><a href="#fn:85" class="footnote-ref">85</a></sup>. A similarly vague call is made in terms of the importance of “a transition programme towards a paradigm capable of mitigating and adapting carbon-based energy systems”<sup id="fnref1:86"><a href="#fn:86" class="footnote-ref">86</a></sup>, failing to note how “mitigation and adaptation” have now become rather mainstream, and somewhat technocratic, ideas. The section on finance reiterates ideas of debt cancelation and calls for a unitary global taxation system “to tax the share of global profits generated by subsidiaries of multinational corporations”<sup id="fnref1:87"><a href="#fn:87" class="footnote-ref">87</a></sup>. Another vague proposal is on creating “people-based alternatives to IMF and World Bank-led finance for development programmes”<sup id="fnref1:88"><a href="#fn:88" class="footnote-ref">88</a></sup>, with no examples provided and a lack of clarity as to whether Chinese or BRICS development funding, praised in the Tricontinental Institute preamble, should really be considered as “people-based”. Even the demand for “public sector pension funds” in the face of privatization remains vague, not least in the context of the expansion of marketized new public management into public sectors around the world.</p>
<p>The section on health has a focus on decommodification and public provision, with a recommendation to form a “United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Health Threats”<sup id="fnref1:89"><a href="#fn:89" class="footnote-ref">89</a></sup>, with no sense of the mandate or reach of such a body nor how this would differ from what the World Health Organization already does. Calling for a health tax on large corporations that produce food and beverages that are harmful could easily have been proposed within a liberal, “inclusive capitalism”, frame. Whilst welcome, the section on housing does not really respond to the variegated housing crisis across the Global South. Linkages to public transportation and to climate mitigation, including requiring “all buildings above 2,000 metres to have green roofs or solar panels”<sup id="fnref1:90"><a href="#fn:90" class="footnote-ref">90</a></sup>, whilst interesting, could well be containable within “green capitalism” notwithstanding the lack of any indication of how funding would be ensured. The section on food includes the prevention of developed countries subsidizing their own agribusinesses and the importance of public, national and regional, food systems. There is a return to the first wave decolonial project of land redistribution and limitations on land ownership, combined with public irrigation systems as well as building robust public distribution systems to eliminate hunger. The call for the removal of patents on seeds and building legal frameworks “to protect native seeds against commodification by agribusiness” is, also, a theme that links to demands from the 1970s. Whilst calls for the decommodification of education are predictable, and other calls appear straight from a liberal playbook, the call to “establish management educational institutes that cater to the needs of cooperatives in industrial, agricultural, and service sectors”<sup id="fnref1:91"><a href="#fn:91" class="footnote-ref">91</a></sup> would, surely, have benefitted from some real world examples.</p>
<p>The sections on work, care, and women and LGBTQ+ people are of interest precisely because they fill gaps that were not addressed in the NIEO whilst also addressing contemporary phenomena such as the informal and gig economies. There is a strong emphasis on the importance of collective bargaining and of robust social protection schemes challenging both means-testing and workfare programmes. The importance of publicly-financed neighbourhood creches and after-school programmes is also stated. There is a recognition of the importance of unpaid domestic work and care work but no reference to global care chains. The last two sections on Culture and The Digital World continue themes developed within, although they make no reference to, the NWICO demands, striking a balance between support for what is termed “the traditional arts of the people” in danger of being commodified or distorted by an undefined “cruel cultural nationalism” and the need to build “a digital global commons”, “nationalize telecommunications infrastructure” and “promote and fund free hardware and software development”<sup id="fnref1:92"><a href="#fn:92" class="footnote-ref">92</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The failure to follow up and deepen elements of the plan is, perhaps, symptomatic of the “projectification”<sup id="fnref1:93"><a href="#fn:93" class="footnote-ref">93</a></sup> of the world of think tanks and research institutes, even those from the left and the Global South. It appears that both ALBA-TCP and the Tricontinental Institute continue to work on similar themes but in an ever more crowded playground of similar initiatives that gain fleeting attention and are then lost. The proposed linkage to the United Nations was, perhaps, never likely to materialize, suggesting that the changed conditions of intellectual production mitigate against such initiatives ever being more than words on paper. Whilst the explicit acknowledgement of the legacy of the NIEO and the South Commission is to be welcomed, tensions between liberal and anti-capitalist framings, public ownership and popular participation, and the balance between the role of global governance, regional power blocs, and nation states, remain unresolved. ALBA-TCP’s own ”Strategic Agenda 2030”<sup id="fnref1:94"><a href="#fn:94" class="footnote-ref">94</a></sup> is, perhaps, albeit on a smaller transnational-sub-regional scale, a more detailed and relevant document setting out the economic, social, political and cultural-communication dimensions of a more holistic response to neoliberal policies, based on meaningful collaboration on trade, finance, energy, environment, health, and education.</p>
<h2>Enter The Progressive International: The Newest New NIEO?</h2>
<p>As Sam Nicholls has argued, one of the most important and most recent attempts to use the “strategic imaginaries”<sup id="fnref1:95"><a href="#fn:95" class="footnote-ref">95</a></sup> of the original NIEO has been developed by the Progressive International (PI), a global network formally launched in May 2020 “with a mission to unite, organize and mobilize the world’s progressive forces”<sup id="fnref1:96"><a href="#fn:96" class="footnote-ref">96</a></sup>. The origins of the PI can be traced back to September 2018 when former Greek Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis, having focused up to that point exclusively on Europe through the DIEM25 (Democracy in Europe Movement 25) founded in 2016, called for a new internationalist movement. He was joined, soon after, by the left-wing US Senator Bernie Sanders and his Sanders Institute. Varoufakis and future PI General Co-Ordinator David Adler explicitly juxtaposed the PI with a growing “Nationalist International” naming Orban, Bolsonaro, Duterte and Trump as a coalition “cracking down on civil rights, scapegoating minorities and facilitating widespread corruption”<sup id="fnref1:97"><a href="#fn:97" class="footnote-ref">97</a></sup>. In a rather clumsy historical overview, the authors argued that the collapse of the Bretton Woods system led to key international institutions, including the IMF, the World Bank, and the ILO turning against “the very principles on which they were founded”, faithfully delivering “the Davos world order, serving the interests of the financial elite against those of the countries they were designed to represent”<sup id="fnref1:98"><a href="#fn:98" class="footnote-ref">98</a></sup>. At the time, rather than referencing the NIEO, the focus was on A Green New Deal for the 21^st^ Century, combining the power of the IMF and World Bank, a ”reinvigorated United Nations”, and new institutions such as a Tax Justice Authority “to eliminate tax evasion”<sup id="fnref1:99"><a href="#fn:99" class="footnote-ref">99</a></sup>.</p>
<p>On 8 December 2022, at the People’s Forum, New York, the PI hosted an international conference launching a process of deliberation for a new NIEO. In the words of Layan Fuleihan, Education Director of the People’s Forum, the aim was “to build an alternative to the unipolar US dominated global system” and to challenge “global capitalism and US imperialism”<sup id="fnref1:100"><a href="#fn:100" class="footnote-ref">100</a></sup>. At the same time, the PI has now compiled an extremely important set of new reflections on the NIEO and its continued relevance, perhaps the most comprehensive contemporary intellectual resource available. Some 25 original texts have been published, with another 8 referred to as “coming soon”<sup id="fnref1:101"><a href="#fn:101" class="footnote-ref">101</a></sup>, alongside the Declaration itself and interventions by politicians, activists and others, dated between 1972 (Salvador Allende) and 2011 (Evo Morales and The People’s Agreement of Cochabamba). The relevance of the principles of the NIEO to what is described as “today’s polycrisis” is framed in terms of food, sovereign debt, foreign extraction of natural resources, concentration of technology and intellectual property<sup id="fnref1:102"><a href="#fn:102" class="footnote-ref">102</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The strength of the collection lies in its eclecticism, in disagreements about the meanings of the NIEO, its contemporary relevance, and perhaps, above all, in combining breadth of concerns with a depth of analysis missing from “A Plan to Save the Planet”. The original NIEO is, variously, understood as “economically rational”<sup id="fnref1:103"><a href="#fn:103" class="footnote-ref">103</a></sup>, “noble” but “deeply limited”<sup id="fnref1:104"><a href="#fn:104" class="footnote-ref">104</a></sup>, and “radical” if “paradoxical” in terms of a new anti-colonial sovereign power that was “seeking inclusion in a world order they wanted to transform”<sup id="fnref1:105"><a href="#fn:105" class="footnote-ref">105</a></sup>. More critically, the texts demonstrate little or no understanding of the significance of gender relations, care, or social protection nor, indeed, of migration although, intriguingly, Schwartz traces the collapse of post-WWII macroeconomic planning to the rebellion of “semi-skilled male labor”, women’s entry into the formal labour market, and the refusal of producers in the developing world, especially oil-producers, to continue to supply cheap raw materials<sup id="fnref1:106"><a href="#fn:106" class="footnote-ref">106</a></sup>. There is a great deal of focus on questions of ecological justice and planetary boundaries with Davies, for example, reinforcing calls for a Global Green New Deal emanating from UNCTAD in terms of “common but differentiated responsibilities” and protection of “the global commons”<sup id="fnref1:107"><a href="#fn:107" class="footnote-ref">107</a></sup>. Revisiting issues around the Law of the Sea, Guy Standing presents a persuasive argument on the importance of the defence of “the blue commons” and “the blue economy” in terms of preserving maritime and shoreline ecosystems. His proposal regarding a Blue Commons Fund, comprised of levies on carbon emissions, port use, bunker fuels, cruise liners, seabed use, noise, industrial acquaculture and non-targeted fishing or bycatch, combines the practical and the visionary very much in the spirit of the original NIEO.</p>
<p>A number of texts explicitly refer to the radically different nature of the current conjuncture to the conditions of the 1970s, warning against resuscitating “yesterday’s Keynesian tools” and green new deals<sup id="fnref1:108"><a href="#fn:108" class="footnote-ref">108</a></sup>. There are explicit calls for the rejection of hyperfinancialization, for the decommodification of public goods and services, and for “a shared horizon of production of goods and services for use, with prices engineered to achieve a world-wide just distribution of these goods, social rights guaranteed, and political institutions created to allow for the human reproduction of ecology”<sup id="fnref1:109"><a href="#fn:109" class="footnote-ref">109</a></sup>. Articles negotiate a difficult path between radicalism and realism with no criticism, whatsoever, of China or the BRICS involving, at times, an over-optimistic reading of the New Development Bank and Belt and Road initiatives as a challenge to “the dominant institutions and ideas that emerged with hyperglobalization”<sup id="fnref1:110"><a href="#fn:110" class="footnote-ref">110</a></sup>. The <em>realpolitik</em> of a recognition of the strength of China and the G77, particularly in relation to global climate change negotiations<sup id="fnref1:111"><a href="#fn:111" class="footnote-ref">111</a></sup>, is paired with uncritical praise, from the President of the Academy of Marxism of the Chinese Academy of Science, for China’s commitment to building “commmunity with a shared future for humanity”, UN reform, regional cooperation, and peaceful development as components of a “principled and rationally organised” international economic order<sup id="fnref1:112"><a href="#fn:112" class="footnote-ref">112</a></sup>.</p>
<p>One of the most interesting texts, opening up a theme to which I return in the Concluding chapter, is Nesiah’s explicit linkage between the NIEO, the Palestinian question, and the expulsion from the UN of apartheid South Africa, in terms of racial capitalism and racist governance. The backlash against the NIEO, then, was precisely a reassertion of what Achille Mbembe has termed an “anti-third world Eurocentrism”<sup id="fnref1:113"><a href="#fn:113" class="footnote-ref">113</a></sup>. Seeing the NIEO as an attempt at “radical redistribution” of both material resources and social capital challenging the existing “racial ordering of the world”, allows Nasiah to explicitly link the NIEO with mutual aid networks, economic co-operatives, and “calls for reparations for the slave trade and colonialism that resist and unsettle the regime of trade and aid that shape economic precarity and climate injustice today”, speaking to “the historical conjuncture of the current moment”<sup id="fnref1:114"><a href="#fn:114" class="footnote-ref">114</a></sup>. A new NIEO, Patel suggests, “will look different” precisely because “the political architecture of liberation and solidarity, of reparation and reconstruction are different now from the 1970s”<sup id="fnref1:115"><a href="#fn:115" class="footnote-ref">115</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The Programme of Action on the Construction of a New International Economic Order was first presented at the 5^th^ International Conference for World Equilibrium, sometimes termed the Conference for World Balance, in Havana, Cuba, in January 2023. The Conference, part of the Jose Marti Project for World Solidarity, gathered activists, policy makers, and scholars to address issues of global concern<sup id="fnref1:116"><a href="#fn:116" class="footnote-ref">116</a></sup>. The Havana Declaration, presented to the conference plenary, is framed clearly in terms of antagonistic interests, stating: “economic liberation will not be granted, but must be seized. Our vision can only be realized through the formation of new and alternative institutions to share critical technology, tackle sovereign debt, drive development finance, and face future pandemics together”<sup id="fnref1:117"><a href="#fn:117" class="footnote-ref">117</a></sup>. Reproducing the spirit of collective self-reliance underpinning the NIEO, the Programme emphasises “the shared institutions and coordinated actions that Southern governments can take collectively and unilaterally to transform the global economic architecture”. It also emphasises the importance of ending a “race to the bottom” and, instead, stimulating “a climb to the top”. It is divided into five thematic sections: Climate, Energy, and Natural Resources; Industry, Labor, and International Trade; Money, Debt, and Finance; Technology, Innovation, and Education; and Governance, Multilateralism, and International Law.</p>
<p>The section on climate emphasises the need for reparation based on a confrontation with “the system that bears responsibility for its breakdown”, with a view that “green transition” would just be a continuation of the colonial dynamics that caused the crisis in the first place. The call is for collective action by the South “to regain full and permanent sovereignty over land, food, and resources”. It traces the contours of a system of ecologically equal exchange and outlines a number of potential initiatives underpinned by a coordinated declaration of a climate emergency by the South to provide a window of opportunity for the actions needed. These include a shared policy framework for the management of extractive industries, although how to ensure that only “socially necessary extraction” occurs, much less how that might be defined, is not spelt out. The idea of regional pooling of energy capacity and resources to ensure fair distribution across the South is combined with that of Sellers’ Clubs for the production and sale of primary, agricultural and mineral resources to stabilise prices and improve the bargaining power of sellers, much as the actions of OPEC had done in relation to the original NIEO. Rescaling of agriculture through regional co-ordination of small scale and cooperative farms and an emphasis on networks of seed banks to promote agricultural resilience and food security are also suggested. Although sceptical of a green transition, there is a reiteration of the importance of a circular economy based on the recycling of waste from industry and mass consumption. Given its originality, it is unfortunate that Standing’s ideas around the Law of the Sea and a “blue commons” are not mentioned at all in the programme.</p>
<p>The section on trade follows the logic of the NIEO in terms of more equal terms of trade and the importance of fair and stable prices and, indeed, reintroduces ideas first mooted some fifty years ago, including maintaining a range of multilateral buffer stocks of essential commodities. Although greater South-South trade is important, the nature of a proposed quota system is not clearly set out. In addition, whilst campaigns to “buy Southern”, alongside Southern investment and production clubs, are unproblematic in themselves, it is not at all clear how these would, in and of themselves, transform a neoliberalism of the South into forms of industrialization and economic restructuring that improve the quality of life of the entire population. Coordination of key industries, state ownership, and the establishment of regional value chains are also suggested as if, in and of themselves, they would “advance a just green transition”. Transnational workers’ councils to ensure a regional minimum wage and labour standards across borders are also emphasised. Collective withdrawal from harmful trade and investment agreements as a precursor to alternative trading arrangements across the South is another proposal set out without reference as to why previous attempts at something similar failed.</p>
<p>The section on Debt suggests measures that would reconfigure international monetary and financial systems, combining the cancellation of untenable sovereign debts and the creation of an international taxation regime for multinationals. New Southern-based payment systems, currencies and, indeed, development banks are called for although there is no reference to whether these would differ significantly from the BRICS’ initiatives already in place or being planned. The idea of a new multilateral Southern credit rating agency, assessing programmes based on shared prosperity and sustainability not profitability is put forward as a way to blunt “the weaponization of creditworthiness” and create opportunities for “sovereign development on Southern terms”. Again, as above, it is unclear how proposed Debtors’ clubs would be any more successful in the future than they have been in the past or why today’s conditions differ from those in the past. In addition, whilst coordinated efforts to eliminate tax evasion and tax havens are praiseworthy, there is no reference to broader Southern or global taxation for development. The issue of remittances, ignored by the original NIEO but increasingly important as a theme for development agencies, is addressed although the details of how a new Southern multilateral body would be able “to facilitate the flow of remittances at little or no cost”, much less channel remittances for development purposes, remain unspecified.</p>
<p>In relation to technology, the programme continues the focus of the South Commission on intellectual property laws and emphasises the importance of “free transfers of emergent and critical technologies across borders”, standing in some contradiction, perhaps, to an emphasis on “technological sovereignty”. There is also an emphasis on building a Southern research infrastructure to compete with the Global North. Again, pooling of resources in terms of critical technologies as public goods is central, including the development of biotechnologies and digital infrastructure although, surprisingly, mass communications are not mentioned. One proposal that appears consistent with “neoliberalism with Southern characteristics” is the idea of a network of labour training institutes to train workers in healthcare, clean energy, agroecology, construction and other key industries, to prevent “brain drain”, one of the few references in the programme to migration. The proposals relating to governance reiterate many of the principles of the Non-Aligned Movement including respect for the UN Charter, and UN reform to ensure “equity of voice and vote”. Coordinated withdrawal from existing Investor-State Dispute Settlement systems is meant to lead to a binding treaty on multinational corporations. A clear lineage from NAM can be found in the advancing of a “global disarmament agenda”. The South is also urged to act as a bloc to temper Northern agendas in the IMF and other institutions. Finally, a Right to Development treaty, first muted at the NAM summit in Durban in 1998, should be passed.</p>
<p>The emphasis, throughout, then, is on collective demands, consensus building, and unity from the South as opposed to “asking for power” from the North. There are, inevitably, tensions between local, regional, Southern, and national scales with the sovereignty of nation states put forward as an unquestionable principle despite the myriad ways in which national self-interest of some of the more powerful states in the Global South represents one of the main stumbling blocks to that unity of purpose. Whilst the relative neglect of gender, care, migration and social rights is problematic, the programme is less abstract and more specific than that of the ALBA-Tricontinental Plan. It combines transformative, reformist and technical measures in innovative ways. Although the programme as it stands was only finalised in November 2024, so that future development is, by necessity, unclear, the biggest problem appears to be the lack of any clear pathway into global institutions such as the UN. The linkage that was originally proposed with the 2024 Cuban presidency of the G77 does not appear to have been as productive as it might have been, with the G77+China summit in Havana in September 2024 only attended by some 30 countries, indicative, perhaps, of the lack of unity across the Global South and the difficulties of replacing existing, BRICS+-led, <em>realpolitik</em> with the kind of moral authority that underpinned NAM in the 1970s and which, combined with the actions of OPEC, created the possibility for the original NIEO.</p>
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>This, albeit partial, overview of one initiative and two reports from the mid-1980s and early-1990s, and of two contemporary reports, serves to remind us that, despite changing conjunctural conditions, elements of the spirit of both the original NIEO and of the “golden age” of NAM, have not disappeared but have been reconfigured and reconstituted in interesting ways. As noted above, the tension between radicalism and reformism, the balance between different scales, and the difficulties of securing and maintaining a unity of purpose across the Global South, already tensions in the original NIEO, remained intractable in the period afterwards. Indeed, the capture of neoliberalism of parts of the Global South, and the development of a neoliberalism with Southern characteristics, was firmly entrenched up to the global financial crisis. Subsequently, despite pronouncements of a post neoliberal order, and a new multilateralism, the question of who and how to take forward a new NIEO remains unresolved and, perhaps for the foreseeable future, unresolvable. Even so, the intellectual work and detailing of policy options may not be completely in vain.</p>
