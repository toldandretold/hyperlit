Hi Sam

Good to see you on line last night.

Here is my feedback. 

I like the font. It is easy to read. 

On page two, I think we need to say Naarm/Melbourne. That way we educate those not familiar with the First Nations name, for example some international readers.

Let's also date it June 2025.

I think the contents page needs more work on the spacing. 

I suggest some extra space between each of the four parts.

We will also need to be consistent with how we use capitalisation. this was obviously not resolved with what I sent through. I tend to think upper case for start of a title and after a colon plus for proper nouns. But otherwise lower case. But Debbie should make the final decision on that one. She is chief proof reader for the FSO, so makes final decisions on things like that which have evolved over time.

On the contents page, I think there needs to be more spacing between where the text ends and the numbers. 

When we get to the articles, I like the way you have done the headlines. My one suggestion is that we change the dates to lower case. so, in the first article, for example, it would read October 2015.

n the question of images

On the question of images, the ones on line are of varied quality. I suggest we go for one image an caption at the start of each section. Maybe on the title page for the section. What do you both think?

With the text at the top of each page, I think it should be aligned left on the even pages and aligned right on the odd pages. I like the text you have suggested. It this competes with the page numbers, maybe they would look ok at the bottom of the page.

With the sub heads, I think that the bold works well. we could try getting rid of the return so that the text follows immediately on from the bold sub head. What do you both think?

If we retain the return, we needed to ensure sub heads are not stranded. See bottom of page 7 for an example. United we win! would need to be on page 8. 

In the second piece by Fraser and Hoddersen, we are only including a short extract. Delete the text before the sub head, Form a United Front Against Reaction

More coming.

With what I was saying about removing the return after the sub heads, see page 38 in Debbie's review for an example where it says: But what is fascism? I think this is how we should do the sub heads consistently through out. 

Page 40/41 delete: Freedom Socialist Party and Radical Women will jointly host a reading circle on this latter book, starting in October. Stay tuned!

Page 9 - delete: This document was originally published in the Freedom Socialist
newspaper in special supplements to Vol. 11, No. 3 (June 1989); Vol. 11,
No. 4 (February 1990); and Vol. 12, No. 2 (October 1990).

Page 55, sub head reads: US United Fronts to Fight Fascism  it will need to read: U.S. United Fronts to Fight Fascism

Throughout the book any reference to the United States needs to be U.S. as this is stylistically how we have been doing it for many years now. so we will need to just fix this for consistency in any early articles like this one from 1990.

****page 59 delete this reference given we haven't included it in the book: (see Linda Averill, “Winning West Coast Strategy: Knock out the Nazis with a United Front,” Freedom Socialist, Volume 14 #2, April – June 1993).****

Same article, page 61, also delete:  (for full analysis of this phenomenon, see Clara Fraser, “LaRouche: Sex Maniac and Demagogue” in Freedom Socialist , Volume 9 #3, 1986).

Page 80 delete: (See Melbourne coalition turns out to fight fascists.) 11:00 am

Actually, I probably don't need this level of detail I am starting to get into at this stage. 

My general feedback is that the font is great and easy to read.

Also, as I kept working through it having the page numbers at the top and the text that appears throughout at the top centralised grew on me. 

Thanks so much for your work on this Sam. If you both let me know what you think of the 1 photo for each part idea, we can then work on getting quality images and captions.
