But once such structures and such ideologies were in existence, they would perpetuate the control of the surplus by a certain group even when it no longer served the purpose of advancing production.

To a lesser extent, peasants also used markets to sell excess crops to get cash for salt or other basic items. But so long as they were able to till their own land and produce the necessities of survival, they were not dependent on the market to sell their produce or buy goods from others. Despite the increasing production of non-agricultural goods and their exchange over the course of many centuries, economies remained primarily agricultural. Commodity production of goods sold on a market still existed only in pockets of society. The majority of the population—still as much as 80 or 90 percent worldwide between 1400 and 1800—lived in the country, subsisted on the meager foods and goods of their own production, and couldn’t afford to buy the products of the town’s craftsmen.

The Iranians of the _Avesta_ and the Germans of the _Lex Saxonum_ also chose the ox as the universal equivalent, which indicates the predominance of cattle-raising in the epoch when this happened. In North, East, and South Africa, cattle, in the shape of camels, sheep, goats or cows, likewise constituted the universal equivalent among people who were essentially cattle-breeders,” Mandel, _Marxist Economic Theory_ , vol. 1, 74.",

The rate of surplus value is therefore an exact expression for the degree of exploitation of labor-power by capital, or the worker by the capitalist.” See Marx, _Capital_ , vol. 1, 326. However, in the simplified version of this same example, I said the ratio of surplus labor/necessary labor was 7/1. This is because here we didn’t account for the capitalists’ expenditure of constant capital.

American socialist Hal Draper had a very useful description of the working class as existing in concentric circles. An industrial “core” sits strategically at the center of capitalist production, while outer rings of workers are less likely to be direct producers, but nonetheless contribute to the collective process of the extraction of surplus value.

These estimates include some teachers, social workers, and other professions, which Zweig and Moody both classify as a mixed bag of some middle-class and some working-class jobs. These professions, Moody and Zweig argue, are proletarianizing professions. And this is particularly significant because, as Moody points out, many of these proletarianizing professionals are today leading some of the most militant class struggles in the US. My take is that teachers and nurses have not had enough autonomy or independence to be considered part of the middle class for a long time, and certainly not today in the days of “teaching to the test.” Even if a degree of flexibility within the classroom affords some creativity on the job, teachers have no control over any of the basic parameters of the job—size of the class and therefore workload, schedule, benefits, etc. I also think that greater sections of many other professions from accountants to web developers should be accounted for within the ranks of the working class. Many of these jobs entail routinized and tedious tasks, require long hours, and offer meager compensation. Lastly, though supervisors can generally be considered part of the middle class, there are many instances in which this is not the case. Many, if not most, of BLS-classified “first line supervisors” in retail and food prep/service jobs, for instance, are probably working class. These supervisors often have such “privileges” as coming up with shift schedules or opening or closing the store, but have no jurisdiction to hire and fire, or hold any other meaningful authority. Taking into consideration these variables, my own very rough analysis of data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics led me to estimate that these numbers could be as high as 75 percent.",

McGraw, “How Big Pharma Gave America Its Heroin Problem,” _Pacific Standard_ , November 30, 2015, for a discussion of Big Pharma’s relationship to heroin addictions. The World Health Organization itself has argued: “As a result of this pressure to maintain sales, there is now ‘an inherent conflict of interest between the legitimate business goals of manufacturers and the social, medical, and economic needs of providers and the public to select and use drugs in the most rational way.’ This is particularly true where drugs companies are the main source of information as to which products are most effective. Even in the United Kingdom, where the medical profession receives more independent, publicly-funded information than in many other countries, promotional spending by pharmaceuticals companies is fifty times greater than spending on public information on health.” See “Pharmaceutical Industry,” World Health Organization website, <a href=\"http://www.who.int/trade/glossary/story073/en/\">http://www.who.int/trade/glossary/story073/en/</a>.",

Further, as we’ll discuss in future chapters, investment in mortgage-related financial products helped to inflate prices even higher. When the bubble popped, millions couldn’t pay their mortgages and faced foreclosures, and families lost their homes. Capitalism’s solution is not to find ways to keep people in their houses (much less to house the homeless!) but to try and find ways to restore profitability to the banks and to the real estate industry. Rather than reining in banks and financial institutions, nothing was done to provide homeowner relief, or to make houses more affordable.",

Regarding Ricardo’s argument, Marx quotes him here: “Too much of a particular commodity may be produced, of which there may be such a glut in the market, as not to repay the capital expended on it; but this cannot be the case with respect to all commodities; the demand for corn is limited by the mouths which are to eat it, for shoes and coats by the persons who are to wear them; but though a community, or a part of a community, may have as much corn, and as many hats and shoes, as it is able or may wish to consume, the same _cannot be said of every commodity produced by nature or by art_. Some would consume more wine, if they had the ability to procure it. Others having enough of wine, would wish to increase the quantity or improve the quality of their furniture. Others might wish to ornament their grounds, or to enlarge their houses. The wish to do all or some of these is implanted in every man’s breast; _nothing is required but the means, and nothing can afford the means, but an increase of production._ ” Marx replies, in part: “What is the purpose of all this? In periods of over-production, a large part of the nation (especially the working class) is less well provided than ever with corn, shoes etc., not to speak of wine and furniture. If over-production could only occur when all the members of a nation had satisfied even their most urgent needs, there could never, in the history of bourgeois society up to now, have been a state of general over-production or even of partial over-production. When, for instance, the market is glutted by shoes or calicoes or wines or colonial products, does this perhaps mean that four-sixths of the nation have more than satisfied their needs in shoes, calicoes, etc.? What after all has over-production to do with absolute needs? It is only concerned with demand that is backed by ability to pay. It is not a question of absolute over-production—over-production as such in relation to the absolute need or the desire to possess commodities. In this sense there is neither partial nor general over-production; and the one is not opposed to the other.”",

There’s clearly a relationship between the technical and organic compositions of capital, but you can see how they might change at different rates. Marx wrote: “By the composition of capital we mean… the ratio between its active and its passive component, between variable and constant capital. Two relationships are involved here… The first relationship depends on technical conditions and is to be taken as given, at any particular stage of development of productivity… A definite number of workers corresponds to a definite quantity of means of production… The _organic_ composition of capital is the name we give to its value composition, insofar as this is determined by its technical composition and reflects it.” Marx, _Capital_ , vol. 3, 244–245.",

After the dot-com bubble burst, the Federal Reserve responded with lowering interest rates from 6.5% to 1% between 2001 and 2003 in order to jump-start the economy. This gave banks easy credit to extend mortgages and other loans. At the same time, investors increasingly looked to mortgage-backed securities for a higher return than the 1% offered by Federal Reserve. Both of these trends fed into the creation of a housing bubble. Meanwhile, more investors took money out of the stock market after the crash and invested in real estate. As Yale economist Robert Shiller argued: “Once stocks fell, real estate became the primary outlet for the speculative frenzy that the stock market had unleashed.” See Jonathan R. Laing, “The Bubble’s New Home,” _Barron’s_ , June 20, 2005.",
