<p>"The development of professional traders transformed the goal of exchange from the procurement of like items for use to the accumulation of money. The equation thus changed from C-M-C to M-C-M; or more accurately M-C-M’. The doohickey above the M (“M prime,” technically speaking) represents _more_ money, or an increase of value above and beyond the money initially invested. In pre-capitalist societies, the basis for this added wealth was, more often than not, pilfering loot. Merchants from more economically developed centers were able to take advantage of societies that did not rely on large-scale internal trade. They could thus purchase goods on the cheap, and then sell them at a higher price in places where these goods were scarce and their values unknown."</p>
