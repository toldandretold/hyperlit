How many more customers could Starbucks possibly hope to attract with three identical caf\u00e9s facing each other on the same street? But after Starbucks bought out the competition of the smaller independent coffee shops, they eventually sold off that property to other investors. Starbucks would rather lose money on a redundant store than have people walking around town holding cups that advertise another coffee shop."

                    "Of course, sometimes certain industries are allowed to limp along through state intervention, extending and exacerbating the overaccumulation of capital by not letting inefficient companies go bust. Consider the case of steel, which has experienced a colossal level of overcapacity for at least a decade since the Great Recession. Globally, the industry produces 35 percent more steel than can find effective demand. Yet production has not \u201cadjusted\u201d accordingly. The popular, politically opportunistic (and often laden with nationalist, racist rhetoric) explanation is to blame China. But it is capitalism\u2019s own inherent tendencies (only most successful in China at present), which have led to this phenomenal global glut. A Duke University report, sponsored by American steel manufacturers and titled \u201cOvercapacity in Steel: China\u2019s Role in a Global Problem,\u201d unwittingly makes this point. It\u2019s worth quoting at length:"

Some would consume more wine, if they had the ability to procure it. Others having enough of wine, would wish to increase the quantity or improve the quality of their furniture. Others might wish to ornament their grounds, or to enlarge their houses. The wish to do all or some of these is implanted in every man\u2019s breast; _nothing is required but the means, and nothing can afford the means, but an increase of production._ \u201d Marx replies, in part: \u201cWhat is the purpose of all this? In periods of over-production, a large part of the nation (especially the working class) is less well provided than ever with corn, shoes etc., not to speak of wine and furniture. If over-production could only occur when all the members of a nation had satisfied even their most urgent needs, there could never, in the history of bourgeois society up to now, have been a state of general over-production or even of partial over-production. When, for instance, the market is glutted by shoes or calicoes or wines or colonial products, does this perhaps mean that four-sixths of the nation have more than satisfied their needs in shoes, calicoes, etc.? What after all has over-production to do with absolute needs? It is only concerned with demand that is backed by ability to pay. It is not a question of absolute over-production\u2014over-production as such in relation to the absolute need or the desire to possess commodities. In this sense there is neither partial nor general over-production; and the one is not opposed to the other.\u201d",
