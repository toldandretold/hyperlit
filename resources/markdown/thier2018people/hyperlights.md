> "The point to note is that the goal of such an exchange is qualitative (gaining new use-values) rather than quantitative (making money). The purpose is to procure a different item, which you did not possess before."

> "The development of professional traders transformed the goal of exchange from the procurement of like items for use to the accumulation of money. The equation thus changed from C-M-C to M-C-M; or more accurately M-C-M’. The doohickey above the M (“M prime,” technically speaking) represents _more_ money, or an increase of value above and beyond the money initially invested. In pre-capitalist societies, the basis for this added wealth was, more often than not, pilfering loot. Merchants from more economically developed centers were able to take advantage of societies that did not rely on large-scale internal trade. They could thus purchase goods on the cheap, and then sell them at a higher price in places where these goods were scarce and their values unknown."

The formula this changed means: from one persons perspective to another, though. For those trading to the merchants, it’s still c-m-c.

> "How do capitalists generate this ever-expanding surplus? Like the merchant class that preceded them, capitalists produce and exchange goods through an M-C-M’ circuit. They start with money (M), invest in the production of commodities (C), and then sell those commodities on the market to get back more money than they started with, (M’). Marx referred to this as “the general formula of capital.” Rather than money serving an _intermediary_ role, it is the _driver_ of the process."

---

> "The simple circulation of commodities—selling in order to buy—is a means to a final goal which lies outside circulation, namely the appropriation of use-values, the satisfaction of needs. As against this, the circulation of money as capital is an end in itself, for the valorization of value takes place only within this constantly renewed movement. The movement of capital is therefore limitless"

> "Rather than being cunning in the market, the key to surplus value is a production process that creates more wealth than it begins with. Contrary to mainstream explanations (see sidebar: “How Capitalism Explains Capital”), capitalist surplus is not generated within the realm of exchange at all. It is created, argued Marx, within “the hidden abode of production"

> "The exchange-value of labor-power is paid out in a wage. But the use-value of labor-power is _labor itself—_ the source of value, as we discussed in chapter two. What’s more, the exchange-value of labor-power, and the value that labor then produces for the bosses, are two very different things. The worker is paid one thing, but then will normally create much more value during her shift than she is paid:"

> "The value of labor-power, and the value which that labor-power valorizes in the labor-process, are two entirely different magnitudes; and this difference was what the capitalist had in mind when he was purchasing the labor-power…. What was really decisive for him was the specific use-value which this commodity possesses of being _a source not only of value, but of more value than it has itself."

> "That is to say, its value, like that of any other commodity, is based on the amount of labor that has gone into producing it. In the case of labor-power, this amounts to the labor-time required to keep the worker alive, to daily reproduce her capacity and readiness to go to work every day, and to keep her children alive, so that they may one day replace her in the workforce. The value of food, rent, clothing, training, and education, along with other necessities deemed essential by society therefore make up the value of labor-power."

> "In order to extract value out of the consumption of a commodity, our friend the money-owner must be lucky enough to find within the sphere of circulation, on the market, a commodity whose use-value possesses the peculiar property of being a _source of value_ , whose actual consumption, therefore is itself an objectification of labor, hence a creation of value. The possessor of money does find such a special commodity on the market: the capacity for labor, in other words labor-power.8 [emphasis added]"

> "The Marxist understanding of capitalism reveals, however, that surplus value is produced when capitalists are buying goods for their true value and selling them for their true value. It illustrates that surplus value, and therefore profits, are rooted in the production process—in the difference between paid and unpaid labor—not in the cunning of market-based exchanges."

---

> "If we pin down the specific forms of appearance assumed in turn by self-valorizing value in the course of its life, we reach the following elucidation: capital is money, capital is commodities. In truth, however, value is here the subject of a _process_ in which, while constantly assuming the form in turn of money and commodities, it changes its own magnitude, throws off surplus value from itself … and thus valorizes itself independently. For the movement in the course of which it adds surplus value is its _own_ movement, its valorization is therefore _self_ -valorization. By virtue of being value, it has acquired the occult ability to add value to itself. It brings forth living offspring, or at least lays golden eggs."

> "Yet for all this piracy, the circulation of money, wrote Mandel, “is _sterile_ from a global point of view; it does not increase the total wealth of human society. It consists in fact of a _transfer_ of wealth, pure and simple; what one gains the other loses, in absolute value. Social value remains unchanged.”"

> "The capitalist employs both “inputs” in a production process (P) that creates a new set of commodities, worth more than the combined value of the original inputs. The circuit of capital can thus be expanded to a more precise formula: M-C (MP+L) … P … C’-M’.7"

> "if all things were fair and just, you would give over to your boss only the amount of time that it takes to reproduce the value of your labor-power. Say it takes four hours to produce $120 worth of goods, the equivalent of your daily wage, you could go home after four hours. But if your boss allowed that, his inputs and outputs would be equal. It truly would just be M-C-M. What would be the point? Why not just keep the money he started with? But all things are _not_ fair and just. The capitalist pays you for the cost of your labor-power, not for the value of the goods you produce. Thus your paycheck is worth the _exchange-value_ of your labor-power. But the _use-value_ of your labor-power is the _production of greater value_."
