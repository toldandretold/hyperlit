> "The development of professional traders transformed the goal of exchange from the procurement of like items for use to the accumulation of money. The equation thus changed from C-M-C to M-C-M; or more accurately M-C-M’. The doohickey above the M (“M prime,” technically speaking) represents _more_ money, or an increase of value above and beyond the money initially invested. In pre-capitalist societies, the basis for this added wealth was, more often than not, pilfering loot. Merchants from more economically developed centers were able to take advantage of societies that did not rely on large-scale internal trade. They could thus purchase goods on the cheap, and then sell them at a higher price in places where these goods were scarce and their values unknown."

The formula this changed means: from one persons perspective to another, though. For those trading to the merchants, it’s still c-m-c.

> "How do capitalists generate this ever-expanding surplus? Like the merchant class that preceded them, capitalists produce and exchange goods through an M-C-M’ circuit. They start with money (M), invest in the production of commodities (C), and then sell those commodities on the market to get back more money than they started with, (M’). Marx referred to this as “the general formula of capital.” Rather than money serving an _intermediary_ role, it is the _driver_ of the process."

For the movement in the course of which it adds surplus value is its _own_ movement, its valorization is therefore _self_ -valorization. By virtue of being value, it has acquired the occult ability to add value to itself. It brings forth living offspring, or at least lays golden eggs."

> [↩](http://172.20.10.4:8000/thier2018people#unknown-user_1741003375698)


**Chat GPT**: "To securitize something means to transform an asset, typically an illiquid one, into a tradable financial instrument (a security). This process involves pooling various financial assetsâ€”like loans, mortgages, or receivablesâ€”and converting them into securities that can be sold to investors.

### How Securitization Works:

1. Asset Pooling: A financial institution bundles a group of similar assets (e.g., mortgages, car loans, credit card debt).
2. Creation of a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV): The assets are transferred to an SPV, a separate legal entity that will issue securities backed by these assets.
3. Issuance of Securities: The SPV sells securities (such as mortgage-backed securities or asset-backed securities) to investors, who receive payments based on the cash flows from the underlying assets.
4. Investors Get Paid: As borrowers repay their loans, the payments are passed on to investors in the form of interest and principal.

### Why Securitize?

Liquidity: Converts illiquid assets (like mortgages) into tradable securities.

Risk Distribution: Shifts risk from the originator (e.g., a bank) to investors.

Capital Efficiency: Frees up capital for financial institutions, allowing them to make more loans.

Example: Mortgage-Backed Securities (MBS)

A bank that issues home loans pools them together and sells them as MBS to investors. The investors then receive payments as homeowners pay their mortgages.

Securitization can be beneficial by spreading risk and increasing market efficiency, but it can also create systemic risksâ€”such as in the 2008 financial crisis, when excessive mortgage securitization led to market instability.”
