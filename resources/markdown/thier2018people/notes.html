<p>CHAPTER ONE: THE BIRTH OF CAPITAL</p>
<p><a href="#ch01note1" id="bch01note1">1</a>.<span></span>Marx, <em>Capital</em>, vol. 1, 925–926.</p>

<p><a href="#ch01note3" id="bch01note3">3</a>.<span></span>We’ll discuss classes in future chapters, but broadly defined, they are social groups with different relationships to the production and distribution of society’s wealth.</p>
<p><a href="#ch01note4" id="bch01note4">4</a>.<span></span>See Eleanor Burke Leacock, <em>Myths of Male Dominance</em> (New York: Monthly Review Press, 1981). Chris Harman also provides a broad overview of the origins of class society in: “Engels and the Origins of Human Society,” <em>International Socialism</em> 2, no. 65 (winter 1994). It is based on (and seeks to update) Engels’s seminal work, <em>The Origin of the Family, Private Property, and the State</em> (London: Penguin Classics, 2010).</p>

<p><a href="#ch01note6" id="bch01note6">6</a>.<span></span>Quoted in Leacock, <em>Myths</em>, 49.</p>
<p><a href="#ch01note7" id="bch01note7">7</a>.<span></span>The British Marxist Chris Harman summarized this point: “Such groups could not keep the surplus in their own hands at times when the whole of society was suffering great hardship unless they found ways of imposing their will on the rest of society, unless they established coercive structures, states, and legal codes and ideologies to back them up. But once such structures and such ideologies were in existence, they would perpetuate the control of the surplus by a certain group even when it no longer served the purpose of advancing production. A class which emerged as a spur to production would persist even when it was no longer such a spur.” Harman, “Engels and the Origins of Human Society,” <em>International Socialism</em> 2, no. 65, (winter 1994).</p>
<p><a href="#ch01note8" id="bch01note8">8</a>.<span></span>This long and complex history is outside the purview of what can be explained in a few short sentences here. A good summary can be found in Harman, “Engels and the Origins of Human Society,” <em>International Socialism</em> 2, no. 65, (winter 1994). See also James Scott, <em>Against the Grain</em> (New Haven: Yale University Press, 2017) for a fuller account.</p>
<p><a href="#ch01note9" id="bch01note9">9</a>.<span></span>Much of the debate revolves around what newly defined capitalism as against feudalism and which elements of the transition—the development of productive forces within feudalism, agrarian class struggle, the emergence of an international market—drove the process forward. A short introduction can be found within a brief debate: Paul Heideman and Jonah Birch, “In Defense of Political Marxism,” <em>International Socialist Review</em>, July 2013, https://isreview.org/issue/90/defense-political-marxism and Neil Davidson, “Is There Anything <a id="bpage_255"></a>to Defend in Political Marxism?” <em>International Socialist Review</em>, winter 2013–14, <a href="https://isreview.org/issue/91/there-anything-defend-politicalmarxism">https://isreview.org/issue/91/there-anything-defend-politicalmarxism</a>. Deeper overviews can be found in Robert Brenner, “Property and Progress: Where Adam Smith Went Wrong,” in <em>Marxist History-Writing for the Twenty-First Century</em>, ed. Chris Wickham (London: British Academy, 2007) and Chris Harman, “From Feudalism to Capitalism,” <em>International Socialism 2</em>, 45 (Winter 1989), 35–87, <a href="https://www.marxists.org/archive/harman/1989/xx/transition.html">https://www.marxists.org/archive/harman/1989/xx/transition.html</a>. A series of essays which debate the argument more fully can be found in T. H. Aston and C. H. E. Philpin, eds., <em>The Brenner Debate: Agrarian Class Structure and Economic Development in Pre-Industrial Europe</em> (New York: Cambridge University Press, 1987).</p>
<p><a href="#ch01note10" id="bch01note10">10</a>.<span></span>Trade and markets, which expanded during this period, allowed lords to purchase luxuries and weaponry. To a lesser extent, peasants also used markets to sell excess crops to get cash for salt or other basic items. But so long as they were able to till their own land and produce the necessities of survival, they were not dependent on the market to sell their produce or buy goods from others. Despite the increasing production of non-agricultural goods and their exchange over the course of many centuries, economies remained primarily agricultural. Commodity production of goods sold on a market still existed only in pockets of society. The majority of the population—still as much as 80 or 90 percent worldwide between 1400 and 1800—lived in the country, subsisted on the meager foods and goods of their own production, and couldn’t afford to buy the products of the town’s craftsmen. See Robert Marks, <em>The Origins of the Modern World: A Global and Environmental Narrative from the Fifteenth to the Twenty-First Century</em> (Lanham: Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2015), 21.</p>

<p><a href="#ch01note12" id="bch01note12">12</a>.<span></span>Marx, <em>Capital</em>, vol. 1, 873.</p>
<p><a href="#ch01note13" id="bch01note13">13</a>.<span></span>Marx wrote: “The history of this expropriation assumes different aspects in different countries, and runs through its various phases in different orders of succession, and at different historical epochs. Only in England, which we therefore take as our example, has it the classic form.” Marx, <em>Capital</em>, vol 1, 876.</p>
<p><a href="#ch01note14" id="bch01note14">14</a>.<span></span>William Cobbett, <em>Rural Rides, Project Gutenberg e-book, 17</em>. Karl Marx wrote about Cobbett: “The great changes attending the decomposition of the old English Society since the eighteenth century struck his eyes and made his heart bleed.” Karl Marx, “Layard’s Inquiry. Fight over the Ten-Hour Working Day,” <em>New York Daily Tribune</em>, July 22, 1853, <a href="https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1853/07/22a.htm">https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1853/07/22a.htm</a>. Marx wrote glowingly about Cobbett’s writings, but he also critiqued the limitations of his political understanding. “But if he saw the effects, he did not understand the causes, the new social agencies at work. He did not see the modern bourgeoisie, but only that fraction of the aristocracy which held the hereditary monopoly of office, and which sanctioned by law all the changes necessitated by the new wants and pretensions of the middle-class. He saw the machine, but not the hidden motive power.”</p>

<p><a href="#ch01note16" id="bch01note16">16</a>.<span></span><a id="bpage_256"></a>These processes, which have often been attributed solely to European advances, were in fact taking place in China, India, and Egypt among others. The technical and manufacturing prowess in China was particularly advanced, and developed much earlier than comparable European accomplishments. Chinese engineering, transportation, and mechanization feats, many of which took hold centuries before they were known in Europe—from printing to the magnetic compass to the ploughshare to windmills—propelled the Chinese economy forward.</p>

<p><a href="#ch01note28" id="bch01note28">28</a>.<span></span>Consider the role of border police and immigration officers in threatening violence and deportation on migrant workers, the role of mass incarceration on African-American and Latinx communities, or the role of police and National Guard at picket lines. The threat—and use—of violence keeps communities disempowered and economically desperate and backs up the otherwise day-to-day, “smooth” operations of capitalist relations.</p>

<p><a href="#ch01note30" id="bch01note30">30</a>.<span></span>Economic progress for the new order meant, of course, progress in productivity and therefore profits. It did not translate into <em>human</em> progress and the equitable distribution of goods to meet needs!</p>

Ran away from the subscriber, a Negro girl, named Maria. She is of a copper color, between 13 and 14 years of age—bareheaded and barefooted. She is small for her age—very sprightly and very likely. She stated that she was going to see her mother at Maysville.” Or “Fifty Dollars reward. Ran away from the subscriber, his Negro man Pauladore, commonly called Paul. I understand Gen R. Y. Hayne has purchased his wife and children from H. L. Pinckney, Esq., and has them on his plantation at Goosecreek, where, no doubt, the fellow is frequently lurking.” W. E. B.

<p><a href="#ch01note40" id="bch01note40">40</a>.<span></span>Walter Rodney described in his groundbreaking book, <em>How Europe Underdeveloped Africa</em>: “In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, the Portuguese carried most of the East African ivory which was marketed in India; while Indian cloth and beads were sold in East and West Africa by the Portuguese, Dutch, English, and French. The same applied to cowry shells from the East Indies. Therefore, by control of the seas, Europe took the first steps towards transforming several parts of Africa and Asia into economic satellites.”</p>

<p><a href="#ch01note43" id="bch01note43">43</a>.<span></span>Marx wrote: “These methods depend in part on brute force, for instance the colonial system.

Ricardo investigated the law of value more systematically than did Smith, though Marx sees both as limited and contradictory.

Thus Greeks and Romans adopted the ox as the first universal equivalent down to the sixth and fifth centuries BCE. The Indians’ word for the national currency, <em>rupee</em>, is derived from <em>rupa</em>, meaning a herd. The Iranians of the <em>Avesta</em> and the Germans of the <em>Lex Saxonum</em> also chose the ox as the universal equivalent, which indicates the predominance of cattle-raising in the epoch when this happened. In North, East, and South Africa, cattle, in the shape of camels, sheep, goats or cows, likewise constituted the universal <a id="bpage_261"></a>equivalent among people who were essentially cattle-breeders,” Mandel, <em>Marxist Economic Theory</em>, vol. 1, 74.</p>

<p><a href="#ch03note21" id="bch03note21">21</a>.<span></span>The transformation in the nature of agriculture was producing surplus far beyond what was possible through small-scale subsistence farming. At the same time, large landowners increasingly collected rent in money form, rather than rent-in-kind (i.e. in the form of goods). Money thus grew out of the confines of pockets of the elite. “Agricultural rents had to be paid in money, not in kind; more and more people were earning a daily wage and not living on subsistence production, and this meant a growing domestic market. People increasingly went over to commercial or industrial production of such things as wine, brandy, and dye-stuffs,” Pierre Vilar, <em>A History of Gold and Money, 1450 to 1920</em> (New York: Verso, 1991), 259.</p>

In exchange he receives just as much, and no more, of the necessaries of life as is required to keep up the repetition of the same bargain every day. The workman gives as much, the Capitalist gives as little, as the nature of the bargain will admit. This is a very peculiar sort of fairness.” Engels, “A Fair Day’s Wages for a Fair Day’s Work,” <em>Labour Standard</em> no. 1, May 7, 1881.</p>

<p><a href="#ch04note21" id="bch04note21">21</a>.<span></span>The rate of surplus value is the same as the ratio of surplus labor to necessary labor. Marx explained: “In other words, the rate of surplus value, s/v = surplus labor/necessary labor. Both ratios, s/v and surplus labor/necessary labor, express the same thing in different ways; in the one case in the form of objectified labor, in the other in the form of living, fluid labor. The rate of surplus value is therefore an exact expression for the degree of exploitation of labor-power by capital, or the worker by the capitalist.” See Marx, <em>Capital</em>, vol. 1, 326. However, in the simplified version of this same example, I said the ratio of surplus labor/necessary labor was 7/1. This is because here we didn’t account for the capitalists’ expenditure of constant capital. Once we take this into account, we see that the ratio of necessary to surplus labor is 4:1, or 6.4 hours of surplus labor to 1.6 hours of necessary labor.</p>

But the overall point is that higher wages do not always translate to lower rates of exploitation. Furthermore these “comfortable” jobs are not guaranteed, as higher-paid workers are pushed to work faster for stagnating wages, see their benefits cut, and lose jobs when factories close in order to pay substantially lower wages elsewhere. Boeing, for instance, announced in 2014 the relocation of its engineering center from Washington State (where engineer salaries averaged $125,000 a year) to Alabama (where the going rate is $89,000). See Leada Gore, “Boeing will save $60,000 per job by moving engineering center to Alabama; average salary will be $89,000,” <em><a href="http://AL.com">AL.com</a></em>, April 27, 2014, <a href="http://www.al.com/business/index.ssf/2014/04/boeing_will_save_60000_per_job.html">http://www.al.com/business/index.ssf/2014/04/boeing_will_save_60000_per_job.html</a>.</p>

<p><a href="#ch04note44" id="bch04note44">44</a>.<span></span>Whether or not teachers or nurses are considered part of the working class has been debated by Marxists and other radical labor historians. See endnote 195. A related point of debate is whether those that work for the government (as opposed to private, for-profit schools, or other companies, as Marx’s quote about the teacher in the “teaching factory” refers to) are producing surplus value, and if not, how this impacts their classification as workers (or as “proletarians,” a term which Marx often used interchangeably with the term workers, but sometimes distinguished as only those “productive workers” who produce surplus value). See endnote 189. However you address these questions, it seems evident that public-sector workers face working-class conditions, have higher representation by unions, are often at the forefront of strikes and class struggle, and hold significant social power.</p>
<p><a href="#ch04note45" id="bch04note45">45</a>.<span></span>Marx, <em>Capital</em>, vol. 1, 644. Marx here is referring to the concept of a “productive” worker, versus an unproductive one, in order to specifically delineate workers who generate surplus value. “Unproductive” workers are also workers; they just have a different relationship to the creation of capital. American socialist Hal Draper had a very useful description of the working class as existing in concentric circles. An industrial “core” sits strategically at the center of capitalist production, while outer rings of workers are less likely to be direct producers, but nonetheless contribute to the collective process of the extraction of surplus value. See Hal Draper, <em>Karl Marx’s Theory of Revolution: The Politics of Social Classes</em>, vol. 2, (New York: Monthly Review Press, 1978), 35–38.</p>

These estimates include some teachers, social workers, and other professions, which Zweig and Moody both classify as a <a id="bpage_266"></a>mixed bag of some middle-class and some working-class jobs. These professions, Moody and Zweig argue, are proletarianizing professions. And this is particularly significant because, as Moody points out, many of these proletarianizing professionals are today leading some of the most militant class struggles in the US. My take is that teachers and nurses have not had enough autonomy or independence to be considered part of the middle class for a long time, and certainly not today in the days of “teaching to the test.” Even if a degree of flexibility within the classroom affords some creativity on the job, teachers have no control over any of the basic parameters of the job—size of the class and therefore workload, schedule, benefits, etc. I also think that greater sections of many other professions from accountants to web developers should be accounted for within the ranks of the working class. Many of these jobs entail routinized and tedious tasks, require long hours, and offer meager compensation. Lastly, though supervisors can generally be considered part of the middle class, there are many instances in which this is not the case. Many, if not most, of BLS-classified “first line supervisors” in retail and food prep/service jobs, for instance, are probably working class. These supervisors often have such “privileges” as coming up with shift schedules or opening or closing the store, but have no jurisdiction to hire and fire, or hold any other meaningful authority. Taking into consideration these variables, my own very rough analysis of data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics led me to estimate that these numbers could be as high as 75 percent.</p>

In the meantime, take the example of a company like Etsy, founded as a quirky e-commerce shop for handmade items by three Brooklyn hipsters in 2005. By 2011, the company’s board had pushed out its founders, and in 2013 they changed their terms of service to allow the sale of manufactured goods. By 2015, Etsy generated over $2 billion dollars in sales, but, still not generating a profit to satisfy shareholders, pushed out another CEO in 2017, laid off 8 percent of its staff, and brought in former American Express executive Josh Silverman as CEO. Company balconies were locked to keep employees from jumping, as layoffs were announced.</p>
<p><a href="#ch04note57" id="bch04note57">57</a>.<span></span>In addition to increasing the amount of surplus value extracted from the workforce through an extension of the workday, capitalists also have an interest in making sure their machines are always running. They are in a race against time to get the most use out of their investments before moral depreciation devalues their equipment, and therefore the value that these machines or technologies pass on to their products.</p>

Even in the United Kingdom, where the medical profession receives more independent, publicly-funded information than in many other countries, promotional spending by pharmaceuticals companies is fifty times greater than spending on public information on health.” See “Pharmaceutical Industry,” World Health Organization website, <a href="http://www.who.int/trade/glossary/story073/en/">http://www.who.int/trade/glossary/story073/en/</a>.</p>

<p><a href="#ch06note21" id="bch06note21">21</a>.<span></span>During a crisis of overproduction, the value of money can rise if prices of goods have dropped due to oversupply. If the prices drop, each dollar essentially has more buying power, and therefore is worth more. Investors aren’t then interested in purchasing goods to sell, or in buying materials for further production, since they know that those products will be worth less on the market. They’d rather have extra dollars, which at this point are rising in value.</p>

<p><a href="#ch06note23" id="bch06note23">23</a>.<span></span>The logic of capitalism is of course at complete odds with the logic of humanity! The point of housing, its use-value, is to provide shelter. But this use is refracted through the need to make profits, and so houses are viewed as assets to buy, collect, resell. Further, as we’ll discuss in future chapters, investment in mortgage-related financial products helped to inflate prices even higher. When the bubble popped, millions couldn’t pay their mortgages and faced foreclosures, and families lost their homes. Capitalism’s solution is not to find ways to keep people in their houses (much less to house the homeless!) but to try and find ways to restore profitability to the banks and to the real estate industry. Rather than reining in banks and financial institutions, nothing was done to provide homeowner relief, or to make houses more affordable.</p>

<p><a href="#ch06note41" id="bch06note41">41</a>.<span></span>Marx, <em>Theories of Surplus Value</em>, chapter 17, section 12. Regarding Ricardo’s argument, Marx quotes him here: “Too much of a particular commodity may be produced, of which there may be such a glut in the market, as not to repay the capital expended on it; but this cannot be the case with respect to all commodities; the demand for corn is limited by the mouths which are to eat it, for shoes and coats by the persons who are to wear them; but though a community, or a part of a community, may have as much corn, and as many hats and shoes, as it is able or may wish to consume, the same <em>cannot be said of every commodity produced by nature or by art</em>. Some would consume more wine, if they had the ability to procure it. Others having enough of wine, would wish to increase the quantity or improve the quality of their furniture. Others might wish to ornament their grounds, or to enlarge their houses. The wish to do all or some of these is implanted in every man’s breast; <em>nothing is required but the means, and nothing can afford the means, but an increase of production.</em>” Marx replies, in part: “What is the purpose of all this? In periods of over-production, a large part of the nation (especially the working class) is less well provided than ever with corn, shoes etc., not to speak of wine and furniture. If over-production could only occur when all the members of a nation had satisfied even their most urgent needs, there could never, in the history of bourgeois society up to now, have been a state of general over-production or even of partial over-production. When, for instance, the market is glutted by shoes or calicoes or wines or colonial products, does this perhaps mean that four-sixths of the nation have more <a id="bpage_276"></a>than satisfied their needs in shoes, calicoes, etc.? What after all has over-production to do with absolute needs? It is only concerned with demand that is backed by ability to pay. It is not a question of absolute over-production—over-production as such in relation to the absolute need or the desire to possess commodities. In this sense there is neither partial nor general over-production; and the one is not opposed to the other.”</p>

<p><a href="#ch06note83" id="bch06note83">83</a>.<span></span>It’s important to note that the ratio of physical machinery to concrete labor is different than how much capital is invested. (It might cost $20 a day to utilize the loom and $10 a day to hire the weaver.) This is why Marx distinguished between the “technical composition” of capital (one laborer to one loom) and the “value composition” of capital ($20 dollars to $10 dollars). There’s clearly a relationship between the technical and organic compositions of capital, but you can see how they might change at different rates. Marx wrote: “By the composition of capital we mean… the ratio between its active and its passive component, between variable and constant capital. Two relationships are involved here… The first relationship depends on technical conditions and is to be taken as given, at any particular stage of development of productivity… A definite number of workers corresponds to a definite quantity of means of production… The <em>organic</em> composition of capital is the name we give to its value composition, insofar as this is determined by its technical composition and reflects it.” Marx, <em>Capital</em>, vol. 3, 244–245.</p>
<p><a href="#ch06note84" id="bch06note84">84</a>.<span></span>In chapter one we talked about Joseph Marie Jacquard, who invented the mechanical loom in 1804. His father was a master weaver, who could fabricate six inches of silk in a week. The mechanical loom could produce fourteen feet in a week. The three thousand meters now possible equals almost <em>ten thousand feet a week</em>.</p>

<p><a href="#ch06note89" id="bch06note89">89</a>.<span></span>Since the last set of printers were not used for the full ten years that they were anticipated to last, this is value that is lost.

<p><a href="#ch06note93" id="bch06note93">93</a>.<span></span>This process, as we’ll discuss soon in the section on “countervailing tendencies,” also cheapens the creation of the means of production, thereby reducing constant capital and easing the pressure on the profit rate’s fall.</p>
<p><a href="#ch06note94" id="bch06note94">94</a>.<span></span>The equalization of profit rates is one of the key reasons why (as we discussed in chapter three) prices diverge from their values.</p>

<p><a href="#ch06note97" id="bch06note97">97</a>.<span></span>It should be noted that these savings cannot be applied retroactively by those companies which, like BigBucks, already spent $10 million on their printers. For them, the drain on profitability is even greater. Now their printers pass on 20 percent less value, while the amount that they initially invested remains the same.</p>
<p><a href="#ch06note98" id="bch06note98">98</a>.<span></span>A high turnover of capital is also the secret behind the success of fast food chains. They sell products cheaply (reflecting the shorter socially necessary labor-time needed to make McDonald’s Big Macs), but they turn over capital quickly from the initial investments in raw materials, labor, and equipment, to the sale of the food items.</p>
<p><a href="#ch06note99" id="bch06note99">99</a>.<span></span>Some Marxists, like Michael Roberts, do contend that the tendency for the rate of profit to fall is the main motor for cyclical crises because booms produce an expansion of production and investments in technology, leading to falls in profit rates, while the destruction of capital characteristic of crises lead to sharp falls in the organic composition of capital thereby restoring profitability.</p>
<p><a href="#ch06note100" id="bch06note100">100</a>.<span></span>Capitalism’s need for unemployment, referred to by Marx sometimes as “surplus population,” sometimes as “reserve army of laborers,” is also discussed in chapter 4.</p>

<p><a href="#ch07note68" id="bch07note68">68</a>.<span></span>These bubbles would implode first in the dot-com industry in 2001, and a few years later in the housing industry. The one bubble gave way to the other. After the dot-com bubble burst, the Federal Reserve responded with lowering interest rates from 6.5% to 1% between 2001 and 2003 in order to jump-start the economy. This gave banks easy credit to extend mortgages and other loans. At the same time, investors increasingly looked to mortgage-backed securities for a higher return than the 1% offered by Federal Reserve. Both of these trends fed into the creation of a housing bubble. Meanwhile, more investors took money out of the stock market after the crash and invested in real estate. As Yale economist Robert Shiller argued: “Once stocks fell, real estate became the primary outlet for the speculative frenzy that the stock market had unleashed.” See Jonathan R. Laing, “The Bubble’s New Home,” <em>Barron’s</em>, June 20, 2005.</p>
