<p class="chap_title"><strong>THE ACCUMULATION OF CAPITAL</strong></p>
<p class="block">[The capitalist] shares with the miser an absolute drive towards self-enrichment. But what appears in the miser as the mania of an individual is in the capitalist the effect of the social mechanism in which he is merely a cog.</p>
<p class="blockr"><em>Capital, Volume 1<a href="19_bm006.html#ch05note1" id="ch05note1"><sup>1</sup></a></em></p>
<p class="h3">COMPETE OR GO BUST</p>
<p class="noindent">“Henry Ford might insist, as he continually did,” wrote socialist novelist Upton Sinclair, “that competition was wrong, and that he did not believe in it; but the fact was that he was competing at every moment in his life, and would continue to do so as long as he made motor-cars. In a hundred different plants scattered over the United States, efforts were being made to beat him. In the long run, the successful ones would be those who contrived, by one method or another, to get the most out of a dollar’s worth of labor.”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch05note2" id="ch05note2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">Competition is the beating heart of capitalism. It drives production forward and, as we’ll see, fuels the dynamism of the system. Individual capitalists may fancy themselves as above the fray. They may want to position themselves as caring capitalists. Or they may rise to heights in their industry that make them appear to be untouchable. But in the end, no capitalist can opt out of competing and none is protected from upstart challengers. Even powerful monopolists—whether Henry Ford or Bill Gates—can’t stay ahead of the competition indefinitely.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_104"/>It was, after all, competition—the need to dominate the automobile market at the expense of any emerging car company—that drove Ford to revolutionize how cars were produced. Mass assembly created the conditions for less labor intensive and therefore cheaper car production. This allowed Ford to sell Model Ts at half the price of other cars, winning the company the dominant position within the new automobile industry.</p>
<p class="indent">To understand why competition is central to capitalism, consider again the circuit of capital: M-C-M’. Money (M) is invested in order to create commodities (C), which are then sold for more money than originally outlaid (M’). But the dash between C and M’ is always a question mark for the capitalist. It is one thing to produce surplus value; it is another thing to then sell the goods and make an actual profit. In other words, surplus value is <em>created</em> in production, but only <em>realized</em> in exchange. Will commodities find buyers? The “free” and anonymous market forces capitalists to compete with one another to capture consumers.</p>
<p class="image"><img alt="image" src="../images/img112-01.jpg"/></p>
<p class="indent">In the previous chapter we saw just how <em>organized</em> production under capitalism is, often timed to the second. This level of internal coordination by individual capitalists is a necessary means to staying on top of, or ahead of, socially necessary labor-time. In this chapter we will discuss the very <em>disorganized</em> and unplanned process of capitalist exchange faced by capital as a whole. The organization of production, as Engles argued in <em>Anti-Dühring</em>, is mirrored by its exact opposite in the anarchy of the market:</p>
<p class="blocka">[E]very society resting on commodity production has the peculiarity, that in it the producers have lost the command over their own social relations. Each produces for himself with the means of production which he happens to have, and for his individual exchange requirements. No one knows how much of his article is coming on the market, or how much of it will be wanted; no one knows whether his particular product will meet an actual demand, whether he will be able to cover his costs of production or even be able to sell his commodity at all. Anarchy reigns in social production…</p>
<p class="block1">The anarchy of social production made itself evident and became more and more extreme. But the chief instrument with which the capitalistic method of production intensified this anarchy in social production, was the exact opposite of anarchy, namely, the increasing organization of production, on a social basis, in each individual productive establishment. With this lever, it made an end of the old peaceful stability. Wherever it was introduced in a branch of industry, it brooked no older method of production by its side. Wherever it took possession of handicraft, it annihilated the old handicraft. The field of labor became a battleground… The contradiction between socialized production and capitalistic appropriation is reproduced <em>as the antagonism between the organization of production in the single factory, and the anarchy of production in society as a whole.</em><a href="19_bm006.html#ch05note3" id="ch05note3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_105"/>As we unpack the workings of the market, doing so will shed light on why capitalists are obliged to accumulate evermore capital, invest in mechanization, and continually advance the forces of production. We’ll see too the consequences of that <small>ACCUMULATION</small>, which gives rise on the one hand to inventiveness and technological vigor, and on the other hand to their counterparts: monopolies, companies that are “too big to fail,” and imperialist instability.</p>
<p class="h3">ANARCHY REIGNS</p>
<p class="noindent">In the idealized version of capitalism touted by mainstream economics, everything that is produced is consumed, and capitalists reap the full benefit of their investments by selling the whole of their product. In reality, they must distribute their profits among a number of other capitalists (see sidebar: “Capitalist Hangers-On”). What’s more, selling all—or even most—of their product is far from guaranteed. Each firm must compete for buyers within a market that they do not control. And even if they <em>could</em> control the market, they cannot control their competitors.</p>
<p class="indent">If every industry were made up of just one company selling goods, then that business would only need to make sure that its commodities were useful to some group of people with the cash to purchase them. Instead several (and sometimes many more) firms compete with each other to reach potential buyers. Each need to command ever-greater market shares in order to survive. If they don’t, others will grow at their expense.</p>
<p class="indent">Companies can expand their share of the market through branding and marketing or through pricing reductions. Or they can reinvest their capital elsewhere if their current line of business is tapped out (much as phone companies did when they shifted financing from landlines to cellular networks). But they neither make these calculations in collaboration with other capitalists, nor do they know with certainty which direction the market will go.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_106"/>Their first problem is that markets are anonymous and undefined—even in the days of “big data,” which follows potential consumer activity online and offline. No matter how diligently or creepily Facebook tracks your every movement for marketers, companies can only take guesses as to who their potential buyers are, where they can be found, and whether or when they will ultimately decide to pull the trigger to buy. Trying to predict the answers to these questions in order to plan investment and production has driven a boom in “data mining” and marketing analytics.</p>
<p class="indent">As <em>New York Times</em> journalist Charles Duhigg explained, companies purchase information about “your ethnicity, job history, the magazines you read, if you’ve ever declared bankruptcy or got divorced, the year you bought (or lost) your house, where you went to college, what kinds of topics you talk about online, whether you prefer certain brands of coffee, paper towels, cereal or applesauce, your political leanings, reading habits, charitable giving and the number of cars you own.” Andreas Weigend, former chief scientist at Amazon.com, told Duhigg, “It’s like an arms race to hire statisticians nowadays.”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch05note4" id="ch05note4"><sup>4</sup></a> Yet these and other tools of “demand forecasting” still do not offer a reliable means to predict the size and scope of a market.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch05note5" id="ch05note5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">Second, no matter how hard analysts try to pin down the spending capacity of their consumer base, markets are constantly changing and their directions are unknown. They contract and expand, new ones are created, old ones collapse. Failing to predict or set the terms of the market in a given industry can drive a once-thriving company out of business.</p>
<p class="indent">Automakers, for example, cannot be sure which types of cars will dominate in the coming years. All of them must constantly spend money on research and development of new systems, not knowing whether these investments will help them secure a leading position or will be money down the drain. As Toyota’s chief executive complained: “For the last hundred years, gasoline engines have occupied the mainstream, but if you look forward a hundred years, it will not just be gasoline, but diesel, electrics, plug-in hybrids and fuel-cell vehicles. We don’t know yet which will be chosen.”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch05note6" id="ch05note6"><sup>6</sup></a> Or perhaps the terrifying trend to “self-driving” cars will take off. (Thank you, capitalism. What could possibly go wrong?)</p>
<p class="indent">Moreover, established car companies are looking over their shoulders at young upstarts like Tesla, which is spending billions of dollars on research and development to create mass-marketable electric cars. If they succeed in automating manufacture to more cheaply produce (and therefore sell) their cars, Tesla could go from obscure upstart to serious competitor in a new field.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_107"/>Third, each company sets the scope of production independently, with little knowledge of what other firms are planning. In setting production quotas, each corporation’s profit is the motive, rather than the industry’s overall economic health, let alone social need. The heads of major corporations don’t sit together and discuss: “Ok, how many people need our gadgets? … So, who’s going to make how many? … Great! We have a plan!” Even in cases where competitors engage in price collusion in order to team up for greater profits, this collaboration is between a “band of hostile brothers,” as Marx called the ruling class, and by necessity any alliance eventually breaks down as the race for market share resumes.</p>
<p class="indent">Rather than cooperating, every company angles for greater sales at the expense of their rivals. This competition keeps capitalism in a constant state of motion as businesses hustle to gain efficiencies and push out companies that are not keeping up. Technology must constantly be updated to make cheaper goods. This is why even a corporation like Apple, among the largest corporations in the world, with an estimated value of $1 trillion at the time of this book’s writing, can’t just coast to stay profitable.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch05note7" id="ch05note7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">A look at any of Apple’s products explains why. The iPod, iPhone, and iPad all came into the market as products that had not previously existed. Apple was able to effectively advertise these products and cultivate an audience of willing buyers, even at high prices. The first generation of iPods were $400–$500, depending on the size of their drive. But in the case of each of these products, other competitors soon entered the market at lower prices, elbowing Apple out of market share and forcing the company to innovate its technologies to create faster, more efficient products at cheaper prices.</p>
<p class="indent">So while Apple dominated the early years of the smartphone market, Android’s share of mobile browsing has long surpassed Apple’s iOS. The price of Android phones (which aren’t controlled by a single corporation, and therefore enter more ruthlessly into price wars) has fallen every year since 2011, and are now roughly a third of the average iPhone.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch05note8" id="ch05note8"><sup>8</sup></a> The scramble to control the market sets every company on a manic path to produce more and better, faster, cheaper products. In 2015, Apple hustled to get the iPad Pro out before Microsoft’s Surface Pro 4 came out—and it needed to prove itself the greater value, that it can do more, and costs less. Of course, by the time you read this book, several newer lines of iPads will have competed with the latest lines of Surfaces or Kindle Fires or an as-of-yet unknown brand.</p>
<p class="indent">Though companies spend significant resources on branding and advertising to convince buyers that their products are best, the race to innovate is largely driven by the socially necessary labor-time that it takes to create products. Every company must sell goods at or below the average market price. The more a company gains efficiencies in production by reducing labor-time, the more cheaply they can sell their goods, and the more likely that they will capture buyers by underselling their competitors. Conversely, if a seller has a high cost of production, he will be forced to find ways to lower his costs, or risk going out of business. As Marx explained: “The battle of competition is fought by the cheapening of commodities”: that is reducing their value through a reduction in labor-time.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch05note9" id="ch05note9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_108"/>Automation allows a company to generate as much, or more, revenue with fewer workers. This is precisely what Henry Ford did by introducing the moving assembly line. Capitalists are constantly looking to reduce the number of workers they need to employ by greater use of technology, though these changes may have more or less revolutionary effects than Ford’s assembly line.</p>
<p class="indent">In recent years, for instance, health care providers for the aging have begun to rely on telehealth and patient monitoring technologies to reduce costs of administering care, and of sending doctors or nurses to peoples’ homes. Demand for patient monitoring systems, which allow agencies to cut back on the number of hours aides must spend with older adults living at home, has grown dramatically in recent years.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch05note10" id="ch05note10"><sup>10</sup></a> “Sensors can be placed around the home,” wrote <em>InformationWeek</em> reporter Alison Diana, “on doors and windows—as well as in appliances and on the patient. They alert caregivers if the senior misses a meal, doesn’t get out of bed, or falls.” They can even tell the caregiver if their patient has left the water running too long.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch05note11" id="ch05note11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">Each company must <em>at minimum</em> have enough technological capability to manufacture widgets (or deliver health care services) as quickly as its competitors do. At best, it will innovate <em>before</em> its rivals do, thus reducing the cost of production and the prices of its goods. Marked-down prices then translate into greater market share, a higher profit margin, and a dominant position in the industry. The scramble to reduce the cost of production forces capitalists to ceaselessly advance the instruments of production, or be left behind. sAs Marx and Engels vividly described in the pages of the <em>Communist Manifesto</em>:</p>
<p class="block">The bourgeoisie cannot exist without constantly revolutionizing the instruments of production, and thereby the relations of production, and with them the whole relations of society. Conservation of the old modes of production in unaltered form, was, on the contrary, the first condition of existence for all earlier industrial classes. Constant revolutionizing of production, uninterrupted disturbance of all social conditions, everlasting uncertainty and agitation distinguish the bourgeois epoch from all earlier ones. All fixed, fast-frozen relations, with their train of ancient and venerable prejudices and opinions, are swept away, all new-formed ones become antiquated before they can ossify. All that is solid melts into air, all that is holy is profaned, and man is at last compelled to face with sober senses his real conditions of life, and his relations with his kind.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch05note12" id="ch05note12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<div class="box3">
<p class="box-head"><a id="page_109"/><strong>CAPITALIST HANGERS-ON</strong></p>
<p class="noindent">Capitalists must distribute their profits among a number of other capitalists before reinvesting the rest into the next round of production.</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s say you’re in the business of making action figures. Your initial output of M, $10,000, is split into a few components: 1) materials such as rubber, acrylic paints, glue, and so on; 2) sculpting tools and assembly machinery; and 3) labor costs for the designers, engineers, assemblers, and marketers. As we discussed in the previous chapter, the first two components are constant capital. The plastic and other materials pass on their complete value into the final product, while the machinery and tools pass on their value piecemeal through the wear and tear of their use. The final component—labor-power—is variable capital, and reproduces itself, and additionally a surplus value.</p>
<p class="indent">At the end of the production cycle, the action figures sell for a total of $15,000. The increased profit reflects the added value of labor that went into converting raw materials into a new product. Within this total, $10,000 replaces the initial investment, but the last $5,000 doesn’t all go back to you as extra profit. Presumably, if some or all of the initial outlay of $10,000 was borrowed—either from a bank, or in the form of stocks or other means, at least some of the extra $5,000 will then pay back the interest on those loans, or dividends to shareholders. Other sections of the profits are disbursed to cover real estate costs in the form of rent to a landlord or as a mortgage payment to a bank. In addition, a part of the surplus goes to the state through taxes.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_110"/>In this way the exploitation of workers must support not only the capitalists that directly employ them, but a whole string of other hangers-on. A capitalist producing action figures is a “productive capitalist” because workers employed by him are producing commodities and surplus value. Other sections of the capitalist class—“unproductive capitalists”—don’t directly engage in the production of surplus value, but nonetheless play significant roles in allowing surplus value to be created.</p>
<p class="indent">Finance capitalists, for instance, play the role of taking surplus value realized in one part of the system and deploying it to another through loans or direct investments. (The financial system will be discussed further in chapter seven). States create the conditions that allow for production to happen smoothly (police to protect private property, infrastructure that allows for ease of transporting commodities, trade laws that favor domestic business, etc.). And landlords manage properties, in some cases indirectly contributing value to production. Take, for example, Chicago, where there is a high concentration of warehouses stemming from the city’s geographic centrality. The ability of companies to stock their goods in these warehouses is central to their ability to then deploy and sell them.</p>
<p class="indent">All of these processes facilitate the creation and realization of surplus value, though none produce surplus value in and of themselves.</p>
</div>
<p class="h3">MOSES AND THE PROPHETS</p>
<p class="noindent">The disciplining force of socially necessary labor-time propels capitalists to constantly “accumulate”—that is to transform surplus value into further capital. It isn’t the case that each capitalist wants to make a greater profit than his neighbor so that he’ll feel himself a bigger man. Nor is the drive for profit driven by his insatiable thirst for more luxuries. Rather, he desperately needs to accumulate more capital in order to get hold of the latest, most efficient, laborsaving automation. The bigger the profit of an individual capitalist, the more quickly he’ll be able to invest in these technologies, ahead of his competitors. In the words of Dell Computers founder and CEO, Michael Dell, corporations must “grow or die.” (See sidebar: “Capitalists Grow or Die.”) As Engels explained:</p>
<p class="block"><a id="page_111"/>We have seen that the perfectibility of modern machinery, developed to the highest degree, becomes transformed by means of the anarchy of production in society into a compulsory law for the individual industrial capitalist constantly to improve his machinery, constantly to increase its productive power. The bare factual possibility of extending his sphere of production, becomes transformed, for him, into a similar compulsory law. The enormous expansive force of modern industry, in comparison with which that of gases is veritable child’s play, appears now before our eyes as a qualitative and quantitative <em>need</em> to expand which laughs at all resistance.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch05note13" id="ch05note13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p class="noindent">In the auto industry, for instance, the average time between redesigns of new models is five years. Automobile technology for electric motors, multispeed automatic transmissions, battery power, and engine power is continually updated to provide “more car for your money.” If a car company comes out with a new vehicle that does not significantly improve upon older models, it will spend those years between redesigns losing market share until it can produce a new model.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch05note14" id="ch05note14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">Marx, therefore, made the point that it is not enough to generate surplus value; it must be reinvested. The part of surplus value that is consumed by capitalists themselves is <em>revenue</em>, while the part that is employed as capital is <small>ACCUMULATED</small>. If bosses merely spent their profits on luxuries, production would not expand, and capitalists would not have the means to innovate. “[W]hat does this surplus product consist of?” asked Marx: “Only of things destined to satisfy the needs and desires of the capitalist class, things which consequently enter into the consumption fund of the capitalists? If that were all, the cup of surplus value would be drained to the very dregs, and nothing but simple reproduction would ever take place.”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch05note15" id="ch05note15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">Of course, the ruling class <em>does</em> spend an exorbitant amount of money on themselves. Millions of dollars are poured into mansions, yachts, parties, watches, art, and all manner of sundry luxuries. Venture capitalist Marc Bell recently put his Boca Raton mansion up for sale for nearly $25 million, so he could move into larger digs in Miami. Along with a “natural” swimming pool that features waterfalls over sculpted stone, a spa and a basketball court on the property’s 1.6 acres, his mansion also includes a “Star Trek” home theatre, which replicates the main bridge of the Starship Enterprise, complete with proper “swooshing” sounds every time the doors open or close.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch05note16" id="ch05note16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">As a 2018 Oxfam report revealed, the richest forty-two people own the same combined wealth as the world’s poorest 3.7 billion. In the US, the wealth of the three richest people equals that of the bottom half of the population. This gap grows by the day. In the economic crisis emerging alongside the COVID-19 pandemic, the rich made a killing. According to the Institute for Policy Studies,</p>
<p class="block"><a id="page_112"/>Between March 18 and April 10, 2020, over 22 million people lost their jobs as the unemployment rate surged toward 15 percent. Over the same three weeks, U.S. billionaire wealth increased by $282 billion, an almost 10 percent gain.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch05note17" id="ch05note17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">Yet despite their preposterous lifestyles, and the barbarity of the growing inequality between rich and poor, capitalists, too, are like gold-studded cogs in the wheels of the system. As Marx explained: “[C]ompetition subordinates every individual capitalist to the immanent laws of capitalist production, as external and coercive laws. It compels him to keep extending his capital, so as to preserve it, and he can only extend it by means of progressive accumulation.”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch05note18" id="ch05note18"><sup>18</sup></a> If Ford had contented himself with blowing the profits from the first series of Model Ts on a fancy vacation, rather than investing in new technologies, another company would have been first to innovate car production. Ford would have become a footnote in the history of US capitalism.</p>
<p class="indent">History is riddled with such footnotes of companies that fail to innovate and then go under. Consider Blockbuster, once a multibillion-dollar entertainment company, with over 9,000 stores and 60,000 employees. The company took a rather abrupt turn to uselessness and bankruptcy when it failed to stay ahead of streaming technologies. Blockbuster passed up an opportunity to buy a then-small company named Netflix for $50 million in 2000, unaware that most people would be watching their shows and movies through the internet before long. Netflix soon drove Blockbuster out of business.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch05note19" id="ch05note19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">This is why both Marc Bell and his Star Trek-styled mansion, and Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield, founders of Ben and Jerry’s “caring capitalism” icecream are all disciplined by the same forces of the market, and are all compelled to accumulate, or face bankruptcy. Marc and Ben and Jerry, whatever their personal feelings about capitalism or <em>Star Trek</em>, must make enough profit to plow back into further innovation and production. As Marx famously described:</p>
<p class="block">Accumulate, accumulate! That is Moses and the prophets! ‘Industry furnishes the material which saving accumulates.’ Therefore, save, save, <em>i.e.</em>, reconvert the greatest possible portion of surplus value or surplus-product into capital! Accumulation for the sake of accumulation, production for the sake of production: this was the formula in which classical economics expressed the historical mission of the bourgeoisie in the period of its domination. Not for one instant did it deceive itself over the nature of wealth’s birth-pangs.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch05note20" id="ch05note20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_113"/>We can see then that in reality M-C-M’ cannot be a linear process with a beginning and end, but a continuous one, which must spiral in growth. When the system is running smoothly, capitalists don’t sit on the cash they’ve made; profits are shoveled back into new rounds of production.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch05note21" id="ch05note21"><sup>21</sup></a> Cash from this quarter’s auto, health services, or iPhone sales is used to finance next year’s models. Each round of production thus proceeds from a more advanced position than the last, built on the larger amount of money—M’—generated by the previous cycle.</p>
<p class="fig_caption" id="fig6">FIGURE 6. ROUNDS OF PRODUCTION</p>
<p class="image"><img alt="image" src="../images/img121-01.jpg"/></p>
<p class="indent">The second round of production, M’-C’-M’’, now creates an even greater total. Instead of a $20,000 investment producing value of $30,000, we can now start with $30,000 and end up with $45,000. M-C-M’ is really: M-C-M’-C’-M’’-C’’-M’’’-C’’’-M’’’’ in perpetuity. As Marx wrote: “Looked at concretely, accumulation can be resolved into the production of capital on a progressively increasing scale. The cycle of simple reproduction alters its form and, to use Sismondi’s expression, changes into a spiral.”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch05note22" id="ch05note22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">This spiraling buildup of wealth brings us back to the definition of capital as the self-expansion of value.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch05note23" id="ch05note23"><sup>23</sup></a> On an individual basis, each capitalist is compelled to expand profits and investments or face insolvency. On a <em>system-wide</em> basis, this translates to an economy that must grow without bounds. As David Harvey explained: “Just read the press reports on the state of the economy every day, and what are people talking about all the time? Growth! Where’s the growth? How are we going to grow? Slow growth defines a recession, and negative growth a depression. One or 2 percent growth (compounded) is not enough, we need at least 3, and only when we reach 4 percent is the economy deemed to be ‘healthy.’”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch05note24" id="ch05note24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>

<div class="box3">
<p class="box-head"><a id="page_114"/>CAPITALISTS GROW OR DIE</p>
<p class="noindent">For capitalists to increase their market share they must lower prices. And in order to lower prices they need to invest in laborsaving, cost-cutting technologies, which will allow them to produce goods more cheaply than their competitors.</p>
<p class="indent">There may be some cases when a corporation may drop their prices, despite not lowering the cost of production, and thus take a temporary hit on their rate of profit for the sake of gaining greater market share. This may be a tempting strategy during periods of recession when markets are saturated with goods that no one is able to buy. A company that is able to lower their prices can force their competitors to pay the consequences of unsold products. Retail companies call this strategy being a “loss leader.” They sell a popular good or service below value in order to get people in the door. Then they hope to make up for it by selling other goods, or selling at a higher price once they drive their competitors out of the market.</p>
<p class="indent">In the early 2000s, while the United States was going through a mild recession, Dell Computers dealt with diminishing sales of personal computers by dropping their prices below the average selling value. Their strategy was to take a temporary loss to their profit margins in order to sell more computers and grab more market share at the expense of their competitors. Indeed, Dell was able to take advantage of the moment to rise from the number two PC maker in the US to number one and stay there for several years. But ultimately this strategy has to work in tandem with a longer-term strategy to reduce the cost of production. Lower profit margins are not sustainable for any corporation, particularly in the fast-changing computer industry. As soon as another PC maker invests in new laborsaving technology, they will be able to produce faster, better, and cheaper computers.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_115"/>Dell’s key strategy for years had been to lead the charge in developing lean, low-cost production processes. Since the 1990s, Dell used just-in-time manufacturing methods that rely on maintaining only days’ worth (and in some cases hours’ worth) of inventory, keeping warehouse and delivery costs low, and avoiding the risks and price tag involved with holding on to a backlog of computer parts. This method itself required the investment in extensive, web-based collaborative technologies, which could keep factory managers assessing their inventory by the hour to avoid stoppages in production.</p>
<p class="indent">To further reduce costs, Dell invested in their, then new, Topfer Manufacturing Center factory in Austin, Texas, where they increased production by a third while cutting manufacturing space in half. As <em>Forbes</em> described it: “Workers already scuttle about in the 200,000-square-foot plant like ants on a hot plate. Gathered in cramped six-person ‘cells,’ they assemble computers from batches of parts that arrive via a computer-directed conveyor system overhead… Workers in the six-person cells now assemble 18 units an hour, double the pace of a couple of years ago.”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch05note25" id="ch05note25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">In part, the drive toward increased productivity comes down to good old-fashioned methods of increasing the rate of exploitation. The teams of workers that fill each “cell” compete with each other to see which line can churn computers out the fastest. “In a blur of synchronized movements,” wrote Bill Breen for <em>Fast Company</em>, “a veteran builder can piece together a Dell… in three minutes.”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch05note26" id="ch05note26"><sup>26</sup></a> One story that made its rounds at Topfer factory was about a day that CEO and founder Michael Dell himself toured the factory. “A group from one of the packing lines showed him how they’d upped their processing rate from 300 to 350 boxes an hour,” Breen reports. “Michael congratulated them, and there were high fives all around… But then he issued a challenge: ‘How can we improve to 400?’”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch05note27" id="ch05note27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">And yet, notwithstanding Michael Dell’s implorations, workers can only be driven so far. Ultimately, it is investment in laborsaving technology that can make lasting and qualitative leaps in the speed of turnout. To be sure, the main focus of Dell executives reported “maniacal focus on shaving minutes off assembly time” was in reducing the time needed for “human intervention,” i.e. workers’ labor on the factory floor. Innovations in hydraulic tools, conveyor belts, tracks, and box-packing robots reportedly decreased the time that workers were involved in production by <em>half</em>.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_116"/>Ultimately, further innovations in the computer industry have rendered personal computers close to obsolete as laptops, tablets, and even smartphones replace their functions. Thus in 2008, in the midst of both a recession and a longterm decline of PCs, Dell’s much-touted Topfer plant was closed, showing its eight hundred fast and efficient workers the company’s gratitude with pink slips.</p>

<p class="h3">ONE CAPITALIST KILLS MANY</p>
<p class="noindent">Evidence abounds of capitalism’s fantastical growth, which has led to corporations of colossal size, along with the accumulation of vast wealth into few hands. In 2016, the world’s 500 largest companies generated nearly $30 trillion in revenues and $1.5 trillion in profits, employing 65 million people—more than twice the total workforce of France.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch05note28" id="ch05note28"><sup>28</sup></a> These 500 companies generated eight times the amount of revenue as Germany’s GDP, and twelve times the combined GDPs of the entire African continent. We noted earlier that Apple was the first company to cross the $1 trillion threshold of net worth. Compare that to the size of US Steel, the largest American corporation a hundred years ago, which was then valued at less than $50 billion (adjusted for inflation).<a href="19_bm006.html#ch05note29" id="ch05note29"><sup>29</sup></a> As we’ll see, the size of these corporate giants affords them all sorts of benefits, which increase their competitive edge. Large companies have tremendous power in determining pace, pricing, and the establishment of new markets for the industries that they dominate.</p>
<p class="indent">Marx identified two key dynamics involved in this scaling up of enterprises: concentration and centralization. <small>CONCENTRATION</small> of capital is the process of an enterprise growing through time, by way of accumulation—the spiraling circuit of capital previously illustrated. He explained:</p>
<p class="block">Every individual capital is a larger or smaller concentration of means of production, with a corresponding command over a larger or smaller army of workers. Every accumulation becomes the means of new accumulation. With the increasing mass of wealth which functions as capital, accumulation increases the concentration of that wealth in the hands of individual capitalists, and thereby widens the basis of production on a large scale and extends the specifically capitalist methods of production.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch05note30" id="ch05note30"><sup>30</sup></a></p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page_117"/>That is to say: each round of production leaves the capitalist with the ability to invest more in the next cycle. Concentration of capital is thus a historical process, as surplus value accrues over time. Bourgeois economists refer to concentration as “organic growth.” Of course, “organic” makes it sound very pleasant and benign! But as we’ve seen, growth is propelled through exploitation and the theft of our labor.</p>
<p class="indent">In Walmart’s first decade after opening its initial store in 1962, the chain averaged 3.5 US store openings per year. In its second decade the number jumped to 42.7 and in the third decade it averaged 129.4 yearly openings in the United States. In its fourth decade, openings in the US dropped to 91.6 stores per year (although by then it had started to open stores internationally as well). As a result, in forty-five years Walmart grew from a single store to a chain that had opened 3,176 stores in the United States and became the largest retailer in the world. See <a href="#fig7">Figure 7</a>.</p>

<p class="indent"><a id="page_118"/>Not coincidentally, Walmart workers earn an estimated 14.5 percent less than other low-paid retail workers. A full 15 percent of Walmart’s Ohio employees are on food stamps, and it should come as no surprise that studies have found that “the entry of Wal-Mart into a county reduces both average and aggregate earnings of retail workers and reduces the share of retail workers with health coverage on the job.”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch05note31" id="ch05note31"><sup>31</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">McDonald’s, for its part—which has fought tooth and nail against the Fight For $15 [dollars per hour wage] by spying on, threatening, and firing workers engaged in the campaign—grew by nearly 20 percent to 36,899 branches in the last ten years alone.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch05note32" id="ch05note32"><sup>32</sup></a> The chain closed more stores than it opened in 2015, for the first year since 1970 (and likely since it became a franchise in 1955). Apparently fast food chains that use more food-like ingredients have finally made a dent in the revenues of the world’s biggest burger chain. But its position as fast-food behemoth still remains unchallenged. Similar patterns can be observed among many of the corporate titans that dominate the economic landscape.</p>
<p class="indent">Such growth is accelerated by credit and financial structures, which provide a variety of mechanisms for capitalists to pool investments from financiers in order to advance a greater amount of capital, and accumulate further profits. The stock and bond markets, which we’ll discuss in chapter seven, are collectively called <small>CAPITAL MARKETS</small>. The sale of stock raises a large amount of cash from stakeholders, who then own fractions of the company and its future profits. Companies can also raise capital by selling bonds. The bonds are a form of debt, which can be issued at set interest rates for a certain number of years. Global capital markets are worth hundreds of trillions of dollars, and their rise has vastly accelerated the process of concentration under capitalism.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch05note33" id="ch05note33"><sup>33</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">The centralization of capital, meanwhile, is the process through which industries come to be dominated by fewer and larger enterprises through consolidation. Centralization “does not mean that simple concentration of the means of production and of the command over labor, which is identical with accumulation,” Marx explained. Rather:</p>
<p class="block">It is concentration of capitals <em>already formed</em>, destruction of their individual independence, expropriation of capitalist by capitalist, transformation of many small into few large capitals. This process differs from the first one in this respect, that it only presupposes a change in the distribution of already available and already functioning capital. Its field of action is therefore not limited by the absolute growth of social wealth, or in other words by the absolute limits of accumulation. Capital grows to a huge mass in a single hand in one place, because it has been lost by many in another place. This is centralization proper, as distinct from accumulation and concentration.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch05note34" id="ch05note34"><sup>34</sup></a> [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page_119"/>The end result is a further concentration of capital. But rather than coming about through the creation of new capital, already existing capital shifts hands through debts, mergers, acquisitions, and cutthroat competition. Companies that don’t make it face bankruptcy, and can then be bought up on the cheap by their more solvent rivals.</p>
<p class="indent">The history of the auto industry in the United States, for example, has seen hundreds of defunct competitors absorbed or put out of business throughout the years to arrive at an industry now dominated by the “big three” automakers.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch05note35" id="ch05note35"><sup>35</sup></a> Marx had this kind of story in mind when he wrote: “Capital can grow into powerful masses in a single hand in one place, because in other places it has been withdrawn from many individual hands.”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch05note36" id="ch05note36"><sup>36</sup></a> Or more simply: “One capitalist always kills many.”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch05note37" id="ch05note37"><sup>37</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">The same process is evident in newer industries, particularly the tech sector where start-ups rapidly pop up and then become absorbed by giants like Microsoft, Apple, and Google. Since the late 1980s, Microsoft has acquired more than two hundred small firms and amassed ownership stakes in sixty others. In the same time span, Apple acquired over one hundred.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch05note38" id="ch05note38"><sup>38</sup></a> These numbers do not include assets that Microsoft or Apple purchased from bankrupt firms. Property and technology are often sold well below market value, as companies gone bust need cash to satisfy debts and reorganize.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch05note39" id="ch05note39"><sup>39</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">Most dramatically and aggressively, Google transformed itself from a search engine to an online beast. Between 2001 and 2019, the firm completed more than two hundred acquisitions—mostly of small software firms. It now clocks in an average of one acquisition a week, and controls about three-quarters of the market for digital search ads. Acquisitions have been used or integrated into services such as Google Groups, Blogger, Picasa, Google Maps, the Android operating system, Google Docs, YouTube, and a myriad of other products, which puts Google at the center of almost anything you do online. Google is growing past its online home, too, to “driverless cars,” artificial intelligence, health care technologies, and other products.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch05note40" id="ch05note40"><sup>40</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">In 2013, Google bought Waze, the navigation app with real-time transportation information, for $1.1 billion. Was this a necessary technological innovation to Google Maps? In fact, they have yet to integrate most of Waze’s technology into Google Maps. More likely, as with many acquisitions, it has more to do with strategic positioning in the market. That is: make sure that you have no competitors who may pose a greater threat down the road.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_120"/>It is the same principal that spawns several Starbucks stores on one block. There used to be one block in downtown Manhattan where you could sit in one Starbucks, sip your macchiato, and look out at two more. How many more customers could Starbucks possibly hope to attract with three identical cafés facing each other on the same street? But after Starbucks bought out the competition of the smaller independent coffee shops, they eventually sold off that property to other investors. Starbucks would rather lose money on a redundant store than have people walking around town holding cups that advertise another coffee shop.</p>
<p class="indent">The number of mergers and acquisitions has hit a fever pitch in recent years. In 2018, companies announced approximately fifty thousand transactions with a total value of $3.8 trillion.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch05note41" id="ch05note41"><sup>41</sup></a> Both the number of mergers and acquisitions and their values have set records in the last few years.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch05note42" id="ch05note42"><sup>42</sup></a> “America’s already huge corporations are combining like nobody’s business,” Harold Meyerson wrote for the <em>American Prospect</em> and the <em>Washington Post</em>:</p>
<p class="block">In recent months, Walgreens bought Rite Aid, uniting two of the nation’s three largest drugstore chains; in beerland, Molson Coors is buying Miller; mega-health insurers Aetna and Anthem, respectively, bought mega-health insurers Humana and Cigna; Heinz bought Kraft, good news for those who take ketchup with their cheese; and American Airlines completed its absorption of US Airways, reducing the number of major US airlines to four, which now control 70 percent of the air travel market. On Wall Street, the five biggest commercial banks hold nearly half of the nation’s bank assets; in 1990, the five biggest held just 10 percent.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch05note43" id="ch05note43"><sup>43</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">As it does for the process of concentration, credit works as a powerful lever for centralization. First, as a means by which companies and other investors can pool capital. Second, companies often borrow massive amounts in order to buy out their competitors, or bring smaller firms into their folds. Such has recently been the case in China, where companies and investors feared slowing growth, leading to a surge of debt-fueled acquisitions in the quest for more revenue. Large companies with good banking relationships, explained the <em>Financial Times</em>, “can spend heavily overseas as a way to diversify away from their dwindling earnings at home.”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch05note44" id="ch05note44"><sup>44</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_121"/>As Marx wrote: “In its first stages, [the credit] system furtively creeps in as the humble assistant of accumulation, drawing into the hands of individual or associated capitalists by invisible threads the money resources, which lie scattered in larger or smaller amounts over the surface of society; but it soon becomes a new and terrible weapon in the battle of competition and is finally transformed into an enormous social mechanism for the centralization of capitals.”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch05note45" id="ch05note45"><sup>45</sup></a> Thus credit is first a tool for the simple concentration of capital, but is then wielded by those large companies that have greatest access to it as a means to bludgeon their weaker competitors.</p>
<p class="h3">SIZE MATTERS</p>
<p class="noindent">Concentration and centralization are not merely by-products of accumulation, or the “organic growth” of companies gaining compound profits. Centralization, aided by credit and financial structures, transforms the speed and scale at which the economic landscape is revolutionized in the “twinkling of an eye.” Marx’s eloquent description of this process is worth quoting at length:</p>
<p class="blocka">Centralization supplements the work of accumulation by enabling industrial capitalists to extend the scale of their operations. Whether this latter result is the consequence of accumulation or centralization, whether centralization is accomplished by the violent method of annexation—where certain capitals become such preponderant centers of attraction for others that they shatter the individual cohesion of the latter and then draw the separate fragments to themselves—or whether the fusion of a number of capitals already formed or in process of formation takes place by the smoother process of organizing joint-stock companies—the economic effect remains the same. Everywhere the increased scale of industrial establishments is the starting point for a more comprehensive organization of the collective labor of many people, for a broader development of their material motive forces, i.e., for the progressive transformation of isolated processes of production, carried on by customary methods, into socially combined and scientifically arranged processes of production.</p>
<p class="block1">But accumulation, the gradual increase of capital by reproduction as it passes from the circular to the spiral form, is clearly a very slow procedure compared with centralization, which needs only to change the quantitative groupings of the constituent parts of social capital. The world would still be without railways if it had had to wait until accumulation had got a few individual capitals far enough to be adequate for the construction of a railway. Centralization, however, accomplished this in the twinkling of an eye.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch05note46" id="ch05note46"><sup>46</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_122"/>What is more, both concentration and centralization feed back into the competitive struggle by creating further advantages for the corporations that most quickly succeed in gaining the largest size. Marx argued:</p>
<p class="block">The battle of competition is fought by the cheapening of commodities … and this depends in turn on the scale of production. Therefore, the larger capitals beat the smaller. It will further be remembered that, with the development of the capitalist mode of production, there is an increase in the minimum amount of individual capital necessary to carry on a business under its normal conditions… [Competition] ends in the ruin of many small capitalists, whose capitals partly pass into the hands of their conquerors, and partly vanish completely.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch05note47" id="ch05note47"><sup>47</sup></a></p>
<p class="noindent">Marx is making the point that large corporations can most easily cheapen the cost of production, and therefore the cost of goods. For this reason, the minimum capital for running a business at all increases over time.</p>
<p class="indent">There are several reasons why the size afforded to corporate giants allows them to put a great distance between themselves and their competitors. First, on a basic level, large numbers of workers are more efficient than individual or small groups of laborers. Organizing work collectively creates the advantage of simultaneous work. Whereas an individual craftsman would have to perform one task at a time, putting down her tools and picking up a new set in between each operation, setting herself to another piece of production, simultaneous work limits interruptions in the labor process. As Marx explained with one example, “Twelve masons, in their collective working day of 144 hours, make much more progress with the building than one mason could make working for 12 days, or 144 hours. The reason for this is that a body of men working together have hands and eyes both in front and behind, and can be said to be to a certain extent omnipresent. The various parts of the product come to fruition simultaneously.”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch05note48" id="ch05note48"><sup>48</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">In a factory setting, one of the best-known examples of the revolutionary impact of simultaneous work is that of automobile production. Cars, we saw, became popular consumer commodities once they could be mass-produced and therefore sold more cheaply. A single worker could build a car. It might take days or even weeks.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch05note49" id="ch05note49"><sup>49</sup></a> It could be done. But when work is collectivized, cars can be produced in minutes. Thus at the start of the twentieth century, auto production shifted away from a system in which a group of workmen overseen by a skilled craftsman built the automobile at a stationary site. Every piece of the car was brought in, welded, assembled, installed, painted, and so on. Needless to say, this was an incredibly time-consuming process. Each coat of paint took upwards of twelve hours to dry. A great deal of running back and forth to piece together the car was involved, so much so that in many cases several workers were dedicated exclusively to retrieving parts. And every person involved in assembling the car had to learn and remember dozens of tasks and every component part.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch05note50" id="ch05note50"><sup>50</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_123"/>Conveyer-based assembly lines and a tight division of labor changed the face of the auto industry. By 1920, 85 percent of autoworkers were unskilled or semiskilled workers, and within a few years, production time necessary to produce the Ford Model T went down from twelve hours per car to ninety minutes per car.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch05note51" id="ch05note51"><sup>51</sup></a> Cars were therefore much easier to produce in great numbers and low cost, and sales shot up from the thousands to the millions within a matter of years.</p>
<p class="indent">Along with collectivization of labor, the exploited workforce has to be effectively <em>supervised</em> for maximum efficiency. There’s no greater danger to efficiency than a large, alienated group of workers laboring together. Their interests naturally lead to sabotage, slowdowns, or—heaven forbid—organizing efforts! The market treats workers as individuals—necessary inputs for production—and, as was discussed in the previous chapter, reduces our mental and physical capabilities to their barest and most alienated forms. But once in the workplace, workers are thrown together into similar conditions and often in close enough proximity to each other that we can organize. As business historian Norman Gras wrote in <em>Industrial Evolution</em>: “It was purely for the purposes of discipline, so that the workers could be effectively controlled under the supervision of the foreman. Under one roof, or within a narrow compass, they could be started to work at sunrise and kept going till sunset, barring periods of rest and refreshment. And under penalty of loss of all employment they could be kept going almost all throughout the year.”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch05note52" id="ch05note52"><sup>52</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">Second, larger companies develop what mainstream economists call <small>ECONOMIES OF SCALE</small>—cost advantages gained through operational efficiencies and economic leverages. As output grows, the average cost of producing each unit falls. How does this work? Once a company pays for factory or office space, for storage, and for delivery and transportation costs, the difference between producing ten times the amount of goods does not result in ten times the cost in inputs, since the core expenses have already been paid for in the main.</p>
<p class="indent">An article in the <em>Economist</em> laid out the following example: “It might cost $3,000 to produce 100 copies of a magazine but only $4,000 to produce 1,000 copies. The average cost in this case has fallen from $30 to $4 a copy because the main elements of cost in producing a magazine (editorial and design) are unrelated to the number of magazines produced.”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch05note53" id="ch05note53"><sup>53</sup></a> Similarly, if you were to build a factory with ten times the productive capacity, the additional electric wiring and piping would not require a significant amount of additional labor or materials. Or if you were to ship one thousand books this would not be ten times more expensive as shipping one hundred, since the operating crew size for ships and planes does not increase in proportion to capacity. Some costs, like advertising, don’t increase at all no matter how many units of a good are being advertised. A billboard on the highway or an ad on the subway cost the same for a small or a large company.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_124"/>Costs also drop as production scales up because large technological investments are spread out over a greater number of units of output. A printing company must invest in high-grade printers for fast, high-quality printing. But a printing company that produces ten thousand pages a day will recoup the cost of these printers much more slowly than one that produces a million pages.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch05note54" id="ch05note54"><sup>54</sup></a> Other sources of cost efficiencies have to do with leverages that large companies have over smaller companies, including the ability to purchase raw materials in bulk or forcing distributors to sell goods more cheaply. Small firms depend on large corporations, but the reverse is not true. Walmart is notorious for ruthlessly driving down prices with its suppliers in its efforts to lower costs. But its distribution reach is unparalleled. Walmart’s more than sixty thousand suppliers have no choice but to play ball, even if it means minimal profits in return.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch05note55" id="ch05note55"><sup>55</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">A final aspect of economies of scale lies with corporate access to credit. Obtaining lower interest rates from banks and having the ability to utilize a range of financial instruments affords economic advantages. Bigger companies can more easily secure credit to drive investments and expansion, and then carry great amounts of debt for long periods of time, taking advantage of low interest rates. They can also circumvent banks altogether through bond markets. A paper from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York explained: “Small firms tend to rely more on credit obtained through intermediaries, such as banks, [incurring greater fees] while larger firms have more varied sources of financing, such as direct credit, including the issuance of equity, corporate bonds, and commercial paper.”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch05note56" id="ch05note56"><sup>56</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">Third, during periods of shrinking markets, large companies can more easily weather the storm, and even find “opportunities” to make gains at the expense of smaller, weaker companies going bust. They can carry a large debt load for longer periods of time and can keep the spigot of credit going through more diverse means, which allows large corporations to wait out a recession, and keep payroll and bills paid despite absorbing losses to profitability. This is why, as the <em>Financial Times</em> noted, the crisis of US oil companies between 2014 and 2016, brought about by a precipitous drop in prices, impacted some more than others. “Some companies, though, are more stressed than others. It is no coincidence that the four companies that sold bonds in the first quarter were some of the largest and most secure in the sector.”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch05note57" id="ch05note57"><sup>57</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_125"/>At the same time, big companies can afford to close down the least profitable wings of production and still keep money flowing. As Marx wrote: “The larger size of his capital compensates him for the smaller profits, and he can even bear temporary losses until the smaller capitalist is ruined and he finds himself freed from this competition. In this way, he accumulates the small capitalist’s profits.”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch05note58" id="ch05note58"><sup>58</sup></a> This plays out on an international scale, as big multinationals use their global reach to cushion the impact of recessions at their home bases, and “diversify” their investments to take advantage of any part of the global economy that is growing. McDonald’s and Starbucks, for instance, saw hundreds of closed stores and declining revenue in 2009, but rebounded largely based on strong sales outside the US.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch05note59" id="ch05note59"><sup>59</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">Large size will also afford these companies the option of offering customers discounts and bargains, securing whatever remains of a recession’s shrinking consumer base and driving smaller companies out of the market altogether. Finally, outsized companies can use their greater capital to buy up failed companies, or the excess equipment and goods that they leave behind, on the cheap. In this way, using a bargain-priced means of production, they can further lower their own production costs and increase their rates of profit. Thus capitalism’s crises often destroy smaller businesses and further strengthen larger players.</p>
<p class="indent">From a capitalist’s perspective, such efficiency is irresistible. Workplaces and even cities themselves are transformed through ever-greater concentration and centralization of wealth, producing the largest factories the world has ever known. (See sidebar: “Mega Capitalism.”) The largest among them, a Boeing assembly plant in Everett, Washington, sprawls over four million square feet, the size of about seventy football fields. Amazon’s distribution center also clocks in at over a not-too-shabby million square feet.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch05note60" id="ch05note60"><sup>60</sup></a> Here, fast moving conveyer belts and scuttling robots move products across a sci-fi-looking landscape, along with several hundred very unlucky employees, paid about $11 an hour, <em>if</em> they have full-time status. Amazon has been known to quietly get rid of injured workers at their warehouses, station ambulances outside their doors to treat heatstroked employees, and, in one case, even hire a neo-Nazi security firm at its German warehouse to watch and abuse the predominantly immigrant workforce there.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch05note61" id="ch05note61"><sup>61</sup></a></p>
<div class="box3">
<p class="box-head"><a id="page_126"/>MEGA CAPITALISM</p>
<p class="noindent">Alongside giant corporations, concentration and centralization have given rise to colossal cities. Global capitalism requires ever-greater numbers of workers living and laboring in dense urban areas. These conditions have given rise to urban explosions reminiscent of the enclosures and early birth pangs of capitalism. Rural peasants and workers driven from their land have continued to feed ongoing industrialization.</p>
<p class="indent">The majority of the world’s population now lives in urban areas, and are increasingly concentrated in very large cities.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch05note62" id="ch05note62"><sup>62</sup></a> United Nations projections to 2025 suggest that the future list of “megacities” (cities with populations of over ten million) will include a growth of African, Asian, and Latin American cities from Lima to Tianjin. The World Economic Forum reports: “In 1960, the only city in sub-Saharan Africa with a population of over 1 million people was Johannesburg. Ten years later, there were four. By 2010, that number had skyrocketed to 33 cities. It is estimated that by 2050, 70% of the world’s population will be living in urban areas.”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch05note63" id="ch05note63"><sup>63</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">Some of the most explosive of these urban eruptions can be found in China, where the number of people living in cities has nearly tripled between 1990 and 2018, adding approximately 527 million people to the ranks of the working class.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch05note64" id="ch05note64"><sup>64</sup></a> As of 2017, China is home to fifteen of the world’s forty-seven megacities.</p>
<p class="indent">Among the most widely known is Shenzhen, often referred to as “a city without history,” for its seemingly overnight conversion from a small fishing village of scarcely three thousand people to a city of approximately thirteen million and counting.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch05note65" id="ch05note65"><sup>65</sup></a> But Shenzhen does, of course, have a history. Its path to urbanization began in 1979 with economic “modernization policies” driven by Deng Xiaoping. The city was established as one of Deng’s “Special Economic Zones,” which functioned as experimental grounds for market capitalism, dubbed by the Chinese government in Orwellian doublespeak as “socialism with Chinese characteristics.”</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_127"/>It has since become one of the world’s largest cities, and among the leading manufacturing bases in the world. Its frenzied growth has created a demographic that is almost wholly made up of migrants. And the extreme density of its population has led to the sprouting of massive skyscraper apartment buildings and “urban villages,” where basketball courts are turned to night markets with food stalls, and parking garages function as elementary schools for unregistered children of migrants.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch05note66" id="ch05note66"><sup>66</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">Shenzhen is the epicenter of Apple’s production in China, and the site of one of the notorious Foxconn plants, which make iPhones, iPads, and other iGadgets. Apple employs almost half a million workers in Shenzhen, many of them living in the plant’s barracks in cramped rooms with triple-decked bunks. In 2010 the plant made national headlines after fourteen suicides took place within the year. Despite Steve Jobs’s assertion that the plant was “pretty nice” and “not a sweatshop,” a Fair Labor Association audit in 2012 found that employees typically work more than sixty hours a week and almost half had witnessed accidents at work. Other reports found incidences of child labor, guards beating workers, and new recruits drilled along military lines.</p>
<p class="indent">The British newspaper, <em>Daily Mail</em>, went undercover at Shenzhen’s Foxconn plant where they reported dystopian work conditions alongside disturbing suicide prevention practices. These include forcing all Foxconn employees to sign documents that they will not take their own lives, the installation of ten-foot-high wire fences on the roofs and fifteen-foot-wide nets at the base of all buildings, along with the enlistment of hundreds of monks and social workers to the plant. “Workers who fail to respond to the chanting monks or the entreaties of social workers,” reports the <em>Mail</em>, “are secretly shipped to Shenzhen Mental Health Centre, a private facility where there are several wards crammed with Foxconn employees.”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch05note67" id="ch05note67"><sup>67</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_128"/>Employees are kept under tight watch and fined for things such as having long nails or talking to coworkers. But their morale is surely lifted by the daily playing of the national anthem over the loudspeakers: “Arise, arise, arise, millions of hearts with one mind.” The public address system, explains the <em>Mail</em>, “relays propaganda, such as how many products have been made; how a new basketball court has been built for the workers; and why workers should ‘value efficiency every minute, every second.’” Workers meanwhile wear jackets bearing slogans such as: “Together everyone achieves more.”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch05note68" id="ch05note68"><sup>68</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">All the morale boosts in the world could not help Yan Li, twenty-seven, who collapsed and died from exhaustion. “Yan collapsed having worked continuously for 34 hours,” reported the <em>Mail</em>. “He was on the night shift for a month and had worked overtime every night, according to his wife. Speaking on condition of anonymity, one line manager told us that there is constant pressure among all workers. ‘We must meet the quota every day at the maximum quality,’ said the man. ‘There are several layers of management with the pressure coming from above.’”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch05note69" id="ch05note69"><sup>69</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">Nine hundred miles northwest of Shenzen, Chongqing City’s population grows by four thousand people each week. There, migration is largely driven by the displacement of people by the Three Gorges Dam, the largest infrastructure project in the world. “Some of these new residents took jobs at local manufacturing plants and moved into instant skyscrapers,” wrote blogger Alissa Walker, “as other residents continue to farm the land between them as they have for centuries… The building boom is unprecedented… Chongqing is home to some of the largest bridges in the world, the scale of which is needed simply to get the people from one side of the city to another.”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch05note70" id="ch05note70"><sup>70</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">Driving these developments is the international scramble to find low-wage “flexible” workers, such as those supplied by China’s huge rural population. He Pengyuan, a manager at a Beijing-based courier company, explained it simply to the <em>Financial Times.</em> Not one of the workers he supervises is actually from Beijing. “We had two people from Beijing last year but they quit; they couldn’t handle the workload,” he said. “People from the city are too soft and spoiled…. China’s rural labor force is a huge army that keeps advancing. They come to the cities and keep the cost of labor relatively low.”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch05note71" id="ch05note71"><sup>71</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_129"/>The <em>Financial Times</em> described the conditions underlying this profitability:</p>
<p class="block">The jobs come with a frightening human toll. Most couriers say they are grateful for a job in the city, but they describe long hours, months away from their families and hard labor in a city to which they will never properly belong. “I hope my son remembers who I am,” says Chen Bing, a ZTO courier who hails from neighboring Hebel province. He says he is only able to return home to his wife and child once every three months due to the workload… During peak time, work starts at 7 a.m., and doesn’t end until midnight.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch05note72" id="ch05note72"><sup>72</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">The despotic conditions of unregulated capital faced by ZTO couriers, Foxconn employees, just as those endured by undocumented workers in New York’s or Los Angeles’ garment districts,<a href="19_bm006.html#ch05note73" id="ch05note73"><sup>73</sup></a> recall the devastation of laborers described by Marx and Engels in the early stages of the Industrial Revolution:</p>
<p class="block">[W]ithin the capitalist system, all methods for raising the social productivity of labor are put into effect at the cost of the individual worker… they distort the worker into a fragment of a man, they degrade him to the level of an appendage of a machine, they destroy the actual content of his labor by turning it into a torment; they alienate for him the intellectual potentialities of the labor process in the same proportion as science is incorporated in it as an independent power; they deform the conditions under which he works, subject him during the labor process to a despotism the more hateful for its meanness; they transform his life-time into working-time, and drag his wife and child beneath the wheels of the juggernaut of capital.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch05note74" id="ch05note74"><sup>74</sup></a></p>

<p class="h3"><a id="page_130"/>COMPETITION AND MONOPOLY</p>
<p class="noindent">Though concentration and centralization are outcomes of the competitive struggle, they feed back into the process of accumulation to breed its opposite: monopolies. A monopoly is a lone company that dominates its market (for instance Saudi Aramco, the state-owned Saudi oil and gas company), and an oligopoly is a market dominated by a handful of companies (for instance Big Pharma or the auto industry). Pure monopolies are rare, but monopolistic tendencies and practices abound. As ever-larger companies use increased clout to drive out competitors, these processes transform a market of many competitive firms into one dominated by handfuls of powerful corporate behemoths, able to take advantage of their preeminent positions. In the words of journalist Matt Stoller:</p>
<p class="block">Giant companies are operating as “cartels,” engaging in illegal conspiracies among themselves to divide up their turf. As a result, they have been able to fix the price of almost everything in the economy: antibiotics and other life-saving medication, fees on credit card transactions, essential commodities like cell-phone batteries and electric cables and auto parts, the rates companies pay to exchange foreign currency, even the interest rates on the municipal bonds that cities and towns rely on to build schools and libraries and nursing homes. A single price-fixing scandal by the world’s largest banks—fixing the global interest rates known as LIBOR—involved more than <em>$500 trillion</em> in financial instruments.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch05note75" id="ch05note75"><sup>75</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">One of America’s earliest and most powerful monopolies, Standard Oil, dominated 90 percent of oil production in the United States in the early twentieth century. Standard Oil’s founder, John D. Rockefeller, utilized secret pacts to gain preferential shipping rates on American railroads, and bought up smaller companies at rock-bottom prices once they had been ruined by the uneven treatment. Standard Oil gained enough momentum to acquire fifty-three refineries, keeping the most efficient and closing down the rest. “Thanks to its new economies of scale,” explained <em>Money and Power</em> author Howard Means, “Standard Oil could cut the cost of refining oil by two-thirds, from 1.5 cents a gallon to .5 cents a gallon,” further fueling its soaring market share.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch05note76" id="ch05note76"><sup>76</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">Standard Oil would soon team up with General Motors and Firestone Tires to literally derail public transit systems in the United States. In the 1920s, electric trolleys were common in cities across the country, and only one in ten people owned cars. GM received funding from Standard Oil and others to buy National City Lines, a bus company, which—with this funding—came to control bus systems in forty-five cities. These busses were meant to eliminate the need for trolley tracks that had been embedded in the roads. Alfred Sloan, GM’s president at the time, said, “We’ve got 90 percent of the market out there that we can… turn into automobile users. If we can eliminate the rail alternatives, we will create a new market for our cars.”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch05note77" id="ch05note77"><sup>77</sup></a> Once the national bus company replaced rail, they would let the business run itself into the ground, and make way for individual cars.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_131"/>One of the most infamous modern-day monopolies is the biotech agricultural company Monsanto. The company specializes in environmentally toxic, genetically modified crops and seeds, and utilizes patents to dominate seed markets. In India, 95 percent of cottonseed is controlled by Monsanto, as Indian companies have been locked into joint ventures and licensing arrangements for the last couple of decades. Every patented seed is the “intellectual property” of Monsanto, entitling them to royalties, thereby raising the costs of seeds. Perhaps most shockingly, these patented seeds have come to include “gene use restriction technology”—seeds that will not produce viable offspring seeds. In this way farmers are forced into buying new seeds every year, rather than harvesting them out of the previous year’s crops. The swelling of Indian farmers’ debt—along with increasing farmer suicides—are a product of what Indian environmentalist and ecofeminist Vandana Shiva has dubbed Monsanto’s “seeds of suicide.”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch05note78" id="ch05note78"><sup>78</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">Monopolization clearly has a very distorting impact on the purportedly “free market” principles touted by mainstream economists and ideologues. As former Secretary of Labor Robert Reich put it, “those with the most economic power have been able to use it to alter… the rules of the market to meet their needs.”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch05note79" id="ch05note79"><sup>79</sup></a> The impulse to do so is not reserved for the ultra-greedy or malicious, but is simply an outgrowth of the so-called free market itself. This is why a 2014 Goldman Sachs report basked in what they called “dreams of oligopoly”:</p>
<p class="block">There is a natural pull toward consolidation among mature or maturing industries. An oligopolistic market structure can turn a cut-throat commodity industry into a highly profitable one. Oligopolistic markets are powerful because they simultaneously satisfy multiple critical components of sustainable competitive advantage—a smaller set of relevant peers faces lower competitive intensity, greater stickiness and pricing power with customers due to reduced choice, scale cost benefits including stronger leverage over suppliers, and higher barriers to new entrants all at once.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch05note80" id="ch05note80"><sup>80</sup></a></p>
<p class="noindent">Of course, “pricing power” is just a euphemism for price gouging. By limiting consumer choices, Goldman analysts gleefully explain, oligopolies have created conditions in which they can get away with almost anything (because, as consumers, we’re “stuck” to these limited choices). The inflation of prices way past the value of goods and services turns nearly every arena of our lives into a nightmare.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_132"/>The airline oligopoly—in which just four airlines control 80 percent of seats on airplanes—employs a strategy that can only be understood as “calculated misery,” as journalist Tim Wu dubbed it. This includes the practice of “dynamic pricing” where prices change in real time, as demand increases. By their own admission, they will charge as much as they can get away with, as much as customers are desperate enough to pay. The cynicism of this approach came to light after a deadly Amtrak train crash in 2015 drove many fearful train riders into the hands of the airline industry, who waited with $1,000-plus airline tickets for flights across the Northeast.</p>
<p class="indent">And this is to say nothing of the seemingly unending growth of extra fees that airlines have added for such privileges as bringing a bag along with you on your flight, the ability to choose a seat ahead of time, or to guarantee having a seat at all in the likely event that the airline overbooks. (This is a lesson David Dao found out the hard way one day when he was dragged off his United Airlines flight, bloodied, kicking and screaming, for refusing to give up his paid-for seat.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch05note81" id="ch05note81"><sup>81</sup></a>) Ostensibly, many of these fees were added to help airlines contend with higher fuel prices, but when the price of oil tanked, the extra fees remained, while the airlines quietly pocketed billions of dollars in fees. Soon we’ll be asked to pay for cushions on our chairs and the right to use oxygen masks.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch05note82" id="ch05note82"><sup>82</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">Among the most devastating effects of price gouging is the impact that it has on our medications. The pharmaceutical companies—or, Big Pharma—are largely to blame. According to the World Health Organization, “The global pharmaceuticals market is worth $300 billion a year, a figure expected to rise to $400 billion within three years. The 10 largest drugs companies control more than one-third of this market, several with sales of more than US$10 billion a year and profit margins of about 30%.”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch05note83" id="ch05note83"><sup>83</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">The biggest of Big Pharma—Johnson &amp; Johnson, Pfizer, Merck &amp; Co., and others—are certainly responsible for skyrocketing pharmaceutical costs, as well as a growing epidemic of addictions to pain medication and psychiatric drugs.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch05note84" id="ch05note84"><sup>84</sup></a> But “small pharma,” too, including many of the ones charged with producing ostensibly cheaper “generic” drugs, have gotten in on the game by creating monopoly conditions through acquisitions and patent manipulations. Companies find a drug for which there is little market competition, buy out the firm that produces it, and immediately raise the prices. In this way, even smaller companies can mimic monopolistic strategies by cornering markets for particular drugs.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_133"/>This was exactly what Martin Shkreli and Turing Pharmaceuticals did in acquiring and then jacking up by 5,000 percent the price of Daraprim. As <em>Business Insider</em> pointed out, “For drugs like Daraprim, for which only about 8,000 prescriptions are filled a year, it simply isn’t worth it for other companies to try to come up with generic alternatives. This allows for a price monopoly in which the drug manufacturer can set virtually any price it wants.”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch05note85" id="ch05note85"><sup>85</sup></a> Thus the price of one Daraprim tablet—used mostly by HIV/AIDS and cancer patients to battle parasitic infections—shot up overnight from $13.50 to $750. Shkreli defended the move on the same grounds that many pharma executives and apologists do, saying the superprofits are necessary to fund further research and development. This is a patent lie. Pharmaceutical companies spend, at most, 15–20 percent of their revenues on research and development. And those companies that have most aggressively pursued the acquisition and price-hike game spend much less.</p>
<p class="indent">Take Valeant Pharmaceuticals, which until recently was considered a “star performer” among companies of its size. Valeant’s “business model” is to use colossal amounts of debt to fund a string of acquisitions. “After an acquisition,” explained the <em>Financial Times</em>, “Valeant usually lifts prices and slashes research and development.” The company spends a mere 3 percent of its revenues on developing new drugs. Meanwhile, in 2015 alone, it raised prices for fifty-six drugs (that’s 81 percent of its portfolio) totaling a 66 percent price rise overall. And so, for instance, Borna Heyman’s out-of-pocket expenses for battling Wilson’s disease, reported the <em>Financial Times</em>, went from $510 a year in 2010, to $12,000 a year in 2014.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch05note86" id="ch05note86"><sup>86</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">This is the irony of the ideology of the “free market.” Corporations gain in size, or corner a market, precisely so that they <em>don’t</em> have to compete to make the best or most affordable product. In the US, monopolistic activities are further entrenched by patent laws, which allow drug manufacturers to remain the sole makers of patented drugs for twenty years (and can easily game the patent system to extend past this point). Both Democrats and Republicans have maintained a system in which the government has no ability to negotiate or regulate the price of drugs. As Peter Bach, director of Memorial Sloan Kettering’s Center for Health Policy and Outcomes, explained, pharmaceutical companies charge high prices simply “because they can. We have no rational system in the US for managing prices of drugs.”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch05note87" id="ch05note87"><sup>87</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_134"/>Many other countries around the world—both rich and poor—have practices in place that help to keep prices of medicines down. The United Kingdom’s National Health Service, for instance, negotiates nationwide drug prices. By negotiating on behalf of the entire country, they exert “bulk buying power.” If pharmaceuticals were to charge too high a price, they would simply be left off the nation’s formulary.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch05note88" id="ch05note88"><sup>88</sup></a> American insurance plans and hospitals (not that we should pity them either!) are each obliged to pay whatever prices are set in an unregulated market. Even Medicare, which covers over forty million people, is legislatively barred from negotiating drug prices. Instead, we pay whatever the drug companies ask for, and pray that the “invisible hand” of the market leads to more competitive prices. The system’s ideologues promise us that the free market will deliver an efficient health-care system, just as it will peace on earth and a greener world. Yet the workings of the market lead to the exact opposite: the tyranny of corporate behemoths at the expense of all living things. (See sidebar: “Can the ‘Free Market’ Save the Planet?”)</p>
<p class="indent">The state plays its part, too, in shielding monopolistic companies deemed “too big to fail” from the ravages of a competitive, “free” market. After the 2008 economic crisis, as we’ll see in chapter seven, megabanks in the United States, each holding billions of dollars’ worth of assets, were rescued with an enormous taxpayer-funded bailout. As Petrino DiLeo explained: “The Treasury Department and Federal Reserve Bank have doled out an incredible $16 trillion in assistance to financial institutions and corporations in the US and around the world … Through the various mechanisms, Citigroup borrowed $2.5 trillion, Morgan Stanley took $2 trillion, Merrill Lynch received $1.9 trillion, and Bank of America got $1.3 trillion.”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch05note89" id="ch05note89"><sup>89</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">Once a company or a financial institution is so big, it is not just the sheer size of its collapse that poses a problem. Massive corporations are deeply interconnected with a vast web of industrial, service, and financial institutions, such that the collapse of one mega-institution threatens the stability of the whole system. Bankruptcies, ostensibly part of the free market’s ability to regulate and weed out inefficiencies, pose too great a risk. Take China’s “zombie” companies (so-called for logging in at least three years’ worth of losses). They collectively hold over a trillion dollars in debt. If they are allowed to go bust, the financial sector will go into shock. And this is to say nothing of the impact that several million laid-off steel and coal workers will have on the rest of the economy.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_135"/>Thus both the incentive to innovate and the penalty for abuse are ruled out, leaving even the ruling-class mouthpiece, the <em>Financial Times</em>, to complain:</p>
<p class="block">The problem of ‘too big to fail’ has made society—more precisely, the taxpayer—hostage to the survival of individual financial institutions… The rules of the game should be clear. Those who succeed are free to take the profits (after taxation); those who make losses have to bear the consequences, with bankruptcy as the ultimate sanction. Thus ‘too big to fail’ not only undermines a fundamental principle of market economies but also a principle of societies in which individuals are responsible for their actions.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch05note90" id="ch05note90"><sup>90</sup></a></p>
<p class="noindent">But what the likes of the <em>Financial Times</em> will not admit is that the tendency for “too big” companies is not an aberration, but the result of market fundamentals functioning as they should through the processes of concentration and centralization.</p>
<p class="indent">Of course, capitalism still maintains its dynamism through the constant jostling for market positioning by large and small companies. In some cases, a newer business, not so deeply entrenched in outmoded methods, could come out ahead. Thus a dozen years ago Bill Ford (of that “family-owned business,” Ford Motor Company) could say of the new auto company, Tesla, that it had little chance of staying alive. As the <em>Financial Times</em> explained, Ford assumed that “the complexity of the global supply chain and international regulation requirements made it all but impossible to launch an important new carmaker from scratch.”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch05note91" id="ch05note91"><sup>91</sup></a> A decade later, the “Big Three” American automakers are mired in over-supplied markets and old technologies. It is yet to be determined what kind of long-term success Tesla will fare, but no doubt, the established auto industry is nervous. Other “disruptive” companies exist in every field, from Uber and Airbnb, to internet-based homecare agencies and furniture stores that challenge the dominance of conventional brick and mortar enterprises.</p>
<p class="indent">If this were not the case, we would see the economy increasingly dominated by fewer and fewer companies, until one day we found ourselves with a single McGoogleAzon Corporation that ran everything from our dishwashers to our morning commutes. Instead, competition continues, but within a context of ever-greater economic players, which make the shifts, rivalries, and bankruptcies all the more volatile. As Russian revolutionary V.I. Lenin wrote, “At the same time monopoly, which has grown out of free competition, does not abolish the latter, but exists over it and alongside of it, and thereby gives rise to a number of very acute, intense antagonisms, friction and conflicts.”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch05note92" id="ch05note92"><sup>92</sup></a></p>
<p class="h3"><a id="page_136"/>IMPERIALISM: THE HIGHEST STAGE OF CAPITALISM</p>
<p class="noindent">A final point about the implications of concentration and centralization can only be briefly touched on here. Lenin and fellow revolutionary Nikolai Bukharin argued that the concentration and centralization of capital had developed to such a point that large monopolies are able to wield great economic and political control within their states of origin.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch05note93" id="ch05note93"><sup>93</sup></a> So much so, they noted, that the interests (and in many cases the institutions) of capital and the state become fused. States, in turn, come to play an increasingly active role in managing the long-term corporate interests of its national ruling class, both at home and abroad.</p>
<p class="indent">It’s easy to see the many ways that national governments look out for corporate interests through economic means. The US government, for instance, heavily subsidizes the grains and oil-seed companies through supplements to agribusinesses if prices fall below a certain limit. Loan programs also commit taxpayer dollars to financing and underwriting corporate debt if prices drop. In this way US companies can have a leg up, relative to other global competitors. Monsanto’s seeds of suicide, for instance, dominate international markets in large part because the company uses farm subsidies to undercut the prices of their competitors. The company has received over $1 billion in federal loans since 2000, along with millions of dollars in grants and subsidies.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch05note94" id="ch05note94"><sup>94</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">The Chinese government, for its part, took a different tack in responding to a global steel glut in 2016. They vowed to aggressively restructure their steel industry by drawing back lending to inefficient mills, and at the same time safeguard the country’s large “national champions.” Smaller and less profitable companies without extra financing would thus be pushed out of an oversupplied market. Meanwhile the government would prop up its larger firms and make them more efficient and competitive with the rest of the world’s steel producers, also struggling with a glut of supply and dropping prices.</p>
<p class="indent">Internationally, each state will go to bat for its corporate base at home with trade agreements, political maneuvering, and—when necessary—the threat of military force. As free market hack Thomas Friedman once declared: “The hidden hand of the market will never work without a hidden fist.”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch05note95" id="ch05note95"><sup>95</sup></a> Greater and smaller tensions play out daily across the globe: whether the United States Treasury Secretary warns that he would “deter US investment in Europe” following a European Union (EU) tax-evasion claim against Apple, or the EU imposes import duties on Chinese steel. Trade wars across the globe position states to line up behind their respective business classes. The line between economic and military tensions can be thin. Thus trade wars between the United States and China around steel and aluminum tariffs or patent laws go hand-in-hand with low-grade military disputes over naval control in the South China Sea, rich in oil reserves and important waterways. Of course, this line has grown thinner and thinner under the Trump presidency, which has ramped up China bashing in both word and deed, and led to an increase of anti-Asian racism in this country.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_137"/>At the same time that monopolies become increasingly wedded to the protection that their home states afford, the mass scale of production necessitates the breaking down of national boundaries for trade and investment. As Marx and Engels wrote: “The need of a constantly expanding market for its products chases the bourgeoisie over the whole surface of the globe. It must nestle everywhere, settle everywhere, establish connections everywhere.”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch05note96" id="ch05note96"><sup>96</sup></a> Corporations are thus just as dependent on their states to beat down barriers to foreign markets as they are on governments creating a corporate-friendly environment at home. States help capital access markets, financing, and production across borders in an increasingly globalized economy.</p>
<p class="indent">National competition therefore spills over into international, geopolitical competition. Both of these tendencies—melded interests with the state, and a need for access to international production and markets—lead to military rivalries for territory and power.</p>
<div class="box3">
<p class="box-head"><strong>SOCIALISM AND GROWTH?</strong></p>
<p class="noindent">Marx and Engels have been widely misinterpreted on the question of growth. They did celebrate the productive capacity of capitalism and saw it as laying the basis for a world of abundance that could make socialism possible. One famous passage from the <em>Communist Manifesto</em> reads:</p>
<p class="block"><a id="page_138"/>The bourgeoisie, during its rule of scarce one hundred years, has created more massive and more colossal productive forces than have all preceding generations together. Subjugation of nature’s forces to man, machinery, application of chemistry to industry and agriculture, steam navigation, railways, electric telegraphs, clearing of whole continents for cultivation, canalization of rivers, whole populations conjured out of the ground—what earlier century had even a presentiment that such productive forces slumbered in the lap of social labor?<a href="19_bm006.html#ch05note97" id="ch05note97"><sup>97</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">But Marx and Engels’s seeming appreciation of the productive forces of capital had more to do with the future possibilities embedded within them, and nothing to do with the destructive manner in which they currently manifest. The subjugation of nature to man, they noted in many of their writings, has deadly effects, not just to the natural world around us, but to humankind, which is itself a part of nature. As Engels wrote: “Thus at every step we are reminded that we by no means rule over nature like a conqueror over a foreign people, like someone standing outside nature—but that we, with flesh, blood and brain, belong to nature, and exist in its midst, and that all our mastery of it consists in the fact that we have the advantage over all other creatures of being able to learn its laws and apply them correctly.”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch05note98" id="ch05note98"><sup>98</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">Marx and Engels were very much <em>against</em> the destruction and degradation wrought by capitalism’s endless growth of commodities. At the same time, they understood that these same forces have created the conditions for a new society. “The development of the productive forces of social labor is capital’s historic mission and justification,” they wrote. “For that very reason, it unwittingly creates the material conditions for a higher form of production.”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch05note99" id="ch05note99"><sup>99</sup></a> Socialism would advance the development of society’s productive capacity. But the production of use-values that do not have <em>exchange-values</em> would lead to a very different dynamic.</p>
<p class="indent">Rather than the compulsion to produce more and more stuff in order to accumulate more and more profits, the purpose of production in a socialist society would be use, rather than profit. Human need would therefore drive decision-making, and would compel advances in technology and research for more efficient and sustainable production. Capital relies on “planned obsolescence” of goods made with nondurable and shoddy materials, or “upgrades” in designs, which render our expensive technology useless within a year or two. This is one of the many ways that we are continually induced to buy more. Socialized production, on the other hand, would allow us to develop methods that produce durable and ecologically sustainable goods. Simultaneously, we could cut necessary labor-power to <em>increase</em> our free time and unleash the creative potential of human beings unencumbered by dreadfully long work weeks.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_139"/>Many things can and should stop being produced immediately—like military arms, and advertisements. Others ought to be drastically reduced as quickly as possible, including cars and plastics. A socialist society would therefore need to tackle planning a system of public transportation that ends the need for cars. Beyond that, a future society will have to take up complex questions in facilitating the satisfaction of human need without destroying the earth that we live on. For instance, how do we want to organize food production? Research indicates that multi-crop, rotating agriculture, which is significantly more sustainable for the soil, can also produce more crops than the common methods of corporate farming.</p>
<p class="indent">Discussion of a future socialist society is beyond the scope of this book, but the key point to emphasize here is that capitalism forces us into a spiral of accumulation for the sake of accumulation. Planned development to improve the quality of life for the vast majority of humanity on the basis of sustainable production and planning is its polar opposite. That is the vision of a socialist society. From there, wrote Marx, “the private property of particular individuals in the earth will appear just as absurd as the private property of one man in other men. Even an entire society, a nation, or all simultaneously existing societies taken together, are not owners of the earth. They are simply its possessors, its beneficiaries, and have to bequeath it in an improved state to succeeding generations, as <em>boni patres familias</em> [good heads of the household].”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch05note100" id="ch05note100"><sup>100</sup></a></p>

<p class="h3"><a id="page_140"/>CONCLUSION</p>
<p class="noindent">Competition forces the capitalist class to constantly transform and advance the forces of production. “All that is solid melts into air,” Marx and Engels had written. In one sense they recognized that ever-revolutionizing the means of production creates possibilities that could not have been imagined centuries, or in some cases years earlier. But Marx and Engels argued that great contradictions are embedded within these “advances”: the immiseration of the working class, the destruction of the land, the concentration of greater wealth and power into fewer hands. (See sidebar: “Socialism and Growth?”) The ideologues of capitalism never tire of celebrating the so-called “invisible hand” of the market and its supposed ability to determine how to allocate social resources. Yet rather than a “free market” of unadulterated competition, we’ve seen that competition also leads to its opposite in the form of monopolies and companies that are “too big to fail.”</p>
<p class="indent">In the next chapter we will delve further into the contradictions of capital accumulation. Contradictions that not only undermine human and social need, but ultimately the system’s profitability. Even by capitalism’s own terms, the system periodically breaks down and fails. The very same forces that drive its vitality—competition, the pursuit of surplus value, and the continual expansion of production—also erect barriers to its ability to effectively function.</p>
<div class="box3">
<p class="box-head">CAN THE “FREE MARKET” SAVE THE PLANET?</p>
<p class="noindent">“The market knows best.” Competition, we’re told, will bring us a more “sustainable capitalism.” We’re expected to believe this despite the fact that the drive towards accumulation and the domination of corporate giants has ensured that aggressive, unrestrained cost cutting has brought us to the brink of planetary annihilation. The free market ideology of “green capitalism” rests on two main arguments. One—demand, which is increasingly driven by more environmental consciousness, will create a supply of clean technologies and products. And two—the market can be “incentivized” to compel corporations to do the right thing.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_141"/>So, for example, if consumers of cars want to live in a breathable world, they will create a demand for fuel-efficient, clean-emissions, and electric cars. The greater demand will then drive production toward these technologies, and those automakers who are ahead of the curve in upgrading will be the first to corner this new market. In one sense, something like this does happen. The market for “environmentally friendly cars” is getting bigger. Toyota’s fuel-efficient Prius competes with Chevrolet’s electric Volt, while Tesla’s electric cars made a flashy entrance into the market. But there are gaping holes in this philosophy.</p>
<p class="indent">First, consumers don’t drive production, profits do. Whatever makes the quickest buck will either be deployed to <em>create</em> a market, or to <em>manipulate</em> an existing need.</p>
<p class="indent">The shameless flagrancy of the corporate elite did not have a “cleaner” face than Volkswagen, who promised that their “clean diesel” cars emit 90 percent fewer emissions than standard diesel. Their ads declared: “Green has never felt so good!” and compared driving their “clean diesel” cars to riding a bicycle. But Volkswagen was compelled first and foremost to cut corners in producing its “clean diesel” cars, and they found it cheapest to install software that could cheat emissions tests, which would reduce emissions only during an inspection! The cars would otherwise emit forty times the allowable amount. Perhaps they meant that <em>other</em> green. Their profits have never felt so good.</p>
<p class="indent">Diesel emissions cause severe respiratory problems, leading, according to the <em>Financial Times</em>, to approximately fifty-two thousand premature deaths in the United Kingdom every year.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch05note101" id="ch05note101"><sup>101</sup></a> But more important for VW and other car manufacturers is that the cost of using emissions reducing technology averages to about $1500 or more per car. Skirting these costs, and hoping to get away with it, is much cheaper. Why produce diesel cars to begin with? The production capacity has long been invested in. To walk away from it would be to throw away billions of dollars.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_142"/>Second, as Volkswagen’s “Green has never felt so good” ads have proven, the concept of “green” or “sustainable” or “clean” technology is completely robbed of any real meaning in order to generate revenues, and fast. The same can be said of “organic” foods, and other consumer-placating concepts, around which massively profitable industries have arisen. Even in a best-case scenario, where customers aren’t downright cheated and lied to, the confines of the debate regarding these “solutions” are so narrow that they will never confront the scale of the crisis. How low have we sunk that only certain foods are labeled “organic” in the first place? And why are we producing greater numbers and more varieties of cars instead of investing in public transportation and infrastructure? The profiteering of auto companies is the first priority. Our public health needs and the long-term viability of the planet are not in the ranking. This brings us back to our basic framework: Capitalism is not designed to meet human need; it is designed to generate profit. This means not only robbing workers of our humanity and life, but also the soil, the air, the planet.</p>
<p class="indent">What then about the strategy to incentivize corporations to be more environmentally sustainable? Here the assumption is that even if the drive to accumulate is at odds with ecological considerations, we can at least exploit capitalists’ interests to our (and the planet’s) benefit. The best-known example of this is cap and trade, touted by mainstream environmental groups such as the Environmental Defense Fund, The Nature Conservancy, Audubon, and others. Cap and trade is an emissions trading system which first caps the maximum amount of emissions allowable for each corporate entity, and then authorizes companies that are polluting above the quota to buy “credits” for greater emissions from those companies that are “under-polluting,” so to speak. In this way, the theory goes, it would be more profitable to reduce emissions below the quota and generate income by selling credits on the cap and trade market. And it would cost polluting companies more money to have to buy pollution-enabling credits.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_143"/>There are many problems with this scheme. The first is, again, scale. If we are to reduce carbon levels in the atmosphere to 350 parts per million that scientists agree is necessary for our survival, the United States, for one, will have to reduce our carbon emissions by 80 percent. This requires a tremendous shift in the whole way our economy runs. Our factories, cars, and major transportation of goods via ships and trucks run on carbon-emitting gases. Providing extra incentive to chip away at the emissions of these same toxic entities is a distraction comparable to rearranging the deck chairs of the Titanic.</p>
<p class="indent">The other problem is that the large companies that dominate our economy can afford to buy extra credits in order to continue business as usual. Why are they given the option to buy their way out of capped emissions? The Clean Air Act, passed in 1963, long ago defined carbon as a pollutant that can be regulated by the state. Yet the government continues to subsidize the politically connected fuel industry at twice the rate of renewables. Lastly, these programs, which are written by the likes of ex-Enron executives and bankers at Goldman Sachs, are set up to benefit businesses and financial institutions. Thus countless loopholes for free permit giveaways and easy-to-access credits for companies that barely have to show emissions reductions only act to incentivize cheating the system.</p>
<p class="indent">Most importantly, both consumerism and market incentives fly in the face of the need to <em>regulate</em> corporations, whose interests are fundamentally at odds with ecological, health, and workplace demands. If we understand that capitalists are driven through mutual competition toward frenzied accumulation and the maximization of profits, then we know that capitalists do not have any interest in slowing down their own production with cleaner and less-hazardous methods, any more so than they have an interest in raising their workers’ living standards and sharing out profits. The “market cures all” mantra is a way to counter any steps toward regulation.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_144"/>The American Petroleum Institute, for its part, jumped to claim that emissions are already dropping due to the introduction of new technologies, and therefore government intervention is not necessary. And yet they gave lie to this claim when they <em>also</em> argued that any new regulations “could put the shale revolution at risk,” by raising costs and diverting investment from further production.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch05note102" id="ch05note102"><sup>102</sup></a> Cost is the real concern, not an interference with the “natural” process of gradually decreasing emissions.</p>
<p class="indent">In reality, capitalism views the earth merely as a source of raw materials and a sinkhole for dumping waste. As Marx put it, under capitalism, “nature becomes purely an object for humankind, purely a matter of utility; ceases to be recognized as a power for itself; the theoretical discovery of its autonomous laws appears merely as a ruse so as to subjugate it under human needs, whether as an object of consumption or as a means of production.”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch05note103" id="ch05note103"><sup>103</sup></a> Capitalists must think only of short-term profits in the scramble to stay ahead of competitors, and not the long-term impacts of their actions.</p>
<p class="indent">We can see how this plays out all too clearly in relation to the life-or-death issue of global warming. After decades of hand-wringing, the major world powers cannot produce a climate change agreement with any bite. Is it incompetence or a lack of scientific evidence? Neither. No country can risk restraining the toxic emissions of its own domestic capitalists, while other nations continue to push ahead and make quicker, dirtier profits. Capitalists, and their representatives in government, never forgo short-term economic benefits, because to do so would mean falling behind in the unceasing race to produce more for less.</p>
<p class="indent">As climate activist Chris Williams explained, for over two decades, no agreement “has been reached that would move the world toward the 80 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions that many scientists believe is necessary to avoid destabilizing the planetary climate system. Instead, atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide, the most common greenhouse gas, have increased every year and recently surpassed thresholds not seen since three million years ago.”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch05note104" id="ch05note104"><sup>104</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_145"/>The reason that governments around the world obstruct emissions agreements is not only to provide a short-term favor to the corporate elite, but also for broader geopolitical gain. Think of the benefits to the US ruling class of the climate-crushing “shale revolution,” which utilizes “extreme extraction” techniques to extract oil from previously unyielding shale rocks. The US now plays a dominant role in the international energy market; the American elite is no longer beholden to Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), or politically hostile nations like Venezuela. The greater their share of the market, the greater their control of production pacing and prices. This dramatic geopolitical turn has made for a devastating blow to the planet.</p>
<p class="indent">Finally, the requirement for ever-greater material and energy in order to keep expanding production puts capitalism profoundly and irrevocably at odds with a sustainable planet. According to a study by the National Academy of Sciences, the world economy exceeded the earth’s regenerative capacity in 1980, by 1999 had gone beyond it by as much as 20 percent, and by 2009 the gap had grown to 30 percent.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch05note105" id="ch05note105"><sup>105</sup></a> No country, government, or corporation can opt out of growth, and therefore cannot afford to opt out of exploiting the cheapest possible energy sources.</p>
<p class="indent">Bolivia’s Evo Morales, a former coca farmer and union organizer, and the country’s first indigenous president, came to power in 2006 following a wave of struggles against foreign extraction of resources, privatization, and economic polarization. His continued popularity has largely hung on his ability to bring more people out of poverty than has been achieved anywhere else in the region. But economic growth within the capitalist model cannot come without grave environmental costs, particularly in developing nations, whose economies have long been impeded by exploitative and colonial abuses from the US and other superpowers.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_146"/>And so despite the fact that Morales has put forward radical critiques of capitalism and climate change, “the establishment of government programs to alleviate poverty,” wrote Chris Williams and Marcella Olivera, have rested “on an expanded and intensified exploitation of the country’s natural resources, principally from fossil fuel production, mining, and the growth of large-scale, mono-crop agriculture and manufacturing.”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch05note106" id="ch05note106"><sup>106</sup></a> Morales’s government has opened seven of Bolivia’s twenty-two protected areas for hydrocarbon exploration. And mining exports have quadrupled from $1 billion in 2006 to $4 billion in 2014.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch05note107" id="ch05note107"><sup>107</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">Bolivia’s extractive strategy is largely responsible for the drying up of Lake Poopó, which in 1986 was a vast lake of 3100 square kilometers, and today “has shrunk to 5 square km, leaving just a few puddles on a cracked lake bed pockmarked by dead <em>vicunas</em> and abandoned fishing boats.” About half of the 750 Uru-Munto familes that depended on the lake for their sustenance have had to migrate to the cities looking for work. “There used to be plenty of water that provided us with everything we water people could possibly need,” explained Felix Condori, mayor of the Uro-Munto village Llapallapani. “Now there is no food to eat; the water is gone so the fish and birds are gone. That’s why our people are leaving and we face extinction.”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch05note108" id="ch05note108"><sup>108</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">Marx and Engels seem to have predicted today’s world when they wrote: “Modern bourgeois society, with its relations of production, of exchange and of property, a society that has conjured up such gigantic means of production and of exchange, is like the sorcerer who is no longer able to control the powers of the nether world whom he has called up by his spells.”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch05note109" id="ch05note109"><sup>109</sup></a></p>
