<p class="chap_title"><strong>THE LABOR THEORY OF VALUE</strong></p>
<p class="block">A commodity appears at first sight an extremely obvious, trivial thing. But its analysis brings out that it is a very strange thing, abounding in metaphysical subtleties and theological niceties… It is absolutely clear that, by his activity, man changes the forms of the materials of nature in such a way as to make them useful to him. The form of wood, for instance, is altered if a table is made out of it. Nevertheless the table continues to be wood, an ordinary, sensuous thing. But as soon as it emerges as a commodity [sold on the market], it changes into a thing which transcends sensuousness. It not only stands with its feet on the ground, but, in relation to all other commodities, it stands on its head, and evolves out of its wooden brain grotesque ideas, far more wonderful than if it were to begin dancing of its own free will.</p>

<p class="h3">THE CELLULAR STRUCTURE OF CAPITALISM</p>
<p class="noindent">The opening line of Karl Marx’s <em>Capital</em> is: “The wealth of societies in which the capitalist mode of production prevails appears as an ‘immense collection of commodities’; the individual commodity appears as its elementary form.”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch02note2" id="ch02note2"><sup>2</sup></a> It may sound prescient of late-stage capitalism’s hoarding disorders. But even in Marx’s day, as capitalism was developing and growing in pockets of Western Europe, the world was already overflowing with “commodities”—goods for sale on the market. Marx began his study of capitalism by examining commodities, which he saw as its building blocks. In this chapter we’ll investigate these blocks, and through their examination, work through the Marxist understanding of <em>value</em> and the role of labor.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_28"/>At first glance, a commodity appears to be simple enough. We are surrounded daily by hundreds of thousands of commodities all about us. From the food that we buy at the grocery store, to knickknacks that clutter our apartments, to the apartments themselves, all these commodities, and an infinite number more, are bought and sold on the market. Simply put: a commodity is defined as something that was made through human labor, satisfies a demand, and is produced for the purpose of exchange. If I bake a loaf of bread to eat, then it’s just bread. But if I bake it in order to sell it, then the loaf becomes a commodity.</p>
<p class="indent">Production has existed throughout history. Human beings have always labored to make things—tools, food, clothing, shelter—in order to survive. Things manufactured, mined, or grown were not commodities, however, as long as they were made for direct use, rather than to be sold on the market. In hunter-gatherer societies, production was organized for use and consumption by the producers themselves. In feudal societies, peasants were the primary producers. They harvested crops for themselves, as well as a surplus product for the lord. In the current system, goods are not made for the personal consumption of the workers or bosses of a particular business. They are made for the purpose of exchange—that is to be bought and sold. Workers at Apple don’t come home with fistfuls of iPhones. Nor did Steve Jobs live in a castle of iPads. Apple products are manufactured for sale on the market.</p>
<p class="indent">The separation of production from consumption is unique to capitalism and was inconceivable in earlier times because needs were so immediate. A vast distance now exists between the maker and the user of a particular good. Each is anonymous to the other. As Marxist theorist Ernest Mandel wrote: “Someone who essentially produces [in order to] satisfy his own needs or those of his community, lives by the products of his own labor. Production and products, labor and products of labor, are identical for him, in practice as in his mind. In commodity production this unity is broken. The producer of commodities no longer lives directly on the products of his own labor: on the contrary, he can live only if <em>gets rid</em> of these products.”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch02note3" id="ch02note3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">By looking at who produces what and how it will be consumed, we begin the process of uncovering the structure of capitalism. It may seem like a tedious place to start, but it’s where Marx begins <em>Capital</em>. He explains why in the preface:</p>
<p class="blocka"><a id="page_29"/>The value-form [the value of commodities], whose fully developed shape is the money-form, is very simple and slight in content. Nevertheless, the human mind has sought in vain for more than 2,000 years to get to the bottom of it, while on the other hand, there has been at least an approximation to a successful analysis of forms which are much richer in content and more complex. Why? Because the complete body is easier to study than its cells.</p>
<p class="block1">… But for bourgeois society, the commodity-form of the product of labor—or value-form of the commodity—is the economic cell-form. To the superficial observer, the analysis of these forms seems to turn upon minutiae. It does in fact deal with minutiae, but so similarly does microscopic anatomy.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch02note4" id="ch02note4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p class="h3">THE DUAL CHARACTER OF A COMMODITY</p>
<p class="noindent">If the defining aspect of commodities is that they are produced for exchange, we are immediately faced with a conundrum: How are they exchanged? What determines their values in relation to other commodities?</p>
<p class="indent">Marx distinguished between two different kinds of values that we can attribute to goods: use-values and exchange-values. An item’s <small>USE</small>-<small>VALUE</small> is how it is <em>used</em>. The use-value of bread is that it provides nourishment. The use-value of a chair is that it can be sat upon. And so on. Regardless of whether that item is sold on a market, it still has a use-value if it is useful to someone. All societies have thus produced use-values, regardless of whether those items have been commodities to be exchanged. And, even in our current capitalist system, some use-values, like air, are still not commodities. A few expensive novelty jars of “fresh air” notwithstanding, capitalism has not figured out how to bottle up and sell us the air that we breathe.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch02note5" id="ch02note5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">Marx placed no judgment on what it means for something to be <em>useful</em>. He wrote: “The nature of these needs, whether they arise, for example, from the stomach, or the imagination, makes no difference. Nor does it matter how the thing satisfies man’s need, whether directly as a means of subsistence, i.e., an object of consumption, or indirectly as a means of production [producing other commodities].”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch02note6" id="ch02note6"><sup>6</sup></a> At the end of the day, something has a use-value if anyone has want or need for it—whether it is something as vital as bread, as destructive as drone bombers, or as trivial as your 1980s Garbage Pail Kids and 1990s Beanie Babies collections.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch02note7" id="ch02note7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_30"/>Some use-values are universal. We all need air. We all need nourishment of some sort, whether it comes from rice, kale, or cookies. But other use-values are geographically, culturally, and historically determined. Whether there is need or want for a product is not a fixed or evenly determined measurement. People living in the suburbs probably need a lawn mower, hedge clippers, and gardening tools, but someone living in an apartment in New York City is unlikely to have want or space for such items.</p>
<p class="indent">The changing and often subjective “utility” of commodities is one of the reasons why it cannot be the determinant of how much something is worth on the market (see sidebar: “A Marginally Useless Theory?” for more on mainstream economics’ concept of utility). Since a single commodity can often be more or less useful to different people, each person—the logic follows—would be willing to pay different amounts for a particular good. The muffins at your local coffee shop would have to be sold at varying prices based on the hunger level of each customer. Even accounting for average needs, or in cases where the hierarchy of utility is more fixed, it makes no sense as a measure of exchange-value. If it were, bread would be more expensive than cars, and certainly more so than diamonds.</p>
<p class="indent">What then determines the relative value of goods? To answer this question, Marx distinguishes between an item’s use-value and its <small>EXCHANGE-VALUE</small>, the quantity with which one commodity exchanges for another commodity. Whereas use-values are qualitative in nature—it matters a lot to me whether something is a chair or a loaf of bread before I sit on it—exchange-values are purely quantitative. How many loaves of bread make up a monetary equivalent of a single chair? Russian revolutionary Vladimir Lenin summed up Marx’s approach this way:</p>
<p class="blocka">A commodity is, in the first place, a thing that satisfies a human want; in the second place, it is a thing that can be exchanged for another thing. The utility of a thing makes it a <em>use-value</em>. Exchange-value is first of all the ratio, the proportion, in which a certain number of use-values of one kind can be exchanged for a certain number of use-values of another kind.</p>
<p class="block1">Daily experience shows us that millions upon millions of such exchanges are constantly equating with one another in every kind of use-value, even the most diverse and incomparable.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch02note8" id="ch02note8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p class="noindent">These millions upon millions (now trillions upon trillions!) of exchanges make up the daily life and breath of capitalism. The process of exchange of commodities is itself a historical condition. So long as trade between tribes or individuals was casual or episodic, there was no need to have clear measurements of relative values. But once regular networks of exchange and local markets took root, so too did the need for precise costs. As Marx explained:</p>
<p class="block"><a id="page_31"/>The exchange of commodities begins where communities have their boundaries, at their points of contact with other communities…. However, as soon as products have become commodities in the external relations of a community, they also, by reaction, become so in the internal life of the community. Their quantitative exchange relation is at first determined purely by chance. They become exchangeable through the mutual desire of their owners to alienate them. In the meantime, the need for others’ objects of utility gradually establishes itself. The constant repetition of exchange makes it a normal social process. In the course of time, therefore, at least some part of the products must be produced <em>especially for the purpose of exchange</em>. From that moment the distinction between the usefulness of things for direct consumption and their usefulness in exchange becomes firmly established. Their use-value becomes distinguished from their exchange-value. On the other hand, the quantitative proportion in which the things are exchangeable, becomes dependent on their production itself. Custom fixes their values at definite magnitudes.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch02note9" id="ch02note9"><sup>9</sup></a> [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="indent">Capitalist society is organized around the quantitative exchange-values of goods, rather than qualitative human need for use-values. While you or I are primarily concerned with the use-value of items, whether we can sit on a chair or on a loaf of bread, a capitalist does not care what an item’s use is, so long as it will make him money. Use-values only matter to capitalists insofar as they know they must produce something that can be sold, and useless things can’t be sold. But what matters most is exchange-value—how much money can be made from selling those goods. Put another way: the use-value of grain and whether there are people that need to eat is not the system’s main concern, rather its exchange-value is what matters—whether and for how much grain can be exchanged.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch02note10" id="ch02note10"><sup>10</sup></a> And so capitalism is responsible for such grotesque events as dumping grain reserves into the ocean rather than selling at a loss in order to feed hungry people. At the same time, boundless quantities of plastics and disposable everything are churned out without any regard for human and environmental consequences. (See sidebar: “The Waste of Society.”)</p>
<p class="indent">The question of how exchange-value is determined is, therefore, critical to understanding what makes capitalism tick. The commonsense assumption in our society is that exchange-value is somehow an innate characteristic of a product. An average car, for instance, is unquestioningly just “worth” about $30,000. Yet there is no physical manifestation of this value. You can inspect the materiality of a car all you like, but you won’t see or feel or weigh the exchange-value. “So far no chemist has ever discovered exchange-value either in a pearl or a diamond.”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch02note11" id="ch02note11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_32"/>Measuring physical qualities clearly does us no good in the realm of exchange. How do you compare a block of cheese with a bike? If we were trading hay for hay, that would be simple. We could put them on a scale against each other and determine an equal weight for a fair exchange. Of course, that would be a pointless exchange! It’s the <em>difference</em> between use-values that makes them exchangeable… and yet we obviously can’t weigh a bushel of hay against a vat of soup to determine their rate of exchange. How then can two things that possess incommensurate qualities be compared or equated?</p>
<p class="indent">The one property that all commodities have in common, and through which their “value” can be determined, is that each is a product of human labor. In Marx’s words: “Despite their motley appearance,” commodities “have a common denominator.”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch02note12" id="ch02note12"><sup>12</sup></a> Commodities can exchange according to the relative amount of labor-time that it takes to produce them. This basic idea is the core concept behind what’s known as the <small>LABOR THEORY OF VALUE</small>—explained further below.</p>
<p class="indent">But before turning our attention there, one final point about the dual nature of commodities: use-values and exchange-values. The difference, contradiction between, and unity of quality (use-value) and quantity (value) is a recurring theme in volume 1 of <em>Capital</em>. One type of value does not cause the other (how useful an item is does not determine its value on the market; nor does its value on the market determine how useful an item may be to us). Yet despite this lack of causality, the two values of a commodity impact each other, and are inseparable. As Marxist economist David Harvey put it, “The commodity, a singular concept, has two aspects. But you can’t cut the commodity in half and say, that’s the exchange-value, and that’s the use-value. No, the commodity is a unity. But within that unity, there is a dual aspect.”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch02note13" id="ch02note13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">A thing can be a use-value without having an exchange-value. If you make a pie, it will be of use to you as you eat it, but unless you put it up for sale, it has no exchange-value. At the same time, a thing cannot have an exchange-value if it does not have a use-value. If you make a bunch of foul, inedible pies for sale at the local market, and if no one has use for foul, inedible pies, then these pies will also have no exchange-value—no matter how long it took you to make them! The item doesn’t have to be useful to the person or people who produced them. But they have to be useful to <em>someone</em> in order to have an exchange-value. And that’s the purpose of having a market—to find a buyer who will have use for what you’ve created.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_33"/>In fact, it’s precisely the fact that an item has no use-value to its producer that allows it to be an exchange-value. If a tailor sews a coat to wear, she can’t very well sell it to someone else at the same time. An item that has a use-value to the tailor can’t simultaneously have an exchange-value for sale. But if she makes two coats, and can realistically only wear one, the fact that the second coat is redundant and therefore has <em>no</em> use-value to the tailor is exactly what gives it the potential to be an exchange-value.</p>
<p class="indent">Simply put, you can either live in your house, or you can sell your house. You can’t have your cake and eat it too.</p>
<div class="box3">
<p class="box-head">A MARGINALLY USELESS THEORY?</p>
<p class="noindent">The predominant explanation of value in mainstream economics today is the neoclassical theory of “marginalism.” It assumes that a commodity’s worth is determined by laws of supply and demand, mediated by what they term “marginal utility.” This theory argues that value is established on the one hand by individuals maximizing the amount of “utility” (or benefit) that they get from purchasing a good, and on the other hand, a corporation maximizing the amount of profit they can achieve through producing and selling those goods. Where these two values meet determines the cost of a product. To understand the logic of decision-making in the marginalist model, we look at an economy with just two actors: a buyer and a seller.</p>
<p class="indent">Roughly speaking, the basic premise of marginal utility is that consumers demand goods in order to gain maximum benefits from their use. A thirsty person wants a bottle of water in order to quench her thirst. The more bottles of water our thirsty friend buys, the more thirst-quenching “utility” she gains. However, at a certain point, as she gets to feeling more hydrated, each additional bottle of water brings in diminishing returns. While she may have been willing to pay $2.50 or $3.00, desperate for that first bottle of water, by the third bottle she’s unlikely to pay more than $1.00, and by the sixth bottle, doubtless she would pay anything at all—thus reaching “maximum utility.” If we were to chart the amount of money she is willing to spend on bottles of water, we could construct a “demand curve.”</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_34"/>One of the early theoreticians of marginal utility, Stanley Jevons, explained: “Repeated reflection and enquiry has led me to the somewhat novel opinion that value depends entirely upon utility.”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch02note14" id="ch02note14"><sup>14</sup></a> The more a consumer wants something, the more utility it has for her, the more she is willing to pay for it. “Water,” he wrote, “may be roughly described as the most useful of all substances. A quart of water per day has the high utility of saving a person from dying in a most distressing manner. Several gallons a day may possess much utility for such purpose as cooking and washing; but after an adequate supply is secured for these uses, any additional quantity is a matter of indifference.”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch02note15" id="ch02note15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<p class="fig_caption" id="fig3">FIGURE 3. SUPPLY AND DEMAND</p>
<p class="image"><img alt="image" src="../images/img042-01.jpg"/></p>
<p class="indent">The company producing bottled water, on the other hand, measures its “marginal cost,” to see how much it would cost to increase production by each additional bottle of water. The marginal cost then is the cost of producing one more unit of a commodity. It would include any additional costs—more labor-power, more equipment, or factory space—for the next additional unit. Plotting the cost of production for each additional unit allows us to construct a “supply curve.” And where the supply curve and the demand curve meet, we find an equilibrium for prices and quantities of goods produced. There are some complicated assumptions involved in going from the two-actor market to the infinite-actor market of the world of “perfect competition,” but this simple outline gets to the heart of neoclassical logic.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_35"/>Unfortunately, this theory raises more questions than it answers. First, the supply curve assumes that the marginal costs of production rise for every output increase. In their model, production costs keep rising and therefore the only factor that can lead a capitalist to increase production levels would be generating higher income from demand. In reality, as we’ll discuss in chapter five, this is a faulty claim, as scaling up production usually increases efficiencies and reduces the cost of production per item.</p>
<p class="indent">Perhaps more fundamentally troubling to the neoclassical model is that marginalists assume that their model works equally for the commodity of labor-power. But labor-power is a special commodity under capitalism, and workers—the sellers of that commodity—operate with a different set of motivations. Under capitalism, workers are given the “choice” to work or starve. This is a pretty big difference from a company selling water bottles, which can decide to simply walk away from a transaction and not sell if the price drops too low. Depending on the state of the labor market and the level of class struggle, workers’ ability to walk away from such a transaction can be very limited. Given the fact that most people living in our society spend our waking lives producing and selling our labor-power as our only commodity, this is a pretty serious flaw in the neoclassical logic.</p>
<p class="indent">Above all, the neoclassical theory conveniently assumes that values are not determined by labor-time, but by subjective valuations and desires. Capitalism is reduced, in sum, to individual behaviors and decisions. In this paradigm, explained Marxist blogger Brendan Cooney: “Rather than a theory of classes, we have a theory of pure individuals, all seen as equals in the market.”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch02note16" id="ch02note16"><sup>16</sup></a> This shift in bourgeois economics was a <em>deliberate</em> attempt to undermine the labor theory of value. Classical economics was developed during capitalism’s infancy, before class struggles were seen as a threat to the new order; neoclassical economics, on the other hand, afraid of growing working-class power, degenerated into apologetics. As one economist expressed it in 1832: “That labor is the sole source of wealth, seems to be a doctrine as dangerous as it is false, as it unhappily affords a handle to those who would represent all property as belonging to the working classes, and the share which is received by others as a robbery or fraud upon them.”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch02note17" id="ch02note17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<p class="inent"><a id="page_36"/>Marx and Engels dismissed marginal utility as just a fancy way of saying that value is determined by supply and demand (prices go up when demand increases and go down when supply increases).<a href="19_bm006.html#ch02note18" id="ch02note18"><sup>18</sup></a> “The fashionable theory just now here is that of Stanley Jevons,” wrote Engels at the time, “according to which value is determined by utility and on the other hand by the limit of supply (i.e. the cost of production), which is merely a confused and circuitous way of saying that value is determined by supply and demand. Vulgar Economy everywhere!”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch02note19" id="ch02note19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
</div>
<p class="h3">NOT BY GOLD OR BY SILVER, BUT BY LABOR</p>
<p class="noindent">Labor, “the creator of use-values,” in Marx’s words, has been a permanent feature of the human existence. Some kind of expenditure of physical or mental energy is necessary to create the conditions for our species’ survival: shelter, clothes, machines, tools, food, and on. In Marx’s words: it is “a condition of human existence which is independent of all forms of society; it is an eternal natural necessity which mediates the metabolism between man and nature, and therefore human life itself.”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch02note20" id="ch02note20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">The wealth of society, argued Marx, comes from human labor <em>and</em> from nature. “Labor,” he argued at the start of the <em>Critique of the Gotha Programme</em>, “is <em>not the source</em> of all wealth. <em>Nature</em> is just as much the source of use-values (and it is surely of such that material wealth consists!) as labor, which itself is only the manifestation of a force of nature, human labor-power.”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch02note21" id="ch02note21"><sup>21</sup></a> [emphasis in original] Marx understood “wealth” to mean the things that we need to live, survive, and thrive, as distinct from “value,” which is a characteristic we assign to commodities and is socially constructed. As socialist author Paul D’Amato argued, “Value is not really a thing, but a historically evolved relation between human beings that takes the ‘fantastic form of a relation between things.’… Value is a meaningless category outside of market relations.”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch02note22" id="ch02note22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_37"/>We can see that labor is necessary to create the various use-values that make up the wealth of society. But the labor imbued in goods made for sale—<em>commodities—</em>has an added role as a measure of exchange-value. How does it fulfill the latter function?</p>
<p class="indent">Some amount of labor is necessary to power the production of every commodity. In that sense, as we’ve said, it is the common denominator across all goods. The cost to society of making a given commodity—its “value”—can be measured by the amount of labor devoted to its production. And exchange-value is a quantitative representation of that value. Roughly, if it takes ten times as long to make a chair as it does a loaf of bread—that would make a chair about ten times more valuable.</p>
<p class="indent">To become an effective means of measurement, the labor imbued in commodities has to become generalized. Specific work like “baking” or “woodworking” has to be replaced with quantities of generic (or abstract, as Marx calls it) labor-time. The real, concrete labor that has gone into producing a commodity is too varied and complex to be used as a measurement for comparison. But all acts of labor can be boiled down, as Marxist economist David McNally put it, to “expenditures of the <em>general</em> human capacity to exert muscles, energies and brain cells to create or produce something. Even if all commodities come into being through different acts of concrete labor, they nonetheless all share the property of being products of the generic act of human labor, or what Marx calls abstract labor, i.e., labor as a general power abstracted from all its specific forms.”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch02note23" id="ch02note23"><sup>23</sup></a> [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="indent">Marx used his favorite example of a commodity—linen—to explain the point in <em>Capital</em>: “Human labor … creates value, but is not itself value. It becomes value in its coagulated state, in objective form. The value of the linen as a congealed mass of human labor can be expressed only as an ‘objectivity,’ a thing which is materially different from the linen itself and yet common to the linen and all other commodities.”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch02note24" id="ch02note24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">Marx defined this labor-time as <small>HUMAN LABOR IN THE ABSTRACT</small>. Abstract because the exchange-value of a commodity is not determined by <em>what kind</em> of specific or concrete labor went into making something, only <em>how much</em> of it was required. Whereas use-values are defined by the “how” and the “what’” of labor, exchange values are defined only by the “how much.” The market thus reduces specific kinds of labor—for example assembling toaster ovens versus baking bread versus teaching a class—into quantities of generalized abstract labor.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_38"/>Baking is the type of concrete labor that results in bread. But an hour’s worth of “abstract labor” determines that the value of the bread is commensurate with a tenth of the value of a chair. And a toaster oven’s price isn’t determined by the fact that welding, electronics, mechanics, and assembly went into its production. It is measured only by the number of general or abstract hours of labor this adds up to. Simply put, you don’t trade tailoring for mechanics at the store, you trade hour for hour. In Marx’s poetic, if not entirely attractive imagery, first labor is abstracted away from its unique, qualitative form, then it “congeals” back into discernable quantities. He wrote:</p>
<p class="block">The <em>use-values</em> coat and linen are combinations of, on the one hand, productive activity with a definite purpose, and, on the other, cloth and yarn. The <em>values</em> coat and linen, however, are merely congealed quantities of homogenous labor. In the same way, the labor contained in these values does not count by virtue of its productive relation to cloth and yarn, but only as being an expenditure of human labor-power. Tailoring and weaving are the formative elements in the <em>use-values</em> coat and linen, precisely because these two kinds of labor are of different qualities; but only in so far as abstraction is made from their particular qualities, only in so far as both possess the same quality of being human labor, do tailoring and weaving form the substance of the <em>values</em> of the two articles mentioned.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch02note25" id="ch02note25"><sup>25</sup></a> [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="indent">Measurements of abstract labor may be easiest to see in their physical manifestations. The exertion of human energy can clearly transform or combine raw materials into finished products. But the same process is at work if the end result of the efforts is not a physical, but a social, commodity. The product might not be palpably tangible. It might be care performed on a patient. It might be knowledge conveyed to a student. But these outcomes, too, are the product of human labor. And, therefore, the value of those outcomes is determined by the labor-time necessary to generate them, just as it is for physical commodities.</p>
<p class="indent">Service labor, just as other forms of labor, also becomes labor in the abstract. An hour’s worth of tailoring produces a certain number of coats. Just as an hour’s worth of nursing equals some number of patients seen, an hour’s worth of a teacher’s labor produces a certain number of graded tests, an hour’s worth of truck driving to deliver goods covers a certain number of miles, and so on.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_39"/>Nor is the concept of value as determined by labor-time disproved by the difference between relatively skilled and unskilled jobs. It is true that an hour of labor in a skilled industry does indeed contribute more value to a product than an hour of labor in an unskilled industry. The labor that goes into manufacturing a Boeing 737 jetliner produces more value than the labor that goes into making a hamburger. This is because you are paying for several layers of labor-time. One can quickly master what goes into making a hamburger. But the learning curve that goes into being a machinist is steep.</p>
<p class="indent">Therefore the value of a machinist’s labor includes the physical hours worked as well as the labor-time that helped produce their skills in the first place: the teachers, textbook makers, trainers, blueprint drafters, etc. who also contributed their labor to the education and preparation of a Boeing worker. (Importantly, this also creates an incentive within capitalism to innovate in order to de-skill labor, thereby making workers more replaceable and lowering the value of the specific labor in that industry.) The point remains that all labor boils down to units of abstract labor, even if they are now multiplied.</p>
<p class="indent">Finally, it’s important to note that Marx’s intent was not to determine specific market prices. Prices form the starting point of bourgeois economics, which incidentally is why mainstream economists confuse more than they explain. We will explore, in future chapters, some of the factors that contribute to the formation of prices. These appear at the surface of the system. But Marx was more interested in uncovering the <em>underlying</em> dynamics of capitalism: what drives value, how it is produced, and for whom.</p>
<p class="h3">SOCIALLY NECESSARY LABOR-TIME</p>
<p class="noindent">The labor theory of value—that a commodity’s value in relation to other commodities is determined by how much labor has gone into producing it—was not a controversial point during Marx’s day. For this reason, he actually spent very little time explaining or defining the concept. The idea that labor is the source of wealth and value in society was considered an obvious point by classical political economists like David Ricardo and Adam Smith.</p>
<p class="indent">The first line of Adam Smith’s <em>Wealth of Nations</em> is: “The annual labor of every nation is the fund which originally supplies it with necessaries and conveniences of life.”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch02note26" id="ch02note26"><sup>26</sup></a> And if Smith’s words could be mistaken to be rhetorical flourish, he flushes the point out more explicitly later in the book:</p>
<p class="block">The real price of everything, what everything really costs to the man who wants to acquire it, is the toil and trouble of acquiring it… What is bought with money or with goods is purchased by labor as much as what we acquire by the toil of our own body. That money or those goods indeed save us this toil. They contain the value of a certain quantity of labor which we exchange for what is supposed at the time to contain the value of an equal quantity. Labor was the first price, the original purchase-money that was paid for all things. It was not by gold or by silver, but by labor, that all the wealth of the world was originally purchased; and its value, to those who possess it, and who want to exchange it for some new productions, is precisely equal to the quantity of labor which it can enable them to purchase or command.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch02note27" id="ch02note27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page_40"/>Ultimately, the classical economists did not delve far enough into this potentially revolutionary concept. <a href="19_bm006.html#ch02note28" id="ch02note28"><sup>28</sup></a> Marx spent a lot of time taking apart their theories, showing what was worthwhile, and where they fell short. And modern economists—who today function more as apologists for capitalism than as social scientists—have altogether thrown out the idea, fearing its explosive implications. While Smith, Ricardo, and others developed their ideas in a period before working-class struggle emerged, later economists had seen enough militancy and class struggle to fear the radical implications of working-class power.</p>
<p class="indent">That’s why mainstream economists today are known as neoclassical, rather than classical, economists. They profess dedication to the likes of Smith and Ricardo but have discarded the troubling labor theory of value. After all, if the producers of wealth are laborers and not the bosses, then the popular slogan of May 1968, “The boss needs you; You don’t need the boss,” is not abstract hyperbole, but a concrete roadmap for the future.</p>
<p class="indent">Marx’s understanding of value was clearly more aligned to the classical bourgeois economists, who, writing at the early stages of capitalist development, were still genuinely trying to understand and explain the workings of the system. But where Smith and Ricardo left incomplete theories, Marx continued on, developing a social and economic framework on the basis of the labor theory of value. In order for this theory to be an effective analytical guide to understanding capitalism, Marx added a critical element: that the value of a commodity is determined by the amount of <small>SOCIALLY NECESSARY LABOR-TIME</small> that it takes to produce it.</p>
<p class="indent">The socially necessary labor-time is the average amount of time that it takes to produce a commodity “under the conditions of production normal for a given society and with the average degree of skill and intensity of labor prevalent in that society.”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch02note29" id="ch02note29"><sup>29</sup></a> That is to say: what is the average time, using the common tools and technology within society, that it will take to construct a table? If the average is two hours—then this determines the table’s exchange-value.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_41"/>Without understanding socially necessary labor-time, value would be a completely subjective element. If, for instance, the author of this book, being (hopefully) a better writer than a table maker, decided to go into the table making business, my lack of skill and experience might translate into eight hours of labor to produce a (presumably shoddy) table. But this does not mean that my table would be worth four times as much as a table made by an established firm that produces a quality table in two hours. It would simply mean I’ve wasted an extra six hours of my life (or all eight, in the likely case that no one wants to buy my shoddy table). Most, if not all, of the time that I took to make the table would be deemed wasted labor by the market.</p>
<p class="indent">Socially necessary labor-time, as its name implies, is socially and historically determined. How long it takes to produce something in a given society changes over time. IBM’s first personal computer in the 1970s cost thousands of dollars to purchase and could perform relatively few tasks. Today, the technology available to build computers is much more advanced, and therefore necessitates much less labor to create something a lot more complex. Now you can buy a personal computer that is many times more powerful than its 1970s predecessor for less than $300. “Value” under capitalism changes over time, further proof that it is not an inherent quality of the item, but socially determined.</p>
<p class="indent">The regulation of value by the socially necessary labor-time required to produce a given commodity takes on a force and momentum akin to the laws of nature. If tables are produced, on average, in two hours, all shoddy and inefficient table makers are forced to step up their techniques or bow out of table making. Marx writes:</p>
<p class="block">All different kinds of… labor are continually being reduced to the quantitative proportions in which society requires them. The reason for this reduction is that in the midst of the accidental and ever-fluctuating exchange relations between the products, the labor-time socially necessary to produce them asserts itself as a regulative law of nature. In the same way, the law of gravity asserts itself when a person’s house collapses on top of him.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch02note30" id="ch02note30"><sup>30</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">We’ll see how important this force of gravity is as we proceed. But the basic idea here is that if a corporation uses outdated techniques, lackadaisical work routines, or otherwise slow means to produce goods, it will discover bankruptcy as quickly as a house lacking proper construction will discover gravity. As socialist Alex Callinicos put it: “The pressure of competition forces producers to adopt similar methods of production to their rivals, or find themselves undercut.”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch02note31" id="ch02note31"><sup>31</sup></a> A graphic design company would be historically obsolete if it designed websites from scratch using HTML tables. And a mining company that does not utilize the new and dangerous remote control and automation methods in mining would not be “competitive”—incidentally, a good reason to force safety regulations on industries rather than expecting the “laws of the market” to help companies regulate themselves.</p>
<p class="h3"><a id="page_42"/>GENERATIONS OF LABOR</p>
<p class="noindent">The value of a commodity is not solely determined by the labor that directly produced it. The worth of a table, a jetliner, or an iPhone must also include the raw materials, tools, and technology used in the production of these commodities—from wood to turbines to microchips. But these raw materials and machinery are themselves commodities created by labor. As such, they all carry their own labor-determined value into the production of a new commodity. Essentially, their value simply gets passed into the value of the table, jetliner, or iPhone.</p>
<p class="indent">To explain the point, it’s useful to distinguish between what Marx identified as <small>LIVING LABOR</small>—human labor that goes into the production of a commodity in the present time, and <small>DEAD LABOR</small>—previous generations of labor that carry past value into the process of production.</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s go back to the table-making example. I said (arbitrarily, but for the sake of simplicity) that it would take, on average, two hours of labor—including design and manufacture—to make a table. But in order to produce a table, a furniture company will also have to buy materials: wood planks, glue, screws; and equipment: power saws, clamps, sanders, factory belts, and computer programs that generate cutting specifications.</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s say that forty-five minutes of labor produced the amount of wood used and another fifteen minutes of labor generated the glue, screws, etc. used for making one table. That’s another hour’s worth of labor that is hidden in the production process. The raw materials simply pass on their value into a new product—the table.</p>
<p class="indent">Similarly, the value of the equipment used adds a fraction of its value to every round of production. Why a fraction? Take, for example, the value of a factory standard wide-belt sander. It costs about $12,000. Assume (again arbitrarily) that an average sander lasts for about four years before it becomes too worn out to be effectively used. That means that each year, the machine transfers about a quarter of its value to the tables that it sands. During its lifespan it will (the capitalists hope) pass its full value into the goods it’s used to produce.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_43"/>By the time we add in the labor passed on from all the other machinery and rent paid for the factory in which it’s manufactured, its value will be greater still. The point of this very hypothetical example is of course not to determine exact prices, but to show how every component and input into production is measured by socially necessary labor-time.</p>
<p class="indent">Understanding that previous generations of labor embodied in the equipment and materials are “dead labor” but labor nonetheless, highlights the point that workers create value, not—as mainstream economics asserts—a combination of capitalist ingenuity, technology, and (perhaps) a nod to the workers manning that technology. And insofar as they are dead labor, they pass on only the value that was already imbued in them in the past. They cannot, like labor, create new wealth. As Marx explained:</p>
<p class="block">A machine which is not active in the labor process is useless. In addition, it falls prey to the destructive power of natural processes. Iron rusts; wood rots. Yarn with which we neither weave nor knit is cotton wasted. Living labor must seize upon these things, awaken them from the dead, change them from merely possible into real and effective use-values. Bathed in the fire of labor, appropriated as part of its organism, and infused with vital energy for the performance of the functions appropriate to their concept and to their vocation in the process, they are indeed consumed, but to some purpose, as elements in the formation of new use-values, new products, which are capable of entering into individual consumption as means of subsistence or into a new labor process as means of production.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch02note32" id="ch02note32"><sup>32</sup></a></p>
<p class="h3">MONEY AND FETISHISM</p>
<p class="noindent">If we start from this understanding of value, rather than with a surface appearance of prices, the real character of money loses its mystique. Value—which is just a crystallization of abstract labor—is represented by money. We’ll see in the next chapter that money is itself a commodity, which by custom and circumstance, has become a universal measure against which all other items on the market are exchanged. Instead of saying that it takes an equal amount of time to produce a ballpoint pen as a Life Savers candy, we can simply say that they both have a value of ten cents. Thus by being a portable and universal embodiment of value, money simplifies and mediates the process of trading goods.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_44"/>In Marx’s words, “Money necessarily crystalizes out of the process of exchange.”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch02note33" id="ch02note33"><sup>33</sup></a> As markets developed, money became a convenient and necessary substitute for simple barters of commodities based on socially agreed upon labor-times. With money, a producer of bread doesn’t have to go to the marketplace with ten loaves of bread in order to buy a chair. At the same time, a chair maker doesn’t need to exchange her chair for ten loaves of bread if she only wants one today and another loaf later in the week. Money conveniently stores value over time, which its owner can dispense of as he or she sees fit.</p>
<p class="indent">Money also conceals the true nature of value, so that when you go to the supermarket, you don’t think you’re trading an equivalent amount of your “congealed mass of labor” with someone else’s. As David Harvey explained:</p>
<p class="block">You go into a supermarket and you want to buy a head of lettuce. In order to buy the lettuce, you have to put down a certain sum of money. The material relation between the money and the lettuce express a social relation because the price—the “how much”—is socially determined, and the price is a monetary representation of value. Hidden within this market exchange of things is a relation between you, the consumer, and the direct producers—those who labored to produce the lettuce…. The end result is that our social relation to the laboring activities of others is disguised in the relationships between things. You cannot, for example, figure out in the supermarket whether the lettuce has been produced by happy laborers, miserable laborers, slave laborers, wage laborers, or some self-employed peasant. The lettuces are mute, as it were, as to how they were produced and who produced them.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch02note34" id="ch02note34"><sup>34</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">The real social relations of production and exchange are therefore hidden behind a veil of what appears to be a relationship between money and commodities. Instead of human relationships, we have economic relationships between goods. Or as Marx put it: “It is nothing but the definite social relation between men themselves which assumes here, for them, the fantastic form of a relation between things.”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch02note35" id="ch02note35"><sup>35</sup></a> The hidden relations of production—wage labor and, as we’ll see, exploitation—behind this “fantastic form” are specific and peculiar characteristics of capitalism. They did not exist in pre-capitalist class societies, which, despite their brutality, lacked the cloak of “fairness” that capitalism purports.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch02note36" id="ch02note36"><sup>36</sup></a> The process of producing commodities, Marx wrote, “has mastery over man, instead of the opposite.”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch02note37" id="ch02note37"><sup>37</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_45"/>This is the essence of what Marx dubbed <small>COMMODITY FETISHISM</small>. What other way can you describe the modern worship of every new generation of Apple products than fetishism? We idolize these things that we consider to be outside and external to us, but in fact are our own creations. By using the term “fetishism,” Marx was also taking a jab at the philosophers of the Enlightenment, who saw superstition as primitive, and hailed the rationality of capitalism. The thinkers of the Enlightenment promoted science and logic, yet had no problem with a warped reality in which <em>things</em> are powerful and valuable, while <em>human beings</em> relate to each other through the exchange of those things.</p>
<p class="h3">CONCLUSION</p>
<p class="noindent">We’ve traced here the basic contours of Marx’s theory of value. We can see now that capitalism is a system where social relations are determined by, and subordinated to, the exchange of commodities. Each of these commodities has a use-value, whether good (e.g. fruit), bad (e.g. nuclear arsenal), or indifferent (e.g. Garbage Pail Kids). But it is exchange-value that concerns capitalists, and becomes the criteria through which society determines what is or isn’t produced, what is or isn’t worth investment.</p>
<p class="indent">Yet despite the fact that our lives seem to be at the mercy of inanimate exchange-values, the role of labor in determining these values has powerful and revolutionary implications. We’ll explore the role of labor more fully in future chapters. But first, in order to further demystify the machinations of the system, we’ll follow the scent of money, and see exactly how it is that the “coagulated state” of value congeals into bills of paper that can be stacked in your wallet or electronically digitized in the bank.</p>
<div class="box3">
<p class="box-head"><strong>THE WASTE OF SOCIETY</strong></p>
<p class="noindent">Production has expanded exponentially since Marx’s time; our society bursts at the seams with commodities. The drive to make commodities in order to <em>sell</em> them—rather than to directly <em>consume</em> them—gives us a clue as to why the production of commodities expands over the long term. We’ll discuss this further in chapter five. But the essence is that while there may be a limit to how much one feudal lord and his family can consume, production for the market knows no such natural bounds.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_46"/>Capitalism has left no stone unturned in its quest to commodify all living and nonliving matter on the planet—from those as plentiful and mundane as water, to those as absurd and abstract as Wall Street’s financial cocktails.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch02note38" id="ch02note38"><sup>38</sup></a> If there is a dollar to be made, capitalism will find a way to package it up and sell it.</p>
<p class="indent">One way to measure the phenomenal growth of commodities produced under capitalism is to measure the size of our landfills, which now number about two thousand across the country, logging in 265 million metric tons of waste. Of course, official landfills don’t capture the total amount of commodity production and waste, since much of our waste doesn’t end up in landfills. One extreme example is known as the Great Pacific Garbage Patch, a floating island of debris in the Pacific Ocean so large it is visible from space. This drifting stew of junk stretches across an area larger than the state of Texas.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch02note39" id="ch02note39"><sup>39</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">Along with the wealth of society comes the waste of society. Every year, the amount of paper and plastic cups, forks, and spoons used in the United States alone could circle the equator three hundred times. There is also a yearly average of about 380 billion plastic bags and wraps (which themselves require twelve million barrels of oil to create).<a href="19_bm006.html#ch02note40" id="ch02note40"><sup>40</sup></a> According to Heather Rogers: “Every American discards more than 1,600 pounds of rubbish a year, more than 4.5 pounds per person per day.”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch02note41" id="ch02note41"><sup>41</sup></a> Starting in 1960, the US government’s Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has measured the country’s total Municipal Solid Waste (MSW), essentially the everyday items that make up our garbage (food and yard waste, packaging, office paper, clothing, etc.). In 2017, we produced 268 million tons of waste—up from just eighty-eight million tons six decades ago.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch02note42" id="ch02note42"><sup>42</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">Of course, <em>municipal</em> garbage is itself a tiny fraction of the overall waste produced, most of which is generated by industry. But unlike municipal waste, industrial waste is largely untracked. An oft-quoted but vastly out-of-date EPA study in the 1980s found that about 7.6 billion tons of manufacturing waste is created annually.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch02note43" id="ch02note43"><sup>43</sup></a> This conservative estimate is the equivalent weight of over twenty thousand Empire State Buildings, but a lot more toxic.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_47"/>This dramatic increase in annual waste mirrors an overall trend of the system to produce ever-growing amounts of commodities, for sale in ever-expanding markets. Take the automobile industry. According to the Bureau of Transportation Statistics, there were 74 million automobiles registered in the United States in 1960. By 2017 that number nearly quadrupled to 272 million.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch02note44" id="ch02note44"><sup>44</sup></a> More than 96 million automobiles were produced worldwide in 2017 alone.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch02note45" id="ch02note45"><sup>45</sup></a> Similarly in plastics, 381 million tons of plastic were produced annually around the world in 2015, a two-hundred-fold increase since 1950. To put it in context, wrote researchers Hannah Ritchi and Max Roser, “this is roughly equivalent to the mass of two-thirds of the world population.”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch02note46" id="ch02note46"><sup>46</sup></a> A 2014 study found that there were more than five trillion pieces of plastic floating in our oceans. That number is surely larger today.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch02note47" id="ch02note47"><sup>47</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">The explosion of goods in modern society is not only the result of a growing number of commodities in any given market but is also a consequence of the number of things which are now considered <em>marketable</em>. The <em>types</em> of things that are now for sale continue to increase as capitalism commodifies a greater and greater share of our lives. This has happened through the privatization of things like health care and education, which used to be outside the laws of the capitalist market. It has also happened by attaching a price tag to things that previously had none. Rather than finding collective solutions to social problems, all issues are subjugated to the machinations of the market. Corporations can now buy credits to pollute past regulatory standards through the emissions trading market. Thus November 2012 was the unsettling occasion of the country’s first ever auction of greenhouse gas pollution credits in California.</p>
<p class="indent">The market expands further as it insinuates commercial value to women’s bodies and sex on advertisements. And it reaches into every realm of society, taking previously counterculture activities like skateboarding and hawking thousands of magazines, video games, sneakers, and paraphernalia. Kids in the 1980s who made their own ramps to do tricks at home and punks who skated in the 1990s can now buy skateboarding-themed ceramic travel mugs online for $24.95.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_48"/>Along with this expansion comes the ideology of the market as the know-all and cure-all for society’s needs. As David Harvey explains:</p>
<p class="block">To presume that markets and market signals can best determine all allocative decisions is to presume that everything can in principle be treated as a commodity. Commodification presumes the existence of property rights over processes, things, and social relations that a price can be put on them, and that they can be traded subject to legal contract. The market is presumed to work as an appropriate guide—an ethic—for all human action.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch02note48" id="ch02note48"><sup>48</sup></a></p>
