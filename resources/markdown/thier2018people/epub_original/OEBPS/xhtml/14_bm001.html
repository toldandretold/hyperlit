<p class="chap_title"><strong>CAPITALISM’S GRAVEDIGGERS</strong></p>
<p class="noindent">On March 22, 2016, the <em>Financial Times</em> ran an article titled, “‘Peak Death’ Might Not Be Enough to Save the Japanese Funeral Industry.” Apparently, the last two decades have seen a “boom of activity for the sector” in Japan, as the population ages and graveyards fill. Sadly… <em>for the funeral industry</em>… increasing numbers of deaths aren’t translating into higher profits, because the number of mourners have in any case halved. Apparently, the prohibitive cost of putting on funerals has decreased their numbers. As has the fact that fewer Japanese workers have full-time jobs, so the cultural convention of “duty appearance” at funerals by employees has also diminished. The <em>Financial Times</em> soberly reported: “Securing sustainable profit growth even amid rising mortality could become harder, say industry heads.”<a href="19_bm006.html#connote1" id="connote1"><sup>1</sup></a> Capitalism is an absurd and irrational beast that can’t muster caring about lives over profit. But at least the <em>Financial Times</em> has the decency to be honest about it.</p>
<p class="indent">As Marx and Engels wrote in the <em>Communist Manifesto</em>: “All that is solid melts into air, all that is holy is profaned, and man is at last compelled to face with sober senses his real conditions of life, and his relations with his kind.”<a href="19_bm006.html#connote2" id="connote2"><sup>2</sup></a> Capitalism, we are compelled to face, is driven only by what is profitable, and this dictates every facet of our lives—and deaths. The profit motive dishes out material deprivation and ecological destruction. Our relationships with each other face deep alienation. A few make fantastic profits at the expense of the many, who in turn spend most of our waking hours in conditions we have little say over. We live in a society where every decision made by those with power is driven by how much money can be made. In a nutshell, “exchange-value” rules over “use-value.” Profits, over human beings.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_234"/>This state of affairs has been so normalized that we’ve come to take it for granted—if not as the way things <em>should</em> be—at least the way they <em>must</em> be. We go to work, we pay the bills, we go on with our day. Yet the insanity and brutality of it all can’t but rear its ugly head all over our planet, our communities, our lives, every time a cut corner leads to breached levies that could have stopped a hurricane from destroying a city, or a mining disaster buries workers alive. Its ugly head rears through the billions of dollars directed toward speculation in meaningless financial cocktails, or Bitcoins, or other Wall Street gambles, while our public-school systems and hospitals languish in poverty. Its ugly head rears again, climate summit after climate summit, when no agreement with actual teeth is reached because it simply is not profitable to rein in an entire manufacturing edifice built around cheap and dirty energy. It rears again and again and again, when millions of poor people are sacrificed to curable diseases by both the pharmaceutical industry and the global industrial debt complex, which cripples state funding of public health programs. The list goes on, literally ad infinitum.</p>
<p class="indent">If there are just three points that I hope you’ll take away from this book they’re these:</p>
<p class="indent">One: These are not accidents. They are not isolated incidents of greed. They are simply products of the way the system works. Competition is the mainstay of capitalism. It can’t be made friendlier or softer because it <em>requires</em> an accumulation of capital at any cost, in order to get ahead, or get left behind.</p>
<p class="indent">Two: These same processes of accumulation necessarily lead to contradictions that threaten the very profits that capitalists seek. Every contradiction for capitalism is both a great hazard to our lives—since we are made to pay the price—and also an important crack in the system. Every periodic crisis is a potential point around which to organize. If the system seems impenetrable, all the more reason to find its weakest links.</p>
<p class="indent">Three: “The point, however, is to change it,” argued Marx.<a href="19_bm006.html#connote3" id="connote3"><sup>3</sup></a> And this too is the point of this book. Better understanding the system, as Marx wrote: “to reveal the economic law of motion of modern society”<a href="19_bm006.html#connote4" id="connote4"><sup>4</sup></a> is a critical first step. These laws of motion help us to assess the balance of forces, the relative strength or weakness of the ruling class, and their strategies for increasing their profits and our immiseration. But Marx had more to say about how the very development of capitalist industry not only concentrates capital in few hands, but also concentrates workers together into a force that can challenge the system. Capitalism, wrote Marx and Engels, creates its own gravediggers.<a href="19_bm006.html#connote5" id="connote5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_235"/>For the first time in human history, there exists a class with both the interest and the ability to abolish classes and liberate humanity. This is not because workers are inherently heroic, nor because capitalists are inherently evil. Though our respective positions in society do set us against each other in ways that bring out truly heroic working-class struggles, and truly evil repression. But capitalists cannot turn a profit without our labor. Because the system depends on exploitation, the exploited are in a unique position to bring that system down. Workers (sometimes literally, sometimes metaphorically) have our hands on the gears of production. If we collectively withdraw our labor-power, along with it, we withdraw the means to turn a profit. Without profits, the system cannot survive.</p>
<p class="indent">This is why New York City transit workers were able to shut down the entire city when they struck for a very powerful few days in 2005. The threat to profits was so great that the entire political and media establishment went on the attack, jailed their union leader, and broke the strike.<a href="19_bm006.html#connote6" id="connote6"><sup>6</sup></a> In 2014, just seventy workers at Chrysler’s Piston Automotive factory in Toledo forced their bosses to capitulate in a single day by going out on strike. Chrysler’s just-in-time production meant that a strike by Piston’s parts suppliers could have too quickly shut down production at plants across the country. So after unsuccessfully threatening the workers, the company quickly gave into their demands instead.<a href="19_bm006.html#connote7" id="connote7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">Train conductors, Starbucks baristas, teachers, and IT workers—despite differing levels of income, education, and internet savvy—share a common experience of exploitation, and a common enemy in the capitalist class. Whether this shared interest and experience is obscured by cultural propaganda and manipulation or not, does not change the <em>potential</em> for unity.</p>
<p class="indent">Finally, working-class struggle cannot be wielded individually. I can’t simply throw down my shovel (or my laptop) and go on strike, but need the participation of all my coworkers to effectively stop production. Nor can the goal be to win only individual gains. Taking home a shovel, a coffee machine, or a printer will do me little good, but the entire workplace, owned collectively by my coworkers and me could be put to use.</p>
<p class="indent">Of course, the <em>potential</em> to stop production, let alone to unite the working class to bring down the profit system, is not the same as having the actual strength, consciousness, and organization to do so. Quite a few significant obstacles stand in our way. Foremost among them, workers have been effectively divided through the manipulation of racist, sexist, and nationalist ideas. In the United States, racism has been the most important tool in protecting the status quo from a united working class, with its most recent, grotesque <a id="page_236"/>chapter manifesting itself in the Trump era. Racism has been weaponized not only to destroy the lives and families of immigrants, Muslims, and people of color, it has also been used to devastate the living standards of all workers by undermining the solidarity that we need to effectively fight and win.<a href="19_bm006.html#connote8" id="connote8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">Working-class organization has also been physically broken throughout the last couple of centuries, whether by the police, the National Guard, private strikebreakers assaulting picket lines, or through the concerted effort of McCarthyite witch-hunts to root out socialist and radical organizers from the union movement. The challenges of building the fighting capacity of our side are great enough to warrant many other books and discussions, and are easier to see than the episodic glimpses of strength we’ve witnessed in the recent past. Nevertheless, the basic organization of capitalism pushes workers together to fight back, even as these struggles ebb and flow.</p>
<p class="indent">Working-class power is not an abstract concept of historical significance. Capitalism, with its immense productive capacity, has created, for the first time, the ability to wipe out hunger, want, and poverty. The fact that it won’t—and in fact <em>can’t</em>—is its crime. Only the working class has the interest and collective power to bring about a system based on wants instead of profits, by organizing the massive productive powers unleashed by capitalism in collective and sustainable ways. Though a thorough discussion of workers’ power and the prospects for socialism is beyond the purview of this book, it seems appropriate to give Marx the final word:</p>
<p class="blocka">As soon as this metamorphosis has sufficiently decomposed the old society throughout its depth and breadth, as soon as the workers have been turned into proletarians, their means of labor into capital, as soon as the capitalist mode of production stands on its own feet, the further socialization of labor and the further transformation of the soil and other means of production into socially exploited and therefore communal means of production takes on a new form. What is now to be expropriated is not the self-employed worker, but the capitalist who exploits a large number of workers.</p>
<p class="block1">… [T]he mass of misery, oppression, slavery, degradation, and exploitation grows; but with this there also grows the revolt of the working class, a class constantly increasing in numbers, and trained, united, and organized by the very mechanism of the capitalist process of production. The monopoly of capital becomes a fetter upon the mode of production which has flourished alongside and under it. The centralization of the means of production and socialization of labor reach a point at which they become incompatible with their capitalist integument. This integument is burst asunder. The knell of capitalist private property sounds. The expropriators are expropriated.<a href="19_bm006.html#connote9" id="connote9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
