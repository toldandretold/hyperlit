<p class="fm_title"><strong><a id="page_243"/>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</strong></p>
<p class="noindent">Thanks first to David Bodamer. Dave and I initially conceived of this book together, and he poured countless hours of work into getting it off the ground. Circumstances led us to decide that it was best approached as a solo venture, but Dave’s vision and clarity persist in the completed project.</p>
<p class="indent">Thanks as well to the dream team at Haymarket Books: Anthony Arnove’s encouragement and support made this book possible; Nisha Bolsey’s care, thoroughness, and incredible patience was heroic; Maya Marshall’s edits made the manuscript considerably more readable and precise. And I am so grateful for the behind-the-scenes heavy lifts from Charlotte Heltai, Rachel Cohen, and Eric Kerl in shepherding this book through to publication with skill and finesse.</p>
<p class="indent">Daphna Thier and Amy Muldoon slogged through early drafts of the book when it was barely coherent, and their comments helped me move the manuscript onto a more lucid and accessible path. Paul D’Amato’s thoughtful attention and engagement challenged me to grapple more rigorously with many of the book’s themes, and offered innumerable suggestions that improved its substance and arc. Key pieces of the book are better for my discussions with and feedback from Paul Heideman, Michael Zweig, Meghan Behrent, Ashley Smith, Ela Thier, and Charlotte Heltai. Finally, Tania Guerra helped bring my vision for the book to life with her creativity, dedication, and humor.</p>
<p class="indent">When I first started to write this book, I was unemployed and childless. Writing a book seemed like a great idea at the time. Years and many drafts later I am neither childless nor unemployed and the idea seemed much more dubious. In short, I wrote this book about capitalism but under the confines of capitalism, and it was, I’ll be honest, really hard.</p>
<p class="indent">I couldn’t be more grateful for the tremendous support I received from my family. Daphna, Ela, Tzvia, and Uri Thier each provided countless hours <a id="page_244"/>of free childcare in order that this book could be written. My roommates, Daphna, Chris Dols, and Matt Swagler showed perhaps excessive patience with my messiness, grumpiness, and overall ill-mannered behavior throughout the process. And Naim, it seems, tolerated my behavior as well when we should have been out feeding the ducks or roaring like dinosaurs. John Jordan, Holly LaDue, and Maisha Inniss helped me keep my head above water when the discouragement set in. And finally, to every person who told me that they wanted or needed to read this book—thank you, it was those many conversations along the way that kept me on course.</p>
<p class="indent">Thanks most of all to my best friend, comrade, and partner Matt Swagler. Parenting and writing are both wonderfully exhaustive projects, and I found them nearly impossible to pull off simultaneously. Without his indefatigable support, and his insistence that we collectively make this book our priority, it would not have been written.</p>
