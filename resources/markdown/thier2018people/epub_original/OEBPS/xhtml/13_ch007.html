<p class="chap_title"><strong>CREDIT AND FINANCIALIZATION</strong></p>
<p class="block">If the credit system appears as the principal lever of over-production and excessive speculation in commerce, this is simply because the reproduction process, which is elastic by nature, is now forced to its most extreme limit.</p>
<p class="blockr"><em>—Capital, Volume 3<a href="19_bm006.html#ch07note1" id="ch07note1"><sup>1</sup></a></em></p>
<p class="h3">SWINDLERS AND CHEATERS</p>
<p class="noindent">We’ve seen that the very process of accumulation comes into conflict with the system’s own goal of profit making. Capitalism simultaneously bursts through the barriers set in front of it, and in so doing erects new barriers, which threaten its stability and integrity down the line. An additional element must be added in order to understand how these contradictions play out, and that is the role of credit and finance. Although the size and complexity of today’s financial markets have grown tremendously since Marx’s day, his writings on finance capital—in his words, “an entire system of swindling and cheating”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch07note2" id="ch07note2"><sup>2</sup></a>—provide a framework for breaking down this mystifying component of today’s economy.</p>
<p class="indent">In this final chapter we’ll discusses why credit is necessary to the daily functions of capitalism and outline some of the specific roles that it plays. From there we’ll see how finance has evolved to occupy a greater and more absurd stature in today’s economy. And we’ll take an important detour along the way to explain the roots of the Great Recession of 2007 to 2009, not only because its impact has shaped the state of the world economy for years and perhaps decades to come, but also because no other example more clearly illustrates the way that a crisis of overproduction is exacerbated by the role of credit and finance.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_190"/>Credit expands capitalists’ abilities to invest in production. It also increases consumers’ buying power. But these very functions, to hasten and extend production and consumption, also contribute to the system’s contradictions and downturns by intensifying the processes of overproduction and falling profitability. As Marx explained: “The credit system hence accelerates the material development of the productive forces and the creation of the world market… At the same time, credit accelerates the violent outbreaks of this contradiction, crises, and with these the elements of dissolution of the old mode of production.”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch07note3" id="ch07note3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p class="h3">A MOUNTAIN OF DEBT</p>
<p class="noindent">Simply put credit is capital lent out in a variety of forms—from direct loans and cash advances, to stocks and bonds, to mortgages. Capitalism relies on mountains of debt. Every day, corporations borrow large sums of capital to conduct business. So much so that in recent years, the average amount of debt carried by companies is greater than their actual earnings. Typically measured as a debt-to-EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization) ratio, a 2019 S&amp;P report found that companies’ median debt load is 3.2 times their EBITDA.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch07note4" id="ch07note4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">Global debt has hit an all-time high of $253 trillion in 2019.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch07note5" id="ch07note5"><sup>5</sup></a> That is more than three times the total value of the world’s annual economic output.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch07note6" id="ch07note6"><sup>6</sup></a> The amount works out to approximately $30,000 for every man, woman, and child on the face of the planet. This gigantic debt pile is divided amongst non-financial companies, which hold the largest share ($68 trillion), followed by governments ($63 trillion), financial institutions ($58 trillion), and households ($44 trillion).<a href="19_bm006.html#ch07note7" id="ch07note7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">Why capital needs debt to function is easy to see. We defined M–C–M’ as the circuit of capital. But these stages don’t take place in a linear succession. Companies must “grow or die,” and therefore stay in constant motion. Production is ongoing, as is the attempt to sell finished goods. So too then is the need for credit. If companies waited until all their goods were sold before investing in the next round of manufacture, production would happen in fits and starts. Given how integrated the economy is, this would cause the system to stall out. The sheer volume of investment that capitalists need to make is massive, and individuals or corporations typically don’t have enough on reserve themselves to make this happen on the scale and in the speed with which they need to invest. Capitalists must therefore regularly borrow funds to cover the basic costs of reproduction.</p>
<p class="h3"><a id="page_191"/>FICTITIOUS CAPITAL</p>
<p class="noindent">Finance capital—the sector of the economy singularly devoted to lending money—has thus always been a necessary component of capitalism. For as long as large-scale corporations have existed, so to has the issuance and centralization of loans in the form of credits and shares. The Dutch and English East India Companies issued shares in the early seventeeth century, and stock exchanges existed loosely in seventeeth-century Amsterdam and eighteenth-century London. Present-day stock exchanges like the London Stock Exchange and the New York Stock Exchange emerged at the beginning of the nineteenth century, alongside of modern corporations. The synchronicity of the histories of financial and industrial capital is not coincidental. Neither can exist without the other. Corporations depend on investments to fund their growth, while investors bank on shares of companies’ profits, granted through interest payments or dividends.</p>
<p class="indent">As we know, capitalists invest money to buy materials, equipment, infrastructure, and labor-power. Workers engage in a production process in which we are exploited, our unpaid labor turned into surplus value for capitalists. But a section of capitalists take an alternate route.</p>
<p class="indent">Banks and other financial capitalists are capitalists that do not invest in their own production of goods or services, but rather <em>enable</em> production to take place by loaning their funds to <em>other</em> capitalists. In return, financial capitalists are paid back what they loan plus more than a little extra—in the form of interest. These payments come out of the productive capitalists’ realized profits. In a sense, productive capitalists must share out their profits because they need finance in order to operate. As Marx explained: “The part of the profit paid to the owner is called interest, which is just another name, or special term, for a part of the profit given up by capital in the process of functioning to the owner of the capital, instead of putting it into its own pocket.”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch07note8" id="ch07note8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">While M–C–M’ represents the basic circuit of productive capital, from a financial capitalists’ standpoint, the process seems to be M–M’. Money is turned into more money through the mechanisms of loans and interest. But what actually occurs is an extension of our previous formula. Rather than M–C–M’, what we have is: M1–(M–C–M’)–M1’. Here M1 is a portion of the total capital (M) invested that is borrowed from a bank. And at the end of the circuit, the M1’ is returned to the bank in the form of loan payments plus interest. It is a share of the M’ generated by the productive capitalist.</p>
<p class="image"><a id="page_192"/><img alt="image" src="../images/img200-01.jpg"/></p>
<p class="indent">Put in monetary terms, a capitalist may have $20 million in cash on hand to invest. He borrows $80 million from a bank to expand production. Let’s assume a rate of profit of 5 percent and a rate of interest of 5 percent.</p>
<p class="indent">The values would be:</p>
<p class="hang">M1 = $80 million</p>
<p class="hang">M = $100 million<br/>($20 million of cash plus the $80 million borrowed from a bank)</p>
<p class="hang">M’ = $105 million (5 percent rate of profit)</p>
<p class="hang">M1’ = $84 million<br/>($80 million in the loan + $4 million in 5 percent interest)</p>
<p class="noindent1">The bank has turned $80 million into $84 million. While the capitalist, after paying off his loan, has turned $20 million of cash into $21 million. In this model, both productive and financial capitalists have an identical profit rate. What drives capitalists to borrow heavily, however, is an attempt to invest where their profit rates are higher than their interest costs. This can raise their returns above and beyond what they would have otherwise realized with their own cash. But when their bets go bad, they are saddled with a large amount of debt.</p>
<p class="indent">Marx explained the relationship between the creation of value and credit as that of fictitious capital. Fictitious capital is not real, existing capital, but <em>claims</em> on future capital. The value of debts extended—whether through direct loans, stocks and bonds, mortgages, or more complex derivatives, which we’ll discuss later in the chapter—are fictitious because their <em>current</em> values are based on an assumption of the creation of <em>future</em> values and therefore repayment of the loans.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch07note9" id="ch07note9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">In a simple extension of credit, let’s say you lend your roommate $100 to cover the rent in the beginning of the month. You are then entitled to $100 from her at mid-month, when she gets her paycheck. But your right to this future $100 is “fictitious” in that it is based on the anticipation of a forthcoming paycheck. If your roommate should lose her job, or keep the job but need to spend her next paycheck on an unexpected health crisis, or if she’s just a flake and blows it on slot machines—that $100 will never materialize.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_193"/>On a larger scale, corporations may invest extra funds in other companies by lending capital or issuing credit. If, for instance, an auto company cannot profitably employ its capital to produce more cars (i.e. there is not effective demand to sell cars at a profit), it might invest some of its revenue in a growing biotech company instead. Thus <em>idle</em> capital—profits that have outgrown a corporation’s internal investment needs—is converted into <em>active</em> capital, by investing in another corporation’s production. This movement of capital is also what leads to a process we touched upon briefly in the last chapter, in which the rate of profit adjusts across the economy. (See sidebar: “Equalizing Profit Rates.”)</p>
<p class="indent">With the development of the banking system, issuing credits and mediating investments among capitalists became the specialized function of the banks. As Marx explained:</p>
<p class="block">To put it in general terms, the business of banking consists… in concentrating money capital for loan in large masses in the bank’s hands, so that, instead of the individual lender of money, it is the bankers as representatives of all lenders of money who confront the industrial and commercial capitalists. They become the general managers of money capital… A bank represents on the one hand a centralization of money capital, of the lenders, and on the other hand a centralization of the borrowers.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch07note10" id="ch07note10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">One of the foremost early theoreticians of finance capital was Austrian Marxist Rudolf Hilferding. Writing in 1910, at the dawn of modern finance, he described the process: “Special institutions are required for this purpose. The collection and clearance of credit instruments is a task performed by the banks.” Bills of credit can only function, he explained, to the extent that they can be guaranteed. There must be, he continued: “certainty that they will be redeemed; that is if their security as a medium of circulation and means of payment is publicly recognized. This, too, is one of the tasks for the banks. Banks perform both functions by buying bills [of credit]. In so doing, the banker becomes a guarantor of credit and substitutes his own bank credit for commercial craft in so far as he issues a bank note in place of industrial and commercial bills.”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch07note11" id="ch07note11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">Imagine the alternative. You go to buy a $300,000 home, and you arrive at the homeowner’s door with a briefcase of $50,000 in cash and a note that you swear to god, you will pay back the rest. Banks play a necessary mediating role by guaranteeing that loan. They run you through credit checks, debt and income assessments, an assortment of hoops, and ultimately hold the legal power to take your possessions should you fail to pay up. With this small and gracious favor, they take on the risk of holding your debt—along with the significant economic benefit of collecting on your interest payments, likely for the rest of your life.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_194"/>The same is true for the millions of loans that corporations count on daily in order to stay afloat. In facilitating and centralizing credit (be it corporate or consumer debt), banks play a “social” role of moving money through the economy. Finance capital ensures that money that would otherwise be sitting in a cash reserve is put into circulation. As <em>Financial Times</em> columnist Gillian Tett put it in her book <em>Fool’s Gold:</em> “Money is the lifeblood of the economy, and unless it circulates readily, the essential economic activities go into the equivalent of cardiac arrest.”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch07note12" id="ch07note12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">Thus finance capital draws investment from individual or private holders, combines and depersonalizes it, and then extends it for use in the production process. As Hilferding explained, in order for sums of money to become useable capital, the following conditions need to be in place: “(1) The individual sums must be collected until, through centralization, they are sufficiently large to be used in production; (2) they must be made available to the right people; and (3) they must be available for use at the right time.” In short, banks have “taken charge of the conversion of idle capital into active money capital by assembling, concentrating, and distributing it.”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch07note13" id="ch07note13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">As Doug Henwood explained, “The transformation of a future stream of dividend of interest payments into an easily tradeable capital asset is the founding principle of all financial markets … This enables a whole class to own an economy’s productive assets, rather than being bound to a specific property as they once were.”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch07note14" id="ch07note14"><sup>14</sup></a> Of course this role is a “social” one not in the sense that it improves the health and sustainability of any society, but in the sense that it increases the pace of capitalist accumulation… (at great social cost).</p>
<p class="indent">Financial capitalists, for their part, don’t take on the risks associated with these tasks for nothing. They charge interest to make the extension of credit worthwhile. A bank provides a loan at a certain rate of interest to a corporation assuming the corporation will stay in business, maintain profitability, and pay back the loan plus interest. Likewise, a credit card company will assume that you will eternally pay back the interest on the debt that you owe. In this sense, credit extended is capital that may come to be but does not yet exist. (If it never comes into being, only then does the “fictitious” nature of that capital become plain to see, as it did when trillions of dollars disappeared from the stock market during the Great Recession.)</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_195"/>There’s a deeper reason, too, why extending credit creates fictitious capital. Banks are only required to only keep about 3 cents per dollar on hand in cash. This means that for every hundred dollars you deposit to your bank, they can lend out $97 of it. Once that $97 winds up in another bank account, another $94.09 (97 percent) can be lent out again. In this way more money is generated than banks have actual liquidity (cash) to return, should depositors want to withdraw it all. As Marx argued:</p>
<p class="block">With the development of interest-bearing capital and the credit system, all capital seems to be duplicated, and at some point triplicated, by the various ways in which the same capital, or even the same claim [on a debt], appears in various hands in different guises. The greater part of this “money-capital” is purely fictitious. With the exception of the reserve fund, deposits are never more than credits with the banker, and never exist as real deposits.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch07note15" id="ch07note15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">Lastly, an additional layer of fiction is embedded within what are known as “capital markets”—the issuing and trading of stocks and bonds. Along with direct loans from banks, businesses can borrow money by issuing bonds, or they can raise more cash by selling shares of their company in the form of stocks. Bonds are publicly traded debt. Essentially a company is borrowing from public markets by issuing certificates that it agrees to repay at a set time, with a set amount of interest.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch07note16" id="ch07note16"><sup>16</sup></a> Stocks on the other hand, are claims to the total value of a company (its assets minus its debts, or “equity”). Each <em>share</em> is a claim to a fraction of the company’s worth.</p>
<p class="indent">Like all forms of credit, the value of stocks and bonds are based on the assumption that the corporation issuing them will remain profitable and will be able to return the funds advanced (in the case of bonds) or pay out dividends from their profits (in the case of stocks). While bonds accrue interest rates that are agreed upon ahead of time, the value of stocks are only theoretically tied to a company’s total equity. The stock market functions like an auction in which the “value” of stocks are estimated by buyers and sellers many times during the day based on their confidence in <em>future</em> streams of profits. Share prices are recorded every time a sale of the stock takes place, and thus fluctuate constantly as individual buyers and sellers agree to the terms of their trades.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_196"/>The buying and selling of stocks and bonds in and of itself constitutes a titanic amount of economic activity with billions or trillions of dollars coming into existence (if markets rise) or disappearing (if markets fall) on a daily basis. The convoluted nature of these processes does not mean that fictitious capital is devoid of any substance or worth. But assigning a value to credit based on future expectations of growth creates the conditions for wild speculation. Moreover, as we’ll see below, when claims on a future value are packaged up and used as collateral for further investments (i.e. your bank takes the money you owe, and sells that debt in exchange for a second investment), or is used to create derivative financial products, suddenly a whole façade has been erected in which exchanges can be made, and losses and profits booked, apart from real activity in the productive economy.</p>
<div class="box3">
<p class="box-head">EQUALIZING PROFIT RATES</p>
<p class="noindent">The financial system is the infrastructure through which money can move from one part of an economy (for example, auto manufacturing) to another (say, biotech). Through this process a rate of profit becomes generalized across the economy because of the effects of supply and demand.</p>
<p class="indent">As we said in the last chapter, auto manufacturers facing declining car sales may choose to take some of their profits and withhold further investments in the auto industry. They can take that capital and put it in a bank. They can invest it in the stock market. They can invest in a private fund. Regardless of the form it takes, the net result is the same. The capital is withdrawn from the auto industry and placed at the disposal of other capitalists either directly (through the form of direct investment or purchase of a stock or bond) or indirectly (placed in a bank where the deposit becomes the basis for loans). The capital is routed to an industry where the expected rate of return is higher.</p>
<p class="indent">The process represents two sides of the same coin. It is a reduction of investment in an industry where the profit rate is low and the increase in an industry where the profit rate is higher. And as we said previously, the result is a “cool down” of the automobile market, leading to rebounding of profit rates, and a “heating up” of biotech, or another industry, driving down profit rates there. As capitalists move their capital from less profitable industries to more profitable ones, profit rates equalize across the economy as a whole.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_197"/>It’s very difficult to simply shut down an auto plant and convert production toward biotech. It would require massive capital outlays, time, and expertise to build new factories and compete with existing firms. But credit mechanisms are one way in which capital can be redeployed quickly, and for capitalists to gain a share of the profits in a high-profit industry, without starting up new companies from scratch. The financial system allows for that process to take place in a matter of hours rather than years.</p>
</div>
<p class="h3">GREASING THE WHEELS</p>
<p class="noindent">The primary role of credit is to speed up and expand both production and consumption. In our previous example a capitalist with $20 million in capital borrowed $80 million from a bank. In this way accumulation can take place at a much more accelerated pace. In chapter five, we discussed Marx’s writing about the concentration and centralization of capital. He wrote: “The world would still be without railways if it had had to wait until accumulation had got a few individual capitals far enough to be adequate for the construction of a railway. Centralization, however, accomplished this in the twinkling of an eye, by means of joint-stock companies [a company whose stock is owned jointly by the shareholders].”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch07note17" id="ch07note17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">Corporate debt is another means toward centralization. It expands a capitalists’ ability to invest way beyond what would otherwise be possible with its available deposits, by using other capitals. In this case investment increased fivefold through the use of debt. Credit likewise maintains continuity in production by enabling capitalists to begin the next round of production before the sale of the previous round of production has finished.</p>
<p class="indent">Consumers rely on credit as well. If working-class people had to wait until we had saved up enough money to buy a new home in total or enroll our children in college, these things would always be out of reach. It’s very likely that many of us would only gain the benefits of a college education and keg parties in the later years of our lives, if at all. Industries such as auto and construction that produce higher-cost goods would certainly go out of business. This is why every major auto company also has its own financing wing. In order to assure that potential buyers have enough credit to purchase their cars, GM, Ford, and Chrysler created GM Financial, Ford Credit Services, and Chrysler Capital.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_198"/>As credit inflates the “buying power” of consumers, it necessarily speeds up the rate at which goods are bought. This increases the turnover rate of capital—how quickly the production of surplus value turns into the realization of surplus value, and then is reinvested into production. If it takes a full year for an automaker to make and sell ten thousand cars, this will limit the profits it collects. However, if it can do so in three months’ time instead, it can turnover ten thousand cars four times in a given year, and quadruple its profits. In this way, credit greases the wheels of every aspect of production and circulation. German revolutionary Rosa Luxemburg explained this same process over a hundred years ago, in her famous pamphlet, <em>Reform or Revolution.</em> “Credit eliminates the remaining rigidity of capitalist relationships. It introduces everywhere the greatest elasticity possible. It renders all capitalist forces extensible.”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch07note18" id="ch07note18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">Of course, it’s not just high-priced items that need financing to grease the wheels of circulation. As the cost of living rises and wages do not, debt has filled the gap. In the decade since the Great Recession, medical costs have increased 34 percent and food prices by 22 percent. A survey conducted by the nonprofit Dēmos in 2012 found that 40 percent of low- and middle-income households reported using credit cards to pay for basic living expenses such as groceries, gas, or utilities, because they did not have enough money in their checking or savings accounts.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch07note19" id="ch07note19"><sup>19</sup></a> This number has surely risen since, along with the average credit card debt per household. See <a href="#fig9">Figure 9</a>. Young people in the US are under $1.3 trillion of student debt. No wonder: the cost of college has gone up over 1120 percent between 1978 and 2012.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch07note20" id="ch07note20"><sup>20</sup></a> A 2017 study by Kaiser Family Foundation found that 37 percent of households have increased credit card debt to pay for medical bills and are racking up hundreds of dollars in <em>interest</em> payments on medical expenses alone.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch07note21" id="ch07note21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>

<p class="indent">In short, working-class households have become increasingly dependent on credit card, student, and mortgage loans because incomes have declined or stagnated for the last several decades. Workers have been paid below the value of labor-power (that is, the amount of money that it costs to reproduce themselves and their families); to make up for it, the vast majority have gone into debt to survive. In the process, they—and their debts—have become deeply enmeshed in financial markets, as we’ll see later.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch07note22" id="ch07note22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<p class="h3">CREDIT’S SPECULATIVE ROLE</p>
<p class="noindent">Greasing the wheels of the economy has an added effect of exaggerating capitalism’s proclivity toward speculation.</p>
<p class="indent">As long as there have been markets, there have been speculative bubbles: trading of commodities at vastly inflated prices. The Dutch Tulip Mania in the 1600s is one particularly ludicrous, oft-quoted example. At the peak of Tulip Mania, in March 1637, some single-tulip bulbs sold for more than 10 times the annual income of a skilled craftsman, and bulbs were trading hands as many as 10 times a day. In the last 20 years, there have been a series of bubbles in various assets, all of which eventually popped with disastrous results: the Asian financial crisis in the late 1990s was driven by a collapse in real estate and currency prices. In the late 1990s and early 2000s a substantial bubble in technology stocks grew and then burst. Preceding the Great Recession, many countries experienced dramatic bubbles in residential and commercial real estate.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_200"/>In a sense, all investment is speculative. Capitalists are never guaranteed a profit when they invest in anything. But the availability of large pools of credit allows financiers to engage in far riskier behavior than they would otherwise take part in were they using their own capital, and with larger volume. The riskier the behavior, in fact, the greater the potential payout, in the form of higher interest rates. As Marx argued, “a large part of the social capital is employed by people who do not own it and who consequently tackle things quite differently than the owner, who anxiously weighs the limitations of his private capital in so far as he handles it himself.”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch07note23" id="ch07note23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">Rather than profiting off the growing value of expanded production, investors buy or sell assets based on the expected direction of price movements. These assets may have little identifiable substance, such as complex financial cocktails discussed subsequently, but their “value” is driven by the expectation that they will sell at a higher price down the road to someone else. As economics professor Gerald Friedman explained in the pages of <em>Dollars &amp; Sense:</em> “Unlike tangible commodities whose price should reflect its real value and real cost of production, financial assets are not priced according to any real returns nor even according to some expected return, but rather according to expectations of what others will pay in the future, or, even worse, expectations of future expectations that others will have of assets’ future returns.”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch07note24" id="ch07note24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">Speculation can take off and snowball quickly because much of bourgeois economics rests on a delusional premise that markets will always expand. This was woefully evident in the recent rollercoaster ride of the oil and gas market, which we discussed in the previous chapter. In the years of the oil boom, production nearly doubled and spending by oil companies quadrupled. This massive expansion was fueled by enormous outlays of credit, and predicated on an expectation that oil prices could rise forever. As a result, the global oil and gas industry nearly tripled its debt from $1.1 trillion to $3 trillion between 2006 and 2014. Energy economist Philip Verleger described it as a “classic bubble” to the <em>Financial Times.</em> “It was irrational investment: expecting prices to rise continually. Companies that borrowed heavily when prices were high are going to have a very tough time.”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch07note25" id="ch07note25"><sup>25</sup></a> The combination of high oil prices and cheap credit brought about by near-zero interest rates created, said the <em>Times</em>, a “potent mix.”</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_201"/>The entry of speculators into a market itself plays a significant role in inflating prices. If, for instance, the tulip market of the seventeenth century only consisted of people who grew tulips, and shop owners that bought them for their flower stores, prices could fluctuate above or below a base value based on changes in supply or demand. Unfavorable growing conditions might diminish supply and therefore increase prices. Or a season of perfect weather might lead to a greater abundance of tulips, with roughly the same number of buyers, and therefore to a lower price. But these vacillations would be confined to a somewhat narrow range.</p>
<p class="indent">If, however, financial investors, noticing a trend in higher costs for tulips, started buying up more flowers in anticipation of continued price increases, they would be engaged in speculation. Their participation in the market would drive prices further by vastly increasing demand far past the tulip supply. This effect can easily snowball and create considerable price bubbles. As professor and blogger Lawrence Mitchell described it: “Think of the shape of a tornado. The productive asset—the asset that generated the revenue to pay the claims—was a point at the bottom. As claims proliferated from that point up, they expanded higher and higher, wider and wider, far beyond the capacity of the energy at the bottom—the earnings—to sustain it.”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch07note26" id="ch07note26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">To take a more current example, a real estate market that simply consisted of sellers of homes (who either built new houses or were selling their own houses) and buyers (who intended on moving into a new house) would also experience limited fluctuations in market prices. But the housing market has many more complicated players. Some investors buy up homes in order to rent them, and others “flip houses,” i.e. they buy the property only for the sake of quickly reselling it at an even higher price. During the recent housing bubble, speculation played a significant role in creating a massive bubble.</p>
<p class="indent">According to the New York Federal Reserve’s blog, <em>Liberty Street Economics</em>:</p>
<p class="block">At the peak of the boom in 2006, over a third of all US home purchase lending was made to people who already owned at least one house. In the four states with the most pronounced housing cycles, the investor share was nearly half—45 percent. Investor shares roughly doubled between 2000 and 2006. While some of these loans went to borrowers with “just” two homes, the increase in percentage terms is largest among those owning three or more properties. In 2006, Arizona, California, Florida, and Nevada investors owning three or more properties were responsible for nearly 20 percent of originations, almost triple their share in 2000.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch07note27" id="ch07note27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_202"/>Speculators play reckless and destructive roles in the economy. As Rosa Luxemburg explained, “[Credit] stimulates… the bold and unscrupulous utilization of the property of others. That is, it leads to speculation. Credit not only aggravates the crisis in its capacity as a dissembled means of exchange, it also helps to bring and extend the crisis by transforming all exchange into an extremely complex and artificial mechanism that, having a minimum of metallic money as a real base, is easily disarranged at the slightest occasion.”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch07note28" id="ch07note28"><sup>28</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">Credit therefore allows for a great deal of speculation and gambling that has little relationship to production and the “real” economy. With it, the pace and growth of bubbles can be spectacular. The unrealizable expectation of an ever-expanding market, that someone will always be found to pay more, eventually hits the market’s saturation point and the bottom falls out. Once it does, credit dries up just as quickly as it had appeared. Only at this point does the relationship between speculation and more systemic economic developments of overproduction in the economy become clear.</p>
<p class="h3">CREDIT FLEES IN CRISES</p>
<p class="noindent">Credit’s role of facilitating the expansion in times of boom also lays the basis for more dramatic crashes. Capitalists, we said, see any limitations of demand in the market as simple barriers to be overcome and “laughed off,” leading to crises of overproduction. Credit further exacerbates this problem as it easily (at least temporarily) removes barriers to both production and consumption. And it hides any growing gaps between supply and demand for long periods of time. As Marx wrote, “The credit system appears as the main lever of over-production and over-speculation in commerce solely because the reproduction process, which is elastic by nature, is here forced to its extreme limits.”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch07note29" id="ch07note29"><sup>29</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">On the other end of the boom-and-bust cycle, credit dries up when earnings start to shrink. A crisis of profitability will trigger a credit squeeze and further impede production. Following on the heels of the Great Recession, banks sat on reserve piles of over $1 trillion in 2010. The previous record had been set at $19 billion dollars in 2001.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch07note30" id="ch07note30"><sup>30</sup></a> No matter how cheap the US government made credit available to banks to loan through its central bank, the Federal Reserve, they simply wouldn’t extend loans. Luxemburg wrote:</p>
<p class="block">After having (as a factor of the process of production) provoked overproduction, credit (as a factor of exchange) destroys, during the crisis, the very productive forces it itself created…. At the first symptom of the crisis, credit melts away. It abandons exchange where it would still be found indispensable, and appearing instead, ineffective and useless, there where some exchange still continues, it reduces to a minimum the consumption capacity of the market.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch07note31" id="ch07note31"><sup>31</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_203"/>But we don’t have to leave it to Marx and Luxemburg to make the case. Even the mouthpiece of the ruling class, the <em>Financial Times</em>, explained the role of credit and finance capital this way in an editorial:</p>
<p class="block">Modern capitalism needs well-functioning banks. Businesses and individuals need liquidity and an effective means of turning their savings into productive investments. But banks perform this function by making bets on the future. This is the purpose for which they exist—but it makes them inherently unstable. They tend to over-extend themselves in the good times and are over-cautious in the bad, exacerbating booms and busts.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch07note32" id="ch07note32"><sup>32</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">To return to the example of oil, companies that accrued titanic piles of debt during the boom in production were no longer able to pay the interest on their loans or take out new loans once their profit margins diminished. The industry, explains the <em>Financial Times</em>, “had a cost structure and debt burden that were manageable if crude stayed at about that [price] level” of over $100 a barrel. “Now the boom has gone, but the debt remains.”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch07note33" id="ch07note33"><sup>33</sup></a> Just at the moment when credit would be most necessary to keep companies afloat, banks and investors sense the ship is sinking, and refuse to lend, for fear of getting stuck with more bad loans.</p>
<p class="indent">This process played out quite clearly, and explosively, during the years of the Great Recession. To set the context for how that crisis unfolded, we will first take a step back to see how the perfect storm of overproduction, economic polarization, and the monstrous growth of finance gave rise to the deepest recession since the Great Depression.</p>
<p class="h3">THE CAPITALIST FUNHOUSE</p>
<p class="noindent">We can see that finance capital has always been a critical—if highly volatile and destructive—mainstay of capitalism. Yet in recent decades, the size, complexity, and influence of finance in the economy have intensified wildly. Economists have used the term financialization to describe its ascendancy. In the words of economist Gerald Epstein, we are witnessing “the increasing importance of financial markets, financial motives, financial institutions, and financial elites in the operation of the economy and its governing institutions.”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch07note34" id="ch07note34"><sup>34</sup></a> Indeed the scale of its evolution has been so immense that mainstream economic discussion often paints the financial sphere as floating off on its own, independent from capitalism’s productive sphere and the process of accumulation, and as responsible for self-generating massive amounts of wealth.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_204"/>Since the 1970s, changes in the US and international economies have led to a set of unique changes to the financial systems, which hit a fever pitch by the 1990s. As <em>Monthly Review</em> editor John Bellamy Foster explained: “The average daily volume of foreign exchange transactions rose from $570 billion in 1989 to $2.7 trillion dollars in 2006. Since 2001 the global credit derivatives market (the global market in credit risk transfer instruments) has grown at a rate of over 100 percent per year. Of relatively little significance at the beginning of the new millennium, the notional value of credit derivatives traded globally ballooned to $26 trillion by the first half of 2006.”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch07note35" id="ch07note35"><sup>35</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">Deregulation and the increasing autonomy of the financial sector have created a series of smoke and funhouse mirrors, and intensified the tendencies toward speculative bubbles and financial meltdowns. As Greek economist Demophanes Papadatos explained: “The rise of finance was combined with a broad set of other practices: deregulation, direct confrontation with the workers’ movement and unions, a policy favorable to larger mergers, and new methods of corporate governance favorable to the interests of shareholders.”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch07note36" id="ch07note36"><sup>36</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">In the 1970s, what became known as the “neoliberal revolution” overthrew much of the regulatory structures that were imposed on finance in the wake of the Great Depression. We’ll discuss neoliberalism further later. This decade saw the breakdown of the Bretton Woods agreement<a href="19_bm006.html#ch07note37" id="ch07note37"><sup>37</sup></a> and floating exchange rates, increased capital mobility, deregulation, and privatization of social benefits, such as pensions. All this provided fertile ground for risk hedging and speculation. Deregulation opened the door to an explosion of currency markets and a drive to “securitize” everything: i.e. transform debt into financial instruments, which can be publicly traded. This trend followed, but also exacerbated, a surge of consumer, financial, and corporate debt.</p>
<p class="h3">THE COMMODIFICATION OF DEBT: PHANTOMS OF THE MIND</p>
<p class="noindent">Profiteering off of debts and credits has since become tremendously lucrative. While in 1973, David McNally explained, “financial returns made up just 16 percent of total profits in the American economy—a level that remained steady until the mid-1980s,” by 2007, “financial gains had soared to fully 41 percent of all US profits: And because these profits derive overwhelmingly from loans, their stupendous rise could only mean one thing: mounting levels of indebtedness throughout the economy… from slightly more than $10 trillion [in 1987] to $43 trillion [in 2005].”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch07note38" id="ch07note38"><sup>38</sup></a> US household debt exploded to 130 percent of disposable income (income minus taxes) in 2007.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch07note39" id="ch07note39"><sup>39</sup></a> But while consumer debt doubled between 1980 and 2007, the amount of debt held by financial institutions quintupled as a proportion of GDP.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch07note40" id="ch07note40"><sup>40</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_205"/>The US elite was looking for a means to profitably invest their growing capital. This process accelerated in the early 2000s, as oil prices doubled, and individuals rich off the oil industry as well as governments of oil-producing nations found themselves holding even greater piles of cash, searching for an outlet. Increasingly, financial institutions handling these investments looked outside of traditional venues such as treasury bonds, where low interest rates produced too-low returns. In the 1970s, 10-year government bonds yielded 9 percent returns per year, by 2002, they yielded only about 4 percent returns.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch07note41" id="ch07note41"><sup>41</sup></a> “Everyone was looking for a yield,” explained T.J. Lim, one of the early members of J.P. Morgan’s swaps team. “You could do almost anything you could dream of, and people would buy it. Every week, somebody would think of a new product.” <a href="19_bm006.html#ch07note42" id="ch07note42"><sup>42</sup></a> And so, capital investment found an effective channel in the form of packaging up and selling consumer debt, ushering in an “age of securitization.”</p>
<p class="indent">New types of securities—financial assets that are tradeable—have been created that repackage any manner of existing debt. Basic securities include bonds: tradeable debt; and stocks: tradeable equity in a company. More complex packages allow a bank to mix-and-match. They can break up your mortgage, your neighbor’s student loan, and thousands of other loans into tiny pieces. Then they create a basket with bits of each of these debts and repackage them into a new <small>DERIVATIVE</small>—a type of security or financial contract that <em>derives</em> its value from another asset. Derivatives include a variety of instruments, including futures, forwards, swaps, and options, some of which we’ll discuss later.</p>
<p class="indent">Securitization of debt took off in the 1990s, and reached explosive proportions in the 2000s. In 2000, “the amount of debt Wall Street bought, packaged, and sold equaled $1 trillion …. Five years later, the number was $2.7 trillion, a 270 percent increase in half a decade.”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch07note43" id="ch07note43"><sup>43</sup></a> The exponential growth of derivative markets was aided by the deregulatory drive of broader neoliberal policies. As David Harvey described in his <em>History of Neoliberalism</em>, “Increasingly freed from the regulatory constraints and barriers that had hitherto confined its field of action, financial activity could flourish as never before, eventually everywhere. A wave of in-novations occurred in financial services to produce not only far more sophisticated global interconnections but also new kinds of financial-market-based securitization, derivatives, and all manner of futures trading. Neoliberalism has meant, in short, the financialization of everything.”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch07note44" id="ch07note44"><sup>44</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_206"/>The rush to securitize debt thus took the concept of fictitious capital to new and absurd proportions. Claims on future value, not only stocks and loans, but much more complex financial derivatives, became commodities in their own right. Lacking any tangible qualities, and increasingly removed from any physical entity they may have originated from, these new securities can be bought, sold, traded, and borrowed against. As Marx laid out: “Profits and losses that result from fluctuations in the prices of these ownership titles [securities]… are by the nature of the case more and more the result of gambling, which now <em>appears</em> in place of labor as the original source of capital ownership.”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch07note45" id="ch07note45"><sup>45</sup></a> [Emphasis added. Marx often used the word “appear” to signal that something different is happening below the surface.]</p>
<p class="indent">A first layer of debt-based securities is organized into <small>COLLATERALIZED DEBT OBLIGATIONS</small> (CDOs). These are bits and pieces of thousands of loans, packaged up and sold off to investors, who buy the rights to collect on streams of interest payments due on each of these loans. The resulting pools are then divided into “tranches,” representing different levels of risk, and organized into different rates of return.</p>
<p class="indent">In the lead up to the Great Recession, at the heart of many CDOs lived subprime mortgages—loans that require little money down and skirt credit requirements for borrowers looking to purchase a new home. But these loans incur steeply rising, high interest rates down the road. The high interest rates are a boon to investors. And slicing up the debts and bundling them into new baskets spreads the risk out to many investors. The expectation was that although it is likely that one or a handful of mortgages will go into default, if they are pooled with thousands of others, and then widely dispersed, the overall level of risk declines. (Of course, this only works if there isn’t a wave of defaults, generalized across the business. Oops.)</p>
<p class="indent">Further, investors paying for the riskier tranches take the “first loss” position. That is, in exchange for the higher rate of return, they agree to assume the first level of defaults that occur, protecting investors in the less-risky tranches. Essentially, the chancier the loan, the higher the rates of return. Thus first debt is commodified, then risk, too, is commodified. The commodification of risk, and the tremendous rates of profit that could be achieved through trading it, provided added incentive for banks to push subprime and other unsound loans as widely as possible.</p>
<p class="indent">If this model wasn’t problematic enough, financial institutions also came up with a product called <small>CREDIT DEFAULT SWAPS</small> (CDSs), which further magnified the damaging impact of these wild gambling schemes when mortgages started to sour at unprecedented rates. CDSs are supposed to function as a form of insurance; i.e., an investor that has purchased securities could acquire a CDS from another entity that promises to pay the investor its expected returns in the event that the security failed.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_207"/>Say you owned a security that promised a $100 payout per month based on the monthly payments generated by the mortgages that were pooled together. You could then approach a third party and for the cost of, say, $1 per month, enter a credit-default swap whereby the third party would agree to pay you $100 per month in the event that the pool failed. In functioning market conditions, this seems like a great arrangement for all involved. The investor gets their $100 payout per month, but for just $1 acquires some insurance. The entity on the other side is essentially getting a $1 payout for doing nothing.</p>
<p class="indent">But the doomsday scenario of the pool failing suddenly means the entity that had been collecting $1 per month is now suddenly on the hook for the $100 payout it promised to insure through the CDS. This is exactly what happened in 2008 at great speeds, and the entities that issued the swaps did not have the liquidity on hand to make good on the CDSs that they had issued.</p>
<p class="indent">To make matters many orders of magnitude worse, because the CDS market is not bound by the typical rules of insurance, it became a playing field for mass speculation.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch07note46" id="ch07note46"><sup>46</sup></a> Traditionally, the way insurance works is that you have to actually own an asset to purchase insurance for it. So, for example, you are not allowed to buy a fire insurance policy on your neighbor’s house and then collect on it if your neighbor’s house is destroyed. (Such an arrangement would not only incentivize arson, it would also be disastrous for insurance companies who could then be on the hook for many insurance payouts from the destruction of just one house.)</p>
<p class="indent">But none of this was true for the CDS market. Instead, it was perfectly legal to buy credit default swaps on assets you didn’t own. And, in fact, the value of the CDS market came to dwarf the value of the actual securities that were supposedly being insured. By 2007, the CDS market was approximately $60 trillion strong, despite the fact that it was insuring about $6 trillion worth of CDOs!<a href="19_bm006.html#ch07note47" id="ch07note47"><sup>47</sup></a> The value of CDSs was also, incidentally, five times the size of the entire US economy. In a sense, every new layer of securitized debt seemed to duplicate the original credit in multiple hands. As Marx put it, “everything in this credit system appears in duplicate and triplicate, and is transformed into a mere phantom of the mind.”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch07note48" id="ch07note48"><sup>48</sup></a> So when the market crashed, the amount owed by CDS issuers was astronomical and, in fact, so were the claims that could not be paid out. The worst in the field was the insurance giant that went bust: AIG. AIG alone had insured more than $440 billion worth of CDOs—about 3 percent of the total Gross Domestic Product for the entire United States that year—far surpassing the amount they had on hand to cover them. <a href="19_bm006.html#ch07note49" id="ch07note49"><sup>49</sup></a></p>
<p class="h3"><a id="page_208"/>THE EVOLUTION OF MODERN BANKING</p>
<p class="noindent">What has become of the role traditionally ascribed by Hilferding and others to banks—that of organizing, concentrating, and distributing capital? In their fundamentals, these functions have stayed the same, because banks’ commitment to profit above all else has <em>always</em> guided the way in which they carry out their “social” role. The treacherous practice of pushing subprime loans onto working class and poor people in no way represents a departure for banks. They have found it profoundly profitable to thrust all manner of financial products onto sections of the population that were previously cut off from the system. And they have gotten away with imposing the highest interest rates on workers, the poor, and people of color.</p>
<p class="indent">Thus subprime mortgages have joined overdraft fees, high-interest rate credit cards complete with astronomical fees and penalties, and payday loans in a long list of predatory products, which are designed to sap income from the poor. Banks, credit cards, and other financial institutions prey on poor people with these measures, knowing that they don’t have other means to access cash. As anti-apartheid activist Steve Biko once remarked, “It is very expensive to be poor.”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch07note50" id="ch07note50"><sup>50</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">Yet, in the era of intensifying financialization, banks have increasingly turned toward further flung methods of “financial expropriation”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch07note51" id="ch07note51"><sup>51</sup></a> by slicing and dicing risk, and collecting huge sums from transaction fees along the way. Historically, commercial banks have operated as entities that “borrow short” and “lend long.” That is, they borrow in the <em>short-term</em> from deposits of individuals (every time we deposit paychecks in our bank accounts) and from other banks, including Central Banks. And they originate <em>long-term</em> debt in the form of mortgages and loans. Because they “lend long,” they have certain liquidity requirements in order to deal with day-to-day deposit withdrawals and their own daily activities.</p>
<p class="indent">Securitization, however, provides a way to circumvent this model by enabling banks to get their “long” assets off the books quickly. Rather than having a mortgage on its books for thirty years, the loan can be pooled, repackaged, and sold off. This process has the potential to be very profitable. A bank can make a lot of loans with little regard to how likely it is that they’ll ever be repaid. Rather than holding on to the loans (and therefore the risks associated with them), debts can be sliced up and sold to institutions that specialize in the creation of financial instruments. Banks thus move loans off their books in short order, shifting their income stream to the quick fees associated with selling securities, rather than long-term interest payments from loans. Other financial institutions charge fees as well: a whole host of intermediary institutions and corporations make money off transaction fees every time these baskets of debt exchange hands.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_209"/>At the same time, the process of deregulation, which let banks siphon off debts and decrease the amount of cash reserves they had on hand, also allowed for a proliferation of other institutions and companies accessing financial markets. Corporations thus increasingly rely on direct access to markets either by creating their own financial wings, or through <small>SHADOW BANKS</small>—financial intermediaries that perform bank-like activity, but are not regulated as banks. With assets totaling tens of trillions of dollars, so-called shadow banks account for a hefty share of the global financial system—half if you include insurance and pension funds, which similarly deal in financial instruments without banking regulation.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch07note52" id="ch07note52"><sup>52</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">As explained in the <em>Economist</em>, shadow banks include everything from “mobile payment systems, pawnshops, peer-to-peer lending websites,” to “hedge funds and bond-trading platforms set up by technology firms. Among the biggest are asset management companies. In 2013 investment funds that make such loans raised a whopping $97 billion worldwide.”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch07note53" id="ch07note53"><sup>53</sup></a> But among the most influential of the shadow banks are the ones set up by banks themselves, like <small>STRUCTURED INVESTMENT VEHICLES</small> (SIVs) created in order to repackage bank loans into bonds. SIVs were just another way for banks to off-load their riskier loans from the balance sheets, and increase the amount of debt that the bank could therefore take on. But because sponsoring banks were ultimately on the line to back up any liquidity gaps, when the debt went south they dragged the banks down with them rather than containing risk.</p>
<p class="indent">“These vehicles,” argued one <em>Economist</em> writer,</p>
<p class="block">were meant to expand credit, and thus bolster the economy, while spreading the risks involved; at least that was the justification for excluding them from the banks’ liabilities and allowing them to hold relatively little capital to protect against potential losses. Yet when they got into trouble, the banks had to bail them out on such a scale that many of the banks themselves then needed bailing out. The vehicles turned out to be an accounting gimmick dressed up as a service to society.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch07note54" id="ch07note54"><sup>54</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_210"/>While SIVs have faced some tightening regulations following the financial crisis, by and large the tendency toward shadow banking has only increased in recent years, as banks have worked to reduce their liability, and greater lending is left to the purview of their shadowy cousins. Today, the <em>Economist</em> continued, “the world’s biggest asset manager, BlackRock, with about $4 trillion under management, is now considerably larger than the biggest bank, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, with assets of roughly $3 trillion. Before the crisis the reverse was true.”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch07note55" id="ch07note55"><sup>55</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">Corporations, too, set up financing wings to get in directly on the financialization schemes. So, for instance, as a <em>Business Week</em> article noted: “While General Motors Corporation (GM) is having trouble selling cars, its <a href="http://ditech.com">ditech.com</a> mortgage business is going great guns. GM’s financing operations earned $2.9 billion last year, while GM lost money on cars.”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch07note56" id="ch07note56"><sup>56</sup></a> Similarly, “when US Steel changed its name to USX (purchasing strong stakes in insurance) the chairman of the board, James Roderick replied to the question ‘What is X?’ with the simple answer ‘X stands for money.’”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch07note57" id="ch07note57"><sup>57</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">The control of finance in private hands, in arenas subject to even less government regulation, aided in the proliferation of financial mechanisms and in reaching new heights of speculation.</p>
<p class="h3">THE ROOTS OF THE GREAT RECESSION</p>
<p class="noindent">Given the staggering level of financial speculation let loose over the past few decades, it should come as no surprise that the house of cards eventually collapsed. Yet the roots of the Great Recession of 2007 into 2009 run deeper than the world of banking and finance. In fact, the recession was the outcome of two crises of overproduction. The first developed in the late 1990s in Asia. Unresolved issues of this crisis culminated in a second, even greater crisis a decade later. We’ll see that finance played a magnifying and integral role in the way that these played out, but one that is intrinsically tied to the so-called “real” productive economy.</p>
<p class="indent">Marx argued that crises do not originate in the field of credit, but nevertheless first <em>appear</em> there. He wrote: “In a system of production where … the reproduction process rests on credit, a crisis must inevitably break out if credit is suddenly withdrawn … in the form of a violent scramble for means of payment. At first glance, therefore, the entire crisis presents itself as simply a credit and monetary crisis.”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch07note58" id="ch07note58"><sup>58</sup></a> In other words, because the system depends on credit, and because the extension of credit both prolongs the expansion of production and then dries up when boom turns bust, it gives the impression that this is where the crisis begins. Marx continued:</p>
<p class="block"><a id="page_211"/>[The crisis] does involve… the convertibility of bills of exchange [extension of credit] into money. The majority of these bills represent actual purchases and sales, the ultimate basis of the entire crisis being the expansion of these far beyond the social need. On top of this, however, a tremendous number of these bills represent purely fraudulent deals, which now come to light and explode; as well as unsuccessful speculations conducted with borrowed capital, and finally commodity capitals that are either devalued or unsaleable, or returns that are never going to come in.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch07note59" id="ch07note59"><sup>59</sup></a></p>
<p class="noindent">In other words when banks come collecting on debts some of these cannot be repaid because corporate investments overshot “effective demand.” Others are exposed as speculations gone bust or fraudulent Ponzi schemes.</p>
<p class="indent">Marx’s analysis did not, of course, encompass today’s particular alphabet soup of complex derivatives, which did not exist during his day. But the overall point stands: the 2007 to 2009 crisis appeared first at the outer layers of the economy—credit, financialization, and monetary policies. Below the surface, the roots of the Great Recession lay in an overproduction of goods and an overaccumulation of capital, itself the result of the neoliberal boom. <small>NEOLIBERALISM</small> ushered in a period of financial deregulation; but it also played a corresponding role in rehabilitating the system’s profitability and heating up production levels.</p>
<p class="indent">Neoliberalism was the ruling elite’s answer to the system’s last deep recession—in the 1970s—of declining profitability, rising inflation, and slow growth. In one short decade, from 1973 to 1982, the United States went through three recessions. In response, a concerted restructuring of the economy along free-market principles ushered in a twenty-five-year-long boom that restored profitability with a vengeance. As socialist writer Lee Sustar described it:</p>
<p class="block">The capitalist solution to this crisis was to go back to market fundamentals. Economists like Milton Friedman, for decades seen as a right-wing crank, were suddenly promoted as sages for preaching deregulation of business, privatization of government services and “flexible” labor policies. Politicians like Ronald Reagan in the US and Margaret Thatcher in Britain turned Friedman’s ideas into policies by smashing unions, slashing government spending and turning finance capital loose. The Clinton administration shaved off some of the rough edges of these policies, but basically consolidated what is now known as “neoliberalism.”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch07note60" id="ch07note60"><sup>60</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_212"/>The ideology of neoliberalism thus served as a blueprint to attack the working class. Speedups, increased productivity, and declining wages transferred wealth from the bottom rungs of society to the top. Social costs were meanwhile passed on to working families through cuts to public services and welfare. The desired outcome of this restructuring was growing profitability for the ruling class alongside staggering inequality. Over the course of three decades, the wealthiest 1 percent nearly doubled its share of national earnings; while over a quarter of the population came to live on poverty wages, producing a society as unequal as the one which preceded the Great Depression.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch07note61" id="ch07note61"><sup>61</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">A heightened rate of exploitation laid the basis for business to boom again. And the deregulation that let loose the capitalist funhouse of financialization poured fuel on the fire. By the 1990s, happy commentators declared a “miracle economy,” which would put an end to the business cycle. From 1991 to 2001, the US economy witnessed its longest-ever continual expansion. Gross Domestic Product grew, profits doubled, unemployment fell, and even wages began to rise—a miracle indeed. But the twin features of neoliberalism—economic polarization and deregulation—gave rise to contradictions that would implode down the line: overaccumulation, mountains of debt, and soaring speculative bubbles.</p>
<p class="indent">Rapid accumulation gave way to overproduction. This came to a head in the late 1990s, in what became known as the Asian financial crisis. A global glut of goods first appeared in Southeast Asia. For years the poster child of the free market, billions of dollars’ worth of international loans and investments fueled high, export-driven growth rates. Overly-optimistic investors inundated the region with loans, vastly increasing the productive capacity of local economies but with little regard to the market’s capacity to absorb the amount of goods being produced.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch07note62" id="ch07note62"><sup>62</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">Beginning in the 1990s, investment levels had risen throughout the region.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch07note63" id="ch07note63"><sup>63</sup></a> China’s particularly rapid industrial growth in the middle of the decade tipped the scales towards overproduction. When markets proved incapable of absorbing the increased output, production started to slow—factories operated at capacities between 60 and 75 percent. Even so, the river of international investments kept rushing forward. But falling exports eventually led to defaults in loan repayments. When they did, the river of capital reversed course. Just as quickly as it had rushed in, and investors attempted to withdraw capital as financial panic spread.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch07note64" id="ch07note64"><sup>64</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_213"/>The crisis was global in nature. Much of the world was mired in conditions of recession or depression, as currencies and banking systems collapsed, world trade declined, rates of profit tumbled, and industry limped along. But the impact of the crisis was largely checked—or at least postponed—in the United States. Here the spigot of credit kept flowing through low interest rates set by the Federal Reserve Bank, trade deficits, and tax cuts to corporations. Essentially the market for commodities—both the means of production and consumptive goods—was extended as corporations and consumers borrowed more to spend more.</p>
<p class="indent">Piling up consumer, corporate, and state debts allowed the US to become the “buyer of last resort” of goods from other countries as well. Thus American (over)spending came to play a large role in pulling the world out of recession, propping up global production by generating demand. From 1997 to 2000, the yearly value of goods and services imported to the US jumped from just over a trillion dollars (at 2017 value) to almost $1.5 trillion.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch07note65" id="ch07note65"><sup>65</sup></a> During this time China’s economy experienced an Industrial Revolution and double-digit annual growth rates. This in turn allowed a growing market in China to absorb output from the rest of the globe.</p>
<p class="indent">In short, US debt undergirded a global expansion of production and the realization of extraordinary profits, despite never resolving the worldwide glut of goods. The United States federal budget surplus was at its high of $236 billion in 2000 and flipped to a deficit of over $300 billion by 2005.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch07note66" id="ch07note66"><sup>66</sup></a> During those same years, a trade deficit also ballooned from $373 billion to $714 billion.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch07note67" id="ch07note67"><sup>67</sup></a> Along with huge budgetary and trade deficits, asset bubbles grew throughout the 1990s and 2000s.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch07note68" id="ch07note68"><sup>68</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">Throughout the 2000s, notwithstanding a mild recession in 2001, the engine of growth kept going, powered by debt. Businesses took in trillions of dollars of loans from banks and tapped into the vast “shadow banking” system. Working class debt allowed production to barrel ahead at great speeds, despite declining incomes that would otherwise have limited the market for consumer goods. Household debt during the peak of the boom was 120 percent of personal income. (By way of comparison, it was 31 percent during the post-World War II boom, and had climbed to 81 percent by 2000.)<a href="19_bm006.html#ch07note69" id="ch07note69"><sup>69</sup></a></p>

<p class="indent">Yet even as the economy expanded through the 2000s, capital investment in new plants and means of production was slow, as industries were still grappling with unresolved issues of overproduction from the 1990s. There was no incentive to build new factories while existing factories were still functioning at partial capacity. Even at the height of the boom in 2005, capacity utilization barely hovered at 80 percent, significantly lower than previous booms.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch07note70" id="ch07note70"><sup>70</sup></a> “Capitalists invested internationally or in high-profit US industries like finance and real estate, but did not pour money into developing new production technologies domestically.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch07note71" id="ch07note71"><sup>71</sup></a></p>
<p class="h3">HOUSING BUBBLES OVER</p>
<p class="noindent">It was in this context that investment flowed heavily to a profitable housing industry, and with it swelled a bubble of extraordinary proportions. Low interest rates for mortgages put home ownership in reach to a wider-than-ever layer of people despite rising real estate prices. The low teaser rates of subprime loans helped drive demand. Working people were led to believe that property values would continue to rise indefinitely and that they would be able to refinance their loans before the higher rates built into subprime mortgages set in.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_215"/>Meanwhile, investor demand for mortgage-backed securities incentivized banks to extend evermore mortgages, slice them up, repackage and resell them, collecting fees hand over fist in the process. Banks pushed these predatory loans hard: subprime mortgages rose from 8 percent in 2003 to at least 20 percent of mortgages by 2005.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch07note72" id="ch07note72"><sup>72</sup></a> At the height of the housing boom, between 2004 and 2006, banks, thrifts, credit unions, and mortgage companies issued over 10 million high-interest mortgage loans, generating a combined total of $1.5 trillion of toxic debt.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch07note73" id="ch07note73"><sup>73</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">Along with the frenzied flurry of mortgage lending, the activity of speculators also drove up demand for houses, and therefore their prices. Speculators used subprime mortgages to buy up as much property as they could. Because these loans didn’t necessitate putting down much money upfront, they were able to continue to buy housing even while prices rose. Ironically, while poor and working-class people were being blamed for causing the housing crisis through nonpayment of loans, investors were among the first to default on their loans when housing prices began to fall. (See sidebar: “Who’s to Blame for the Subprime Mortgage Crisis?”) Because they didn’t live in those homes, they had very little interest in holding on to bad debt. Investors were responsible for more than a quarter of seriously delinquent mortgage balances, according to the New York Fed blog, <em>Liberty Street Economics</em>.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch07note74" id="ch07note74"><sup>74</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">While the bubble grew and grew, so too did the delusions of those that benefited from it. In 2005, at the peak of the bubble, the appraised value of homes made up 145 percent of gross domestic product. Just at this moment, Frank Nothaft, chief economist at mortgage company Freddie Mac told <em>Business Week</em>, “I don’t foresee any national decline in home price values. Freddie Mac’s analysis of single-family houses over the last half century hasn’t shown a single year when the national average housing price has gone down.”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch07note75" id="ch07note75"><sup>75</sup></a> Meanwhile, David Lereah of the National Association of Realtors (NAR) distributed “Anti-Bubble Reports” to “respond to the irresponsible bubble accusations made by your local media and local academics.” Readers were assured: “There is virtually no risk of a national housing price bubble based on the fundamental demand for housing and predictable economic factors.”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch07note76" id="ch07note76"><sup>76</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">But a bubble it was. As it grew, it also encouraged heavier debt loads, as working-class people squeezed for cash used their homes as collateral for more credit, and banks went on a lending spree to take advantage of the superprofits being made. The <em>Economist</em> described this process in 2008. It is worth quoting at length:</p>
<p class="block"><a id="page_216"/>An important reason why the American economy has been so resilient and recessions so mild since 1982 is the energy of consumers. Their spending has been remarkably stable, not only because drops in employment and income have been less severe than of old, but also because they have been willing and able to borrow. The long rise in asset prices—first of stocks, then of houses—raised consumers’ net worth and made saving seem less necessary. And borrowing became easier, thanks to financial innovation and lenders’ relaxed underwriting, which was itself based on the supposedly reliable collateral of ever-more-valuable houses. On average, consumers from 1950 to 1985 saved 9% of their disposable income. That saving rate then steadily declined, to around zero earlier this year. At the same time, consumer and mortgage debts rose to 127% of disposable income, from 77% in 1990.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch07note77" id="ch07note77"><sup>77</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">But this was an unsustainable state of affairs. Surging real estate prices and interest rates eventually put home ownership out of reach from the working class and undercut effective demand for new homes. As sales started to plummet, falling demand dragged down housing prices, and along with it home equity. Banks had dangled the prospects of home ownership to America’s poor, and now came knocking down their doors for debt repayment. A tipping point arrived to turn bubble to bust.</p>
<p class="indent">You don’t have to be a Marxist to see that skyrocketing real estate prices and stagnating incomes wouldn’t add up to anything good. Analysts at Harvard University’s Joint Center for Housing Studies described the state of housing in a 2008 paper. The paper is worth quoting at length, as it describes a classic case of overproduction, straight from the establishment’s elite corridors:</p>
<p class="blocka">[E]ven lax lending standards and innovative mortgage products could not keep housing markets going indefinitely. With interest rates on the rise starting in 2004, price appreciation showed signs of weakening in late 2005. Investors quickly exited markets and homebuyers lost their sense of urgency. But builders had ramped up to meet the higher level of demand from investors as well as buyers of first and second homes, pushing single-family starts [construction of housing units] from 1.3 million in 2001 to 1.7 million in 2005. Just as housing demand started to abate, record numbers of new single-family homes were coming on the market or were in the pipeline.</p>
<p class="block1">With excess supplies beginning to mount and the temporary lift from mortgage product innovations coming to an end, nominal house prices finally turned down on a year-over-year basis in the third quarter of 2006. Meanwhile, interest rates on some adjustable loans began to reset and mortgage performance deteriorated as poor risk management practices took their toll. Lenders responded by tightening credit in the second half of 2007, dragging the market down even more sharply and exacerbating the threat of a prolonged housing downturn.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch07note78" id="ch07note78"><sup>78</sup></a></p>
<p class="noindent1"><a id="page_217"/>Thus an overheated housing market gave way to mortgage defaults and vacant homes, which then (as supply overtook demand) put a downward pressure on housing prices. Cancellations of construction projects skyrocketed. In 2007 alone, over 200,000 construction jobs were lost.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch07note79" id="ch07note79"><sup>79</sup></a> But as noted in the previous chapter, a significant time lag existed between the time in which the market was saturated and levels of production adjusted. This lag was exacerbated by layers of financial cocktails, several steps removed from the production of homes. By the end of 2007, the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> could report:</p>
<p class="block">Housing peaked in 2005. By early 2006 it was widely recognized the boom was likely over, and by mid-2006 it was beyond question. In June 2006, sales of existing single-family homes were 9% below their year-earlier level, sales of new homes were down 15% and framing lumber prices were down 19%. The Dow Jones Wilshire index of home-building shares had fallen 41% from its July 2005 peak. Yet throughout 2006, the folks who financed the housing bubble turned up the volume on their party. Issuance of collateralized debt obligations—investments that held heaps of risky mortgage securities and other asset-backed securities—hit $187 billion in 2006, according to Dealogic. That was up 72% from 2005.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch07note80" id="ch07note80"><sup>80</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">Inevitably the reality of overproduction would catch up with the delusions of finance. Mass delinquencies left mortgage fees, which had been at the heart of complex Wall Street cocktails, unpaid. The “fictitious capital,” in Marx’s words, behind mortgage-backed securities was exposed as completely toxic. Defaults on mortgages turned financial cocktails sour. As foreclosures nearly doubled to a million by the end of 2007, the “dominoes of debt began to fall,” as Lee Sustar put it.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch07note81" id="ch07note81"><sup>81</sup></a> Or in the words of Marx, “The chain of payment obligations,” suddenly broke “in a hundred places.”</p>
<p class="indent">Demand for mortgage-backed securities dropped off so quickly that investors were forced to sell them at a loss. The declining prices of homes in turn decreased home equity against which workers could borrow money and put a tighter squeeze on consumer spending. Writing at the end of 2008, the <em>Economist</em> described: “House values have fallen 18% since their peak in 2006. Banks and other lenders have tightened lending standards on all types of consumer loans. As a consequence, consumer spending fell at a 3.1% annual rate in the third quarter…. The golden age of spending for the American consumer has ended and a new age of thrift likely has begun.”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch07note82" id="ch07note82"><sup>82</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_218"/>The hyperextension of debt and the inflation of the value of homes and other assets was a phenomenon that occurred throughout the financial system. It was merely at its weakest point—the subprime market—where the contradictions first came to a head. But the depth of the crisis quickly became clear. What began in the US subprime mortgage market became a global financial credit crunch, as capitalists were forced to reckon with the fact that assets of all types were overvalued. Stock prices crashed. Commercial real estate cratered. Over-indebted companies were unable to access sufficient cash. Many firms found that even funding day-to-day operations became impossible without the functioning of capital markets. The system itself was pushed to the brink of collapse, and only a herculean, internationally coordinated series of bailouts was able to keep the financial system from imploding entirely.</p>
<p class="indent">The multi-trillion-dollar bailouts came at a great price, through austerity measures forced on working class and poor people around the world. Meanwhile massive rounds of layoffs, cutbacks, and deactivation of facilities resulted in skyrocketing unemployment and a sizable drop in production around the world. The crisis created by Wall Street and financial institutions led to a devastating recession for working people.</p>
<p class="h3">THE STATE AND FINANCE</p>
<p class="noindent">In the wake of the financial meltdown, states made vast sums of public funds available to the financial system in the form of bailouts, loans and, in some cases, nationalizations. In the United States, a $700-billion-dollar bailout of the banks known as Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) sparked mass outrage when it first passed. But TARP was just the tip of the iceberg. More than 30 programs overseen by the Treasury Department and Federal Reserve paid, loaned, insured, or reserved money to bail out Wall Street.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch07note83" id="ch07note83"><sup>83</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">The actual size of the bailout is unknown, since it is still ongoing, but estimates range from $14 trillion to twice that amount.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch07note84" id="ch07note84"><sup>84</sup></a> As Matt Taibbi wrote for <em>Rolling Stone</em>: “What we actually ended up doing was… committing American taxpayers to permanent, blind support of an ungovernable, unregulatable, hyperconcentrated new financial system that exacerbates the greed and inequality that caused the crash, and forces Wall Street banks like Goldman Sachs and Citigroup to increase risk rather than reduce it.”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch07note85" id="ch07note85"><sup>85</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">The Treasury Department and Federal Reserve took large volumes of bad debts onto their books directly, relieving pressure on banks and other institutions. Shaken by the disastrous shock to the economy delivered by Lehman Brothers’ (previously the fourth largest investment bank in the US) bankruptcy, governments made it clear that large institutions deemed “too big to fail” would be saved by the state. As a consequence, this also incentivized further consolidation since size has meant safety—encouraging strong banks to take over weaker ones.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_219"/>Around the world, states mounted stimulus spending packages to help prop economies, but only by buying bad debt and shoring up banks. Public intervention to promote production and reduce unemployment was not mounted, nor were homeowners assisted with their debts.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch07note86" id="ch07note86"><sup>86</sup></a> In the US, the amount of money spent bailing out Wall Street could have paid off every mortgage in the country. Instead, bailouts, guarantees, assumption of bad debts, and pressures on state revenues resulted in a rapid turn to austerity measures as government debts quickly mounted. The cost of the bailout and recession was in this way passed on to workers in the form of cutbacks in state spending and payrolls, and reductions in pensions. Perversely, the same banks that benefited from the state’s largesse began demanding higher interest rates in bond markets to fund new state borrowing.</p>
<p class="indent">In keeping with neoliberal principles, the US government rescued the financial system without violating the concept of private ownership of the system. In the wake of the crisis, when financial reform entered political discussion, banks and their lobbyists succeeded in dictating the terms of the debate, resulting in largely preserving the status quo. Capitalists that had railed against state regulation were perfectly happy for state intervention to prop up their businesses’ bottom lines. Privatize the gains and socialize the losses, was the name of the game. As socialist Eric Ruder argued:</p>
<p class="block">Now that those investments have become toxic, however, the push for deregulation has been replaced—for all but the most ideologically blinkered—by the gospel of state intervention. “The goal is to get the engine of capitalism going as productively as possible,” Nancy Koehn, a historian at the Harvard Business School, told the <em>New York Times</em>. “Ideology is a luxury good in times of crisis.” The bailout of various financial firms and nationalization of the banks, however, is nothing more than a way to use the taxes paid by the working class to “socialize” the losses incurred by Wall Street’s gamblers—ironically, the very same bankers and speculators whose multimillion-dollar paychecks are defended by free-market apologists as deserved compensation for their unique ability to make wise decisions.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch07note87" id="ch07note87"><sup>87</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_220"/>The trillions of dollars mobilized by federal officials to bail out banks following the financial implosion in 2007 to 2008 highlights an important point: the state is not a neutral body overlooking the social health of its population. Rather, as Marx and Engels wrote: “The executive of the modern state is but a committee for managing the common affairs of the whole bourgeoisie.”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch07note88" id="ch07note88"><sup>88</sup></a> At times, this means letting the free market rip, at other times it means stepping in to prop up banks and industries. There may be tactical debates within the ruling class about which approach to take, and at times of deep economic crisis they may experience deadlock or uncertainty when the status quo become discredited. But thus far the ruling class has never found a crisis it wasn’t able to get out of—by making the working class pay for it.</p>
<p class="indent">Governments use fiscal policy (government spending and taxation) along with monetary policy (the cost and availability of credit, in the case of the US set by its central bank, the Federal Reserve) to intervene in the economy. Central banks determine interest-rate policy and guarantee a portion of bank deposits. By dictating the cost of capital, central banks can influence financial activity. And by ensuring that depositors do not lose their money in the event of a bank bankruptcy, they prevent runs on bank deposits the likes of which occurred during the Great Depression.</p>
<p class="indent">In this sense, there has never been a truly “free market” that acts with no state mediation. But fiscal and monetary policies can only impact the economy in a limited way because the underlying principal of production and capital accumulation is unplanned. This was proven all too true by Ben Bernanke who in 2005 declared, “history proves … that a smart central bank can protect the economy and the financial sector from the nastier side effects of a stock market collapse.”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch07note89" id="ch07note89"><sup>89</sup></a> Two years later, as chair of the Federal Reserve, he failed to do just that.</p>
<p class="h3">A TOOL FOR IMPERIALISM</p>
<p class="noindent">Among the most important roles that the state plays in “managing the affairs” of the ruling class is to act on behalf of the capitalist class abroad. Finance is a central weapon toward that end. In “good times” the extension of credit is used as a tool for imperialist countries to control the economies of developing nations. Institutions like the IMF and World Bank are wielded to impose policies that undermine autonomous economic development and favor hyper-exploitative conditions to the benefit of first-world based multinationals. In the lead up to the Great Recession, many nations were in effect required to carry dollar reserves in order to protect their currencies. The result is a net tax on developing nations benefiting the United States as issuer of fiat world money.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_221"/>In “bad times” states with stronger economies are able to impose devastating austerity measures on weaker states, as Eurogroup ministers have done in subjecting the moribund Greek economy to the priorities of Europe’s bankers and bosses. Greece’s problems originated in EU “rescue” plans following the Great Recession, which resulted in unemployment rates of more than 25 percent, a 30 percent drop in real wages, and a shrinking of the country’s overall economic output by 25 percent between 2009 and 2015. Successive EU “bailouts” of the Greek economy have allowed European banks to get repaid, forced unforgiving austerity measures on Greece’s already suffering working class, and delivered a clear message to other struggling European countries of what awaits them if they don’t keep their economies in line.</p>
<p class="indent">Historically, just as finance played a critical role in the development of capitalism, so too it has always been a necessary tool for imperialism. Rosa Luxemburg powerfully captured the process by which the “Great Powers” used loans to subjugate colonies during the nineteenth century and destroy local economies. In <em>The Accumulation of Capital</em>, Luxemburg recounts the way Egypt was opened up to the ravages of European industrialists first through loans from Britain and France to finance the construction of the Suez Canal and to develop cotton production. “These operations of capital,” wrote Luxemburg, “at first sight, seem to reach the height of madness. One loan followed hard on the other, the interest on old loans was defrayed by new loans, and capital borrowed from the British and French paid for the large orders placed with British and French industrial capital.”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch07note90" id="ch07note90"><sup>90</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">The high cost of the interest on these loans was paid for through the land, labor, and tax payments of the Egyptian peasants (or fellahs). Luxemburg wrote:</p>
<p class="blocka">The greater the debt to European capital became, the more had to be extorted from the peasants … All over Upper Egypt people were leaving the villages, demolished their dwellings and no longer tilled their land—only to avoid payment of taxes … North of Siut, 10,000 fellaheen are said to have starved in 1879 because they could no longer raise the irrigation tax for their fields and had killed their cattle to avoid paying tax on it.</p>
<p class="block1">Now the fellah had been drained of his last drop of blood. Used as a leech by European capital, the Egyptian state had accomplished its function and was no longer needed … Now British commissions to ‘regulate’ the finances of Egypt went into action. Strangely enough, European capital was not at all deterred by the desperate state of the insolvent country and offered again and again to grant immense loans for the salvation of Egypt … With the financial position growing hopelessly desperate, the time drew near when the country and all her productive forces was to become the prey of European capital. October 1878 saw the representatives of the European creditors landing in Alexandria. British and French capital established dual control of finances and devised new taxes; the peasants were beaten and oppressed, so that payment of interest, temporarily suspended in 1876, could be resumed in 1877.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch07note91" id="ch07note91"><sup>91</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent1"><a id="page_222"/>Having seized control of the country’s finances, military control was quickly to follow. By decade’s end, hundreds of thousands of acres were taken by Britain as collateral for public debt. A mutiny in the Egyptian army provided a pretext for invasion. “The British military occupied Egypt in 1882, as a result of twenty years’ operations of Big Business, never to leave again.” Luxemburg continued: “This was the ultimate and final step in the process of liquidating peasant economy in Egypt by and for European capital… Stripped of all obscuring connecting links, these relations consist in the simple fact that European capital has largely swallowed up the Egyptian peasant economy. Enormous tracts of land, labor, and labor products without number, accruing to the state as taxes, have ultimately been converted into European capital and have been accumulated.”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch07note92" id="ch07note92"><sup>92</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">United States’ imperial ambitions followed closely on the heels of European colonialism. Throughout the nineteenth century, US banks floated unfavorable loans to Caribbean countries and sent in the Marines when payments were delinquent. In the early twentieth century American forces entered Haiti first through the National City Bank. Then when the Haitian government refused to cede power of its customs houses to the bank, the Marines invaded.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch07note93" id="ch07note93"><sup>93</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">By the time anti-colonial movements in the Global South won formal independence in the years following World War II, policies which had purposefully underdeveloped their economies and pillaged their resources ensured that new states would remain subordinate to the former colonial powers. The “Great Powers” had turned entire regions into suppliers of single commodity exports while systematically stunting or destroying the infrastructure for internal growth. When ex-colonies set to developing their own economies, they by and large had to request credit from the same countries that had looted their resources and subjugated their markets.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_223"/>In the 1970s, Third World debt had reached nearly half a trillion dollars. And when spikes in interest rates made it impossible to repay the debts, the IMF and World Bank—institutions set up to serve the interests of the US and other global powers—stepped in to manage the debts. They did so by enforcing “structural adjustment programs”—loan conditions which typically impose brutal austerity measures and privatization schemes, and pry open developing nations to multinationals through “special economic zones” that exploit cheap labor. Along with these policies, “debt for equity” swaps have allowed creditors to claim assets or resources in exchange for delinquent debts. It seemed that colonialism had only found a new form.</p>
<p class="indent">Today the Global South is drowning in debt. Despite astronomical sums spent on debt repayments, their financial obligations keep growing. Large parts of their budgets are allocated to just servicing the interest on their debts. As David McNally described: “Between 1980 and 2002, the developing countries made $4.6 trillion in debt payments. This represents about eight times what they owed at the beginning of the period (580 billion in 1980). Yet, after making these payments, thanks to the magic of interest, they now owed $2.4 trillion.”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch07note94" id="ch07note94"><sup>94</sup></a> The social cost of servicing these debts is in of itself a crime, leading to sky-high infant mortality rates and death rates due to curable diseases such as malaria and tuberculosis. Approximately 800,000 Africans died of AIDS in 2015. Meanwhile, payments to service the billions of dollars’ worth of interest on debts continue.</p>
<p class="indent">Mozambique, one of the poorest nations in the world, holds public debt equal to 70 percent of its GDP. Over 60 percent of it is owed to foreign institutions.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch07note95" id="ch07note95"><sup>95</sup></a> The so-called “emerging markets” became a popular investment destination for speculators searching for high-yield returns. They readily lapped up a record of $1.4 trillion worth of debt from emerging markets’ governments and companies. But when prices of commodities produced in the Global South fell, booming growth slowed, and speculators responded by pulling back investments and calling in debts. Economies were left in a tailspin, or sunk in a deep depression.</p>
<p class="indent">Of course, full on, old-fashioned colonialism still operates in the US colony of Puerto Rico. To this day Puerto Rico is under the economic and political control of Washington DC, without even a pretext of democratic representation.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch07note96" id="ch07note96"><sup>96</sup></a> Systematic economic underdevelopment has ensured that Puerto Rico has to import 85 percent of its food (mostly from the US).

<p class="indent"><a id="page_224"/>Following the Great Recession, Puerto Rico became known as the “Greece of the Caribbean.” The extent to which its economy went into a free fall was prescribed by two decades of neoliberal austerity and privatization measures, and the racking up of billions of dollars’ worth of international debt. Puerto Rico is unable to access loans from the IMF and World Bank, and instead relies heavily on infamously parasitic hedge funds, which according to the watchdog site Hedgeclippers.org, have swooped in like vultures “during a fast-moving economic crisis to prey on the vulnerable island.” The watchdog site explained:</p>
<p class="block">Several groups of hedge funds and billionaire hedge fund managers have bought up large chunks of Puerto Rican debt at discounts, pushed the island to borrow more, and are driving towards devastating austerity measures. At the same time, they are also using the island as a tax haven … They are fueling inequality by demanding low taxes on wealthy investors, higher taxes on working people, lower wages, harsh service cuts and privatization of public schools … The spoils they ultimately seek are not just bond payments, but structural reforms and privatization schemes that give them extraordinary wealth and power—at the expense of everyone else.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch07note97" id="ch07note97"><sup>97</sup></a></p>
<p class="h3">CONCLUSION</p>
<p class="noindent">The neoliberal restructuring of the economy has led to seismic shifts in the world of finance. So much so that at times it has appeared that finance capital possessed magical powers to escape the limitations of the productive economy. If financial capital has become detached from productive capitalism, this raises fundamental questions about Marx’s law of value. Can surplus value be created outside of production and the exploitation of labor? In the words of French sociologist Jean Baudrillard, money has become “utterly detached from production and its conditions,” and we are experiencing: “The end of labor. The end of production. The end of political economy.”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch07note98" id="ch07note98"><sup>98</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">Yet to pose these questions assumes a divide between the “real” economy of industrial capital, which engages in the production and selling of goods, but has little capital of its own from which to seed this activity, and of finance capital, which plays a purely facilitating role in circulation. In reality there is no hard line between financial and non-financial firms. Quite the contrary: the last few decades have witnessed an increasing overlap and merging of productive and financial capital. Non-financial firms have had greater access and connectivity to financial markets. “In practice,” argued Demophanes Papadatos,</p>
<p class="block"><a id="page_225"/>borrowing capitalists typically possess some of their own capital plus some that they borrow. Second, revenue in the form of interest tends also to accrue to industrial and commercial capitalists, and it is not the exclusive foundation of a separate social group, such as financial capitalists. The separate and often opposing interests of lending and borrowing capitalists cannot be fully analyzed in terms of the functioning-industrial section of the capitalist class confronting the financial-moneyed section.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch07note99" id="ch07note99"><sup>99</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">Financial and industrial capital are completely interdependent. The experience of the Great Recession proved, rather than refuted, this point when the very real and concrete market for homes hit its limit and brought wild financial dreams back down to earth in a devastating crash. Still, the relative strength of finance vis-à-vis industrial capital has given increased momentum to arguments that we are in a “post-industrial” phase of capitalism, such as has been popularized by post-Marxist philosophers Antonio Negri and Michael Hardt; or that we are in a stagnant stage of the system, propped up only by ongoing investment in finance, as is the editorial line held by the <em>Monthly Review</em> since the 1970s.</p>
<p class="indent">Current <em>Monthly Review</em> editor John Bellamy Foster has dubbed this phase of capitalism as “monopoly-finance.” He has argued: “financialization has become a permanent structural necessity of the stagnation-prone economy… Stagnation and enormous financial speculation emerged as symbiotic aspects of the same deep-seated, irreversible economic impasse.”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch07note100" id="ch07note100"><sup>100</sup></a> The argument goes that capitalists are no longer able to find a sufficient rate of return in industrial production and are therefore increasingly dependent on finance capital as a means to increase capital. But since finance capital cannot, in the end, expand indefinitely without a base in the productive economy, we are prone to both speculative bubbles and spectacular busts.</p>
<p class="indent">In fact, the massive investment in financial cocktails was the product of an <em>opposite</em> trend. So much profitability had been restored through neoliberal restructuring that capital needed additional outlets for investment. Since the 1970s tremendous material growth in production and output has taken place, most dramatically in China, but throughout other regions of the world as well. Rather than a permanent state of stagnation intermittently propped up with new financial innovations, we see continual dynamism and growth—at the expense of the world’s poor and working class.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_226"/>Despite the outrageous and grotesque growth of finance capital in the economy today, capitalism, as McNally has argued, “still depends on exploiting labor in workplaces—be it cleaners in office towers, farm workers in fields, data processors in packed cubicles, sewing machine operators in back street sweatshops, or autoworkers on giant assembly lines.”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch07note101" id="ch07note101"><sup>101</sup></a> Profits cannot be created without the exploitation of labor at the point of production, even if large sums are traded and lost.</p>
<p class="indent">Financialization quickly generated spectacular sums of <em>fictitious</em> capital—promises of future profits—along with plentiful fees for the many hands involved in the transactions. The fictitious nature of this new capital only became clear when the value promised melted away, causing the bizarre appearance and disappearance of trillions of dollars seemingly overnight. “This fictitious money capital,” explained Marx, “is enormously reduced during crisis, and with it the power of its owners to borrow money in the market. The reduction of the money value of these securities… has nothing to do with the real capital they represent. As against this, it has a lot to do with the solvency of their owners.”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch07note102" id="ch07note102"><sup>102</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">Despite specific developments that Marx could not have foreseen, the evolution and explosion of the financial sector is consistent with classical Marxist economic analysis. Finance capital has surely reached a new phase in its size and strength. But its presence—and its seemingly mystical qualities—has existed for as long as modern industry. Many years before the days of the toxic alphabet soup of CDOs, CDSs, and SIVs—Marx could write about a “new financial aristocracy, a new variety of parasites in the shape of promoters, speculators and simply nominal directors; a whole system of swindling and cheating by means of corporation promotion, stock issuance and stock speculation.”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch07note103" id="ch07note103"><sup>103</sup></a></p>

<p class="box-head">WHO’S TO BLAME FOR THE SUBPRIME MORTGAGE CRISIS?</p>
<p class="noindent">When the subprime market went bust, the common trope from mainstream commentators was that poor and working-class people, who should not have been able to afford homeownership, irresponsibly took out mortgages that they could not pay back. Somehow we were expected to believe that poor people cheated or pressured banks to make these loans to them. A somewhat more oblique version of the same argument placed the blame on the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA), which was passed in 1977 to address discriminatory loan practices known as “redlining” (whereby banks would not lend within African American and Latinx neighborhoods).</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_227"/><em>Washington Post</em> columnist Charles Krauthammer, for instance, wrote:</p>
<p class="block">Much of this crisis was brought upon us by the good intentions of good people. For decades, starting with Jimmy Carter’s Community Reinvestment Act of 1977, there has been bipartisan agreement to use government power to expand homeownership to people who had been shut out for economic reasons or, sometimes, because of racial and ethnic discrimination. What could be a more worthy cause? But it led to tremendous pressure on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac—which in turn pressured banks and other lenders—to extend mortgages to people who were borrowing over their heads. That’s called subprime lending. It lies at the root of our current calamity.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch07note104" id="ch07note104"><sup>104</sup></a></p>
<p class="noindent">This line turns reality on its head. First, the CRA never mandated loose lending requirements or extortionary, rising interest rates. The problem was not that the goal of expanding home-ownership put too much pressure on banks and the state, but rather that without a strong commitment to enforcing anti-discrimination in housing, the legislative efforts of the CRA could not go far enough.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch07note105" id="ch07note105"><sup>105</sup></a> Nor was it the case that subprime borrowers were necessarily too poor to afford to buy homes. Well over half of subprime mortgages went to people who had credit scores high enough to obtain conventional loans.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch07note106" id="ch07note106"><sup>106</sup></a> But more importantly even if they <em>couldn’t</em> afford the loans, and dared to dream of homeownership anyway, that was certainly not their fault. Blame lies with a system that is based on low-wage and precarious labor, where people work hard all their lives, and still find that basic needs like decent shelter are luxuries for the rich.</p>
<p class="indent">Instead banks preyed upon the dreams of working-class people, and took advantage of their vulnerable and weak bargaining positions to drive millions of prospective homeowners toward subprime loans. This was not because poor people demanded risky, high-interest loans, but because Wall Street did. A ferocious appetite for high-yielding, mortgage-backed securities put pressure on banks and other mortgage lenders to turn over more and more high-risk loans. As Ira Rheingold of the National Association of Consumer Advocates put it: “Wall Street wanted the mortgage brokers to keep making loans even though they were riskier and riskier. They didn’t care that … people were getting loans they couldn’t afford because there was so much money to be made.”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch07note107" id="ch07note107"><sup>107</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_228"/>Frances Darden, a disabled mother of three from Boston “long dreamt of owning her own home,” reported the <em>Financial Times:</em></p>
<p class="block">Several banks turned her down for a mortgage because she did not earn enough. She was starting to give up hope. But in September 2004, an advertisement in the local newspaper for a home buyers’ seminar caught her eye. “It was so appealing,” she recalls. “It said: ‘You can afford your dream home. Let’s make history.̵7” … She says the agent encouraged her to buy a multi-family property, where she could become not only homeowner but landlady as well. At that time, her monthly income was made up of not much more than $1,800 in disability payments, a small amount of child support and a modest rent subsidy. Much to her surprise, Ms. Darden was “preapproved” for a loan worth $894,000. “When they told me, I couldn’t believe it. But they said: ‘We’re different from everyone else, we can help you.̵7” Ms. Darden put no money down. She says she was assured that her monthly repayments would be $5,000 and that rental income would fully cover those costs—and put money in her pocket to boot. As it turned out, the repayments were more than $7,500 a month. The annual interest rate was 11.7 percent, nearly double the level a creditworthy borrower would be charged. By November the following year she had fallen hopelessly behind on her mortgage. One flat in the two-unit house she had bought was foreclosed on and sold. The other is soon to go to auction.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch07note108" id="ch07note108"><sup>108</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">Rather than being the culprits of the housing market, poor and working-class families were its victims, roped into predatory loan agreements with growing interest rates that could not be maintained on stagnating wages. And this was particularly true of Blacks and Latinxs, who had been kept out of home ownership through racist redlining policies for decades. When money was to be made off of this same population, racial exclusion gave way to “predatory inclusion,” as African American Studies Professor and writer Keeanga-Yamahtta Taylor put it, granting access to financing but at unequal terms. “Racism and the economic exploitation of African Americans was the glue that held the American housing market together and would necessarily need to be overcome to fully include Black buyers in the real estate market. But inclusion did not bring an end to predacious practices; it intensified them.”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch07note109" id="ch07note109"><sup>109</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_229"/>Of course it can’t be said that African Americans and Latinxs were “formerly” excluded from homeownership. A 2018 study by Reveal News showed that modern-day redlining is alive and well across the country. An analysis of 31 million Home Mortgage Disclosure Act records found that Blacks and Latinxs are denied mortgage loans of <em>any kind</em> at rates far higher than whites in 61 metropolitan areas “even when controlling for applicants’ income, loan amount and neighborhood.”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch07note110" id="ch07note110"><sup>110</sup></a> The report explained: “The disproportionate denials and limited antidiscrimination enforcement help explain why the homeownership gap between whites and African Americans, which had been shrinking since the 1970s, has exploded since the housing bust. It is now wider than it was during the Jim Crow era.”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch07note111" id="ch07note111"><sup>111</sup></a> In Washington DC, JP Morgan Chase granted 23 out of 1,119 home purchase loans to African Americans in 2015 to 2016. In Philadelphia, banks placed “nearly three-quarters of their branches in white-majority neighborhoods,” keeping any type of financial service literally out of reach.</p>
<p class="indent">Yet where people of color have been able to secure loans, it has been at great and extortionary—subprime—costs. A study conducted by a group of fair housing agencies found that in every major city, Blacks and Latinxs were many times more likely to land subprime mortgages than their white counterparts with similar incomes. In greater Boston, for instance, “71 percent of blacks earning above $153,000 in 2005 took out mortgages with high interest rates, compared to just 9.4 percent of whites, while about 70 percent of black and Hispanic borrowers with incomes between $92,000 and $152,000 received high-interest rate home loans, compared to 17 percent for whites.”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch07note112" id="ch07note112"><sup>112</sup></a> Cassandra Hedges, a Black mother of two explained: “One of the first things my broker asked me was ‘How do you know you are ready to buy a house. Have you done any research?’ We said ‘No’. At that point I think he realized ‘Okay I got some people that don’t know what the heck they are doing’.”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch07note113" id="ch07note113"><sup>113</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_230"/>When the higher interest rates that were built into the loans set in, homeowners were not able to refinance their loans, as many had been led to believe that they could. This was because at just that moment banks tightened their lending standards. Falling house prices also removed the option of selling their homes to pay off their mortgages. And when the rising interest rates of subprime loans hit, again, people of color, who were also bearing the brunt of high unemployment and declining incomes, were disproportionately affected by the foreclosures that followed. Black households lost between $71 and $93 billion of wealth through subprime mortgage payments and defaults between 1998 and 2006.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch07note114" id="ch07note114"><sup>114</sup></a> It was no wonder that those suffering from every end of economic disenfranchisement were the first to lose their homes.</p>
<p class="indent">Lastly, countless others could not afford to buy homes at all, subprime mortgages or not. An overheated housing market and speculation drove prices up beyond the reach of many. Think of the impact that New York City’s “billionaire’s row” has on the fantastically overblown real estate market there. While 59<sup>th</sup> street in Manhattan houses some of the world’s richest people overlooking Central Park, two blocks down at 57th street, sleek glass skyscrapers are largely vacant for most of the year. They are investment properties for foreign capital. “If you put money in the bank in Germany, you’re getting negative interest. You can buy an apartment in Manhattan and get exponentially higher returns. It has caused all this money to flow into New York,” Stephen Shapiro of JLL’s New York capital markets group told the <em>Financial Times</em>.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch07note115" id="ch07note115"><sup>115</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_231"/><a id="page_232"/>In New York City, journalist Derek Thompson reported that “rampant luxury-home building” and the simultaneous “cratering of middle-class-home construction” has driven up the average price of a newly listed condo from $1.15 million to $3.77 million in the past decade.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch07note116" id="ch07note116"><sup>116</sup></a> By putting homeownership out of reach, most working-class residents are forced to rent, rather than own. This then has the effect of also overheating the <em>rental</em> market, driving up rents in the process.</p>
