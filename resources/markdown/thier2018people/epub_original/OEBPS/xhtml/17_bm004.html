<p class="noindent1"><strong>Absolute surplus value</strong> (<a href="10_ch004.html">Chapter 4</a>): Surplus value created through an extension of the workday.</p>
<p class="noindent1"><strong>Accumulation</strong> (<a href="11_ch005.html">Chapter 5</a>): The part of surplus value that is reinvested as capital (as opposed to consumed by capitalists themselves).</p>
<p class="noindent1"><strong>Bonds</strong> (<a href="13_ch007.html">Chapter 7</a>): Publicly traded debt. A company or state can borrow from public markets by issuing certificates, which will be repaid at a set time, with interest.</p>
<p class="noindent1"><strong>Bourgeoisie</strong> (<a href="07_ch001.html">Chapter 1</a>): The bourgeoisie, or capitalists, are the class of people who privately own the social means of production. Industrial capitalists employed workers to manufacture goods. Other capitalists employ workers to provide services, and finance capitalists, in the form of bankers and other investors, also play a central role in the capitalist economy.</p>
<p class="noindent1"><strong>C-M-C</strong> (<a href="10_ch004.html">Chapter 4</a>): The circuit of simple commodity exchange, in which goods exchange for their equivalents, using money as an intermediary.</p>
<p class="noindent1"><strong>Capital</strong> (<a href="10_ch004.html">Chapter 4</a>): Money that is used to accumulate more money. Capital’s power of self-expansion derives from a <em>social relation</em> in which workers are compelled to labor and produce value for the capitalists.</p>
<p class="noindent1"><strong>Capital markets</strong> (<a href="11_ch005.html">Chapter 5</a> &amp; <a href="13_ch007.html">7</a>): Financial markets in which long-term debt (bonds), shares of the company (stocks), or other financial assets are issued and traded.</p>

<p class="noindent1"><strong><a id="page_246"/>Collateralized debt obligations</strong> (<a href="13_ch007.html">Chapter 7</a>): CDOs are debt-based securities that package up bits and pieces of loans that are then divided into “tranches,” representing different levels of risk and organized into different rates of return, and then sold off to investors.</p>
<p class="noindent1"><strong>Commodity</strong> (<a href="08_ch002.html">Chapter 2</a>): A good, which has had human labor performed upon it, satisfies a demand within society, and is produced for the purpose of sale.</p>
<p class="noindent1"><strong>Commodity fetishism</strong> (<a href="08_ch002.html">Chapter 2</a>): Real social relations of production and exchange in capitalist society are hidden behind a veil of what appears to be a relationship between money and commodities.</p>
<p class="noindent1"><strong>Concentration</strong> (<a href="11_ch005.html">Chapter 5</a>): The process of a company growing through time, by way of accumulation.</p>
<p class="noindent1"><strong>Constant capital</strong> (<a href="10_ch004.html">Chapter 4</a>): Capital invested in the means of production. Its value reappears in the commodities produced. This value is transmitted as is through the production process.</p>
<p class="noindent1"><strong>Credit default swaps</strong> (<a href="13_ch007.html">Chapter 7</a>): CDSs function as a form of insurance on securities. They are purchased from a third entity that promises to pay the investor its expected returns in the event that the security fails.</p>
<p class="noindent1"><strong>Dead labor</strong> (<a href="08_ch002.html">Chapter 2</a>): Previous generations of labor, which carry past value into the process of production.</p>
<p class="noindent1"><strong>Derivatives</strong> (<a href="13_ch007.html">Chapter 7</a>): Types of securities or financial contracts (e.g. futures, forwards, swaps, and options) that derive their value from another asset or set of assets (e.g. stocks, bonds, currencies, or commodities).</p>
<p class="noindent1"><strong>Economies of scale</strong> (<a href="11_ch005.html">Chapter 5</a>): Cost advantages gained by businesses through operational efficiencies and economic leverages associated with an increased scale of production.</p>
<p class="noindent1"><strong>Equivalent value</strong> (<a href="09_ch003.html">Chapter 3</a>): An equivalent value provides a measurement for some other good’s value.</p>
<p class="noindent1"><strong>Exchange-value</strong> (<a href="08_ch002.html">Chapter 2</a>): The quantitative aspect of value: the ratio with which one commodity exchanges for other commodities.</p>

<p class="noindent1"><a id="page_247"/><strong>Financialization</strong> (<a href="13_ch007.html">Chapter 7</a>): A process in which financial markets and institutions have grown in size, complexity, and influence.</p>
<p class="noindent1"><strong>Gold standard</strong> (<a href="09_ch003.html">Chapter 3</a>): A system in which major currencies around the world were fixed against, and could ultimately be redeemed for, their worth in gold. It resulted in fixed exchange rates between currencies, since they were all measured against gold.</p>
<p class="noindent1"><strong>Great Recession</strong> (Introduction &amp; <a href="13_ch007.html">Chapter 7</a>): The economic crisis of 2007 into 2009 was the longest and deepest crisis in the United States since the Great Depression. It began with a collapse of a giant housing bubble followed by a stock market crash, the failure of the largest US investment banks, plummeting commodity prices, freezing of credit, and slowing international trade.</p>
<p class="noindent1"><strong>Human labor in the abstract</strong> (<a href="08_ch002.html">Chapter 2</a>): Quantities of generalized labor; i.e. not <em>what kind</em> of labor went into making something, rather <em>how much</em> of it was required.</p>
<p class="noindent1"><strong>Inflation</strong> (<a href="09_ch003.html">Chapter 3</a>): Inflation describes a situation in which prices of commodities rise. It can have many causes, but always reflects a fall in the value of money (against which commodities’ prices are measured). Each monetary unit can thus buy fewer goods than it used to.</p>
<p class="noindent1"><strong>Labor-power</strong> (<a href="10_ch004.html">Chapter 4</a>): The ability to work, sold to the capitalist for an agreed upon amount of time.</p>
<p class="noindent1"><strong>Labor theory of value</strong> (<a href="08_ch002.html">Chapter 2</a>): A commodity’s value is measured by the amount of generalized (or “abstract”) labor socially necessary to its production.</p>
<p class="noindent1"><strong>Living labor</strong> (<a href="08_ch002.html">Chapter 2</a>): Human labor engaged in the production of a commodity.</p>
<p class="noindent1"><strong>M-C-M’</strong> (<a href="10_ch004.html">Chapter 4</a>): The circuit of capital: money is invested in the production of commodities, which are sold on the market and result in a greater sum of money. Rather than money serving an <em>intermediary</em> role, the expansion of money is the <em>driver</em> of the process.</p>
<p class="noindent1"><strong>Manufacture</strong> (<a href="07_ch001.html">Chapter 1</a>): A system of production where groups of workers are assembled under one roof with machinery and raw materials, supervised, and paid a wage to construct commodities.</p>

<p class="noindent1"><strong>Middle class</strong> (<a href="07_ch001.html">Chapter 1</a> &amp; <a href="10_ch004.html">4</a>): A layer of society that stands between the working class and the capitalist class. It includes small business owners, as well as middle managers, supervisors, and professional occupations that have a fair amount of autonomy at their jobs.</p>
<p class="noindent1"><strong>Monopoly</strong> (<a href="11_ch005.html">Chapter 5</a>): A lone company that dominates its market. Pure monopolies are rare, but monopolistic tendencies and practices, whereby large companies take advantage of their preeminent positions, are common.</p>
<p class="noindent1"><strong>Moral depreciation</strong> (<a href="10_ch004.html">Chapter 4</a>): A machine loses value when newer machines are produced more cheaply. Its value is measured by the socially necessary labor-time that would now be needed to produce it, not the original labor-time objectified within it.</p>
<p class="noindent1"><strong>Necessary labor</strong> (<a href="10_ch004.html">Chapter 4</a>): The part of the workday required to reproduce the cost of labor-power.</p>
<p class="noindent1"><strong>Neoliberalism</strong> (<a href="13_ch007.html">Chapter 7</a>): The ideology and policies associated with free market liberalization: privatization, speedups, increased productivity, and deregulation.</p>

<p class="noindent1"><strong>Organic composition of capital</strong> (<a href="12_ch006.html">Chapter 6</a>): The ratio of the value invested in constant capital to the value invested in variable capital: c/v.</p>
<p class="noindent1"><strong>Overaccumulation</strong> (<a href="12_ch006.html">Chapter 6</a>): When capitalists cannot find a profitable outlet to invest their surplus. This leads to unused capacity in the form of idle factories, machinery, etc.</p>
<p class="noindent1"><strong>Overproduction</strong> (<a href="12_ch006.html">Chapter 6</a>): When supply outpaces demand. If this occurs in key industries and is generalized across the economy, it results in a “crisis of overproduction.”</p>
<p class="noindent1"><strong>Price</strong> (<a href="09_ch003.html">Chapter 3</a>): The ratio between a given quantity of a commodity and its equivalent in money.</p>

<p class="noindent1"><strong>Rate of exploitation</strong> (<a href="10_ch004.html">Chapter 4</a>): See “rate of surplus value.”</p>
<p class="noindent1"><a id="page_249"/><strong>Rate of profit</strong> (<a href="10_ch004.html">Chapter 4</a>): The ratio of surplus value to the total amount of capital invested: s/(c+v).</p>
<p class="noindent1"><strong>Rate of surplus value</strong> (<a href="10_ch004.html">Chapter 4</a>): The ratio of surplus value to variable capital (s/v). That is the amount of extra value pocketed by capitalists relative to capital investment in labor-power. It expresses the degree of exploitation of labor-power by capital (and is therefore synonymous with a “rate of exploitation”).</p>
<p class="noindent1"><strong>Relative surplus value</strong> (<a href="10_ch004.html">Chapter 4</a>): Surplus value created by shortening the amount of time necessary to produce the equivalent of the workers’ wages.</p>
<p class="noindent1"><strong>Relative value</strong> (<a href="09_ch003.html">Chapter 3</a>): A value that is being determined relative to another value.</p>
<p class="noindent1"><strong>Reserve army of laborers (or surplus population)</strong> (<a href="10_ch004.html">Chapter 4</a>): Unemployed people. Unemployment is a necessity for capital, which uses it as a tool to discipline the paid workforce through the threat of being easily replaced.</p>
<p class="noindent1"><strong>Securities</strong> (<a href="13_ch007.html">Chapter 7</a>): Tradable financial assets.</p>
<p class="noindent1"><strong>Shadow banks</strong> (<a href="13_ch007.html">Chapter 7</a>): Financial intermediaries that perform banklike activity, but are not regulated as banks.</p>

<p class="noindent1"><strong>Structured investment vehicles</strong> (<a href="13_ch007.html">Chapter 7</a>): SIVs are non-bank financial institutions often created by banks offshore in order to avoid taxes and regulation. They give sponsoring banks the ability to invest in securities, without having to keep the riskier loans on their balance sheets. Money for investments are raised through borrowing funds from investors, but their sponsoring banks are on the line to back up any liquidity gaps if the SIVs are not able to raise enough through loans.</p>
<p class="noindent1"><strong>Subprime mortgages</strong> (<a href="13_ch007.html">Chapter 7</a>): Mortgage loans that require little money down and skirt credit requirements for borrowers looking to purchase a home. <a id="page_250"/>These loans incur steeply rising high interest rates when the loans “reset” down the road.</p>
<p class="noindent1"><strong>Surplus labor</strong> (<a href="10_ch004.html">Chapter 4</a>): The part of the workday that produces additional value once the value of workers’ labor-power has been reproduced.</p>
<p class="noindent1"><strong>Surplus value</strong> (<a href="10_ch004.html">Chapter 4</a>): Accumulated product of the unpaid labor-time of workers (see “surplus labor”).</p>
<p class="noindent1"><strong>Tendency for the rate of profit to fall</strong> (<a href="12_ch006.html">Chapter 6</a>): A historic tendency for the rate of profit to fall as a result of the growing productivity of labor (reflected in a rising organic composition of capital). As capitalists employ less labor and invest more in machinery, the part of the investment that generates <em>new, added</em> value drops. That is, the surplus value per unit of capital falls.</p>
<p class="noindent1"><strong>Turnover rate of capital</strong> (<a href="12_ch006.html">Chapter 6</a>): The time that elapses between the investment of capital towards the production process, and when the produced goods are sold. The faster the speed in which invested capital becomes sold, the more rounds of production can happen within a given span of time.</p>
<p class="noindent1"><strong>Universal equivalent</strong> (<a href="09_ch003.html">Chapter 3</a>): A universal equivalent is a commodity against which all other commodities are measured.</p>
<p class="noindent1"><strong>Use-value</strong> (<a href="08_ch002.html">Chapter 2</a>): The qualitative aspect of value: how it is used. The item itself could also be called a “use-value” to refer to it as an item of want. E.g. the use-value of bread is that it provides nourishment. But you could also call bread a “use-value” because people want or need bread.</p>
<p class="noindent1"><strong>Variable capital</strong> (<a href="10_ch004.html">Chapter 4</a>): Capital invested in labor-power, which reproduces the equivalent of labor-power itself, and also produces an excess surplus value.</p>
<p class="noindent1"><strong>Working class</strong> (<a href="07_ch001.html">Chapter 1</a> &amp; <a href="10_ch004.html">4</a>): A class of people made up of anyone that must sell their labor in order to work and has no access to the means of production themselves.</p>
