<p class="chap_title"><strong>THE CORONAVIRUS CRISIS</strong></p>
<p class="noindent">We managed to stop this book on its way to the printer so that I could add some remarks about the unfolding economic collapse. At the moment that this book was going to print, we were in the early stages of a devastating public health catastrophe, which in its first few months had already claimed a hundred thousand lives, and the economic consequences of which seemed to be pushing us off a financial cliff.</p>
<p class="indent">Rereading the conclusion to this book, I wondered how long it would be before the <em>Financial Times</em> would follow up on their morbid assessment of the Japanese funeral industry, which is still unable to revive despite truly “peak death.” The extent to which capitalism utilizes profit metrics, but understands nothing of life metrics, has become unambiguously transparent to billions of people around the world. Barely a month after most states in the US issued stay-at-home orders politicians of all stripes started clamoring for dates to return to work. The system can’t comprehend a scenario in which we prioritize public health for so long that it might interfere too greatly with economic output. Ultimately, every political decision is measured as a cost-benefit analysis.<a href="19_bm006.html#aftnote1" id="aftnote1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">How many will have gone through the experience of losing friends and family members to a pandemic that could have been avoided, or at minimum mitigated until a vaccine was developed? How many will have bitterly digested the fact that authorities stepped in to save the stock market before looking out for the well-being of their loved ones? 2020 will go down as the year that the system showed itself to be utterly disinterested in saving hundreds of thousands, possibly millions, of lives. Capitalism in general, its US brand in particular, failed spectacularly at handling a predicted viral threat.</p>
<p class="indent">It’s impossible at this moment to make predictions about the economic consequences of the pandemic beyond stating the obvious: they are already <a id="page_238"/>extreme and unprecedented. The exact trajectory of the crisis will be greatly impacted by the still-unknown biological timeline of the novel coronavirus. And while I write this afterword, we appear to be entering the beginning stages of a recessionary spiral. But a few points seem worth sketching out.</p>
<p class="indent">First, the coronavirus pandemic is a capitalist pandemic: From the role of factory farming in exposing humans to zoonotic diseases (originating in animals), to health care systems stripped bare by decades of budget cuts, to states and hospitals buckling under the pressures of bidding wars for masks and ventilators, to a for-profit pharmaceutical industry that has until now refused to undertake developing a general cure for the flu and its deadly variants, because while it may be <em>possible</em> it is not <em>profitable</em>. The state, too, has confirmed its decidedly partisan role as the “a committee for managing the common affairs of the whole bourgeoisie.”<a href="19_bm006.html#aftnote2" id="aftnote2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">The United States government took the most criminal of approaches. Despite repeated briefings in which analysts concluded, as early as November of 2019, that a viral infection could cause a “cataclysmic event,” Trump and his administration dragged their feet for months. “It’s one person coming in from China, and we have it under control. It’s going to be just fine,” Trump said in January.<a href="19_bm006.html#aftnote3" id="aftnote3"><sup>3</sup></a> With no nationwide response to the virus in place, COVID-19 spread to literally every county in the country. The administration finally stepped in to save Wall Street, and only secondarily committed a fraction of the bailout resources to Main Street.</p>
<p class="indent">The government may well get pushed into taking a few positive steps, simply for the sake of forestalling a complete social and economic meltdown, but so far their actions have been wildly inadequate. Less than 10 percent of stimulus spending is going to the health care sector. And the much-touted direct payments to individuals of $1200 will barely cover a week’s worth of expenses for most.</p>
<p class="indent">Second, the working class will once again be made to pay—with our lives, our livelihoods, and our well-being. While the rich and famous were reporting their Coronavirus test results on social media at the outset, millions of people could not access testing, including health care workers on the frontlines of fighting the pandemic. State and local officials waited far too long to issue stay-at-home orders and close down schools and other institutions, leaving workers (particularly low-wage and frontline workers) vulnerable, and allowing the virus rip through many communities.</p>
<p class="indent">People of color, who already bear the brunt of economic inequalities and discrimination, are therefore inordinately vulnerable to the spread and <a id="page_239"/>deathly impact of the virus. Conditions of poverty, which disproportionately impact people of color, exacerbated the COVID-19 disaster: cramped living conditions that make social distancing impossible, pre-existing chronic diseases like high blood pressure, heart disease and diabetes, and jobs that don’t allow for telecommuting and/or are deemed essential (as grocery workers, delivery people, nurse aides and nurses, and sanitation). In New York City, the <em>New York Times</em> reported death rates for Black and Latinx people were twice as high as those of white people. In Chicago, Black people account for 72 percent of deaths, despite the fact that they make up less than a third of the city’s population.<a href="19_bm006.html#aftnote4" id="aftnote4"><sup>4</sup></a> The neighborhoods that are majority Black or Latinx are those that suffer most from lack of testing sites and available hospital beds, while those that make it to a hospital are then less likely than their white counterparts to be treated properly once they arrive.<a href="19_bm006.html#aftnote5" id="aftnote5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">Though middle-income tourists and travelers may have set in motion the initial global spread of the virus, the virus is rooting itself in the world’s poorest neighborhoods and slums, where it wreaks havoc. In densely populated cities with weak health care infrastructure, few resources, and no economic wiggle-room, entire communities may be destroyed. For years down the line, economies that already carried extreme debt burdens will be unable to access new lines of credit. They will suffer the simultaneous impacts of the disease and the dried-up funding to deal with its consequences.</p>
<p class="indent">Finally, while I promised to stay away from making predictions, there is one forecast I will make: the talking heads of the mainstream media and the Federal Reserve will get <em>their</em> predictions wrong. At the first sign of financial turmoil, the Fed swooped in with trillions of dollars into unchartered territory, buying up every kind of security—from US treasuries, to mortgage-backed securities, to junk bonds. The purpose was to inject cash into the financial system and prop up every major credit market. In response to the Fed’s early actions, and despite the steepest ever drop in employment numbers, the stock markets rebounded and investors were giddy: “It is both shocking and almost amazing,” said one investment banker to the <em>Financial Times</em>.<a href="19_bm006.html#aftnote6" id="aftnote6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">But there was more to the stock market’s wild swings than just elation at the Fed’s giveaways. The early bounces were an indication of confidence among investors who thought that the economy could be turned off with stay-at-home shutdowns, and then simply turned back on again once the pandemic passes. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell gave a reassuring spin on April 9: “When the spread of the virus is under control, businesses will reopen, and people will come back to work. There is every reason to believe <a id="page_240"/>that the economic rebound, when it comes, can be robust…. We would expect there to be a fairly quick rebound.”<a href="19_bm006.html#aftnote7" id="aftnote7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">It’s hard to know whether this is a lie or a delusion or some combination of the two. Even in an unlikely best-case scenario, in which we only have to contend with one wave of coronavirus infections, and can wake up one morning to safely return to work, the economy will not suddenly rebound. The dramatic scale of the layoffs in the first weeks of the crisis cannot be overcome easily and many businesses will have gone bankrupt in the process. Even those large corporations that survive the crisis, will come back online with much reduced capacity.</p>
<p class="indent">Supply chains have also been severely broken, unevenly and in many places. Some companies will find themselves lacking raw materials and inputs when they attempt to restart production. Demand too, has utterly cratered. The ripple effects will engulf much of the world economy. For instance, as auto factories idle across the US and Europe, demand for steel, electronics, and other components will collapse. And millions of unemployed people won’t start spending until they find full and stable employment again.</p>
<p class="indent">In short, the scale of disruption to economy is hard to exaggerate, and even harder to imagine a seamless recovery from. Instead, we will likely see mountains of bad debt and defaults from both bankrupt corporations and among the millions of unemployed. As this happens, banks will call in their debts, causing credit to dry up. Just as in 2008, actions by the Federal Reserve to lower interest and pump money into the economy will not necessarily translate to banks making loans when they see no profitable rates of return.</p>
<p class="indent">In fact, the global economy was already on shaky foundations before the pandemic hit. The World Trade Organization is currently forecasting shrinkage of 13 to 32 percentages in global trade volume. But global trade growth in 2019 had already slowed to its lowest level since the Great Recession. Throughout the Great Recession’s recovery, GDP growth rates as well bordered on stagnation in most advanced economies.<a href="19_bm006.html#aftnote8" id="aftnote8"><sup>8</sup></a> Business earnings slumped, corporate debt hit record highs, while corporate investments were historically low. Wage growth has been practically nonexistent, and millions of working families are saddled with more debt than ever. The country’s pre-coronavirus low unemployment rate was based on the addition of poorly paid, low-skilled, temporary, and part-time work.</p>
<p class="indent">The contradictions that had set off the crisis of 2007 to 2008—economic polarization, corporate and consumer debt, and financial deregulation—were never resolved. Rather than a classic capitalist crisis in which bankruptcies <a id="page_241"/>and a destruction of capital give way to a recovery, and the most efficient capitals advance at the expense of the least efficient, the federal government bailed the system out. Central banks provided a multi-trillion-dollar lifeline to the financial system and to thousands of unprofitable companies.</p>
<p class="indent">Among the consequences of these policies was the growth of corporate debt to a record $13.5 trillion worldwide.<a href="19_bm006.html#aftnote9" id="aftnote9"><sup>9</sup></a> The stock market surged, in the form of corporate stock buybacks, but business investment and advances in productivity lagged. The “age of austerity” of the past decade meant that we saw too little fiscal stimulus (government spending), but instead witnessed a constant injection of monetary stimulus (tinkering with interest rates and money supplies). The heavily indebted corporations, the frayed global trade system, and millions of struggling families will not easily weather the severe shocks to supply, demand, production, and employment.</p>
<p class="indent">The federal government will continue to try more of the same policies, albeit with greater force and speed. The problem is that to the extent to which they have financial strategies (limited and contradictory though they might be), they have no health care strategies. The system is simply not set up to prioritize our health. Rather than fortifying a threadbare health care system or a nonexistent social safety net, the government is committed to bailing out climate-change inducing industries and financial markets. Capitalism is a system that revolves around exchange-values, and cares little for use-values.</p>
<p class="indent">Like other crises, the current crisis also exposes important cracks in the system. Because of its scale, and because of its life-or-death consequences, these cracks are likely to be more indicting than at any other time since the Great Depression. The next few years will likely be brutal, and will most certainly require struggles on every front for defensive demands: funding of basic medical supplies, tests, and hospital beds; and for offensive demands, too: Medicare for All, the expansion of social security and unemployment benefits, the demand to nationalize banks and make issuance of credit a social function, and investment in a Green New Deal, for the rebuilding of the economy on ecologically sustainable lines.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_242"/>More than ever, we need determined organizing efforts alongside of a vision for a different kind of society—one that is organized around principles of planetary survival, human health, and justice. There is nothing easy or automatic about waging these struggles, but we know that the alternative is a system that fails us every time.</p>
