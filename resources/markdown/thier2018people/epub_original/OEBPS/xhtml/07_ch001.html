<p class="chap_title"><strong>THE BIRTH OF CAPITAL</strong></p>
<p class="block">If money, according to Augier, “comes into the world with a congenital bloodstain on one cheek,” capital comes dripping from head to foot, from every pore, with blood and dirt.</p>
<p class="blockr"><em>—Capital, Volume 1</em><a href="19_bm006.html#ch01note1" id="ch01note1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p class="h3">THREE MINUTES OF HUMAN HISTORY</p>
<p class="noindent">Capitalism, we’re told, is a natural—even eternal—expression of the human condition. It seems, the argument goes, that human beings are hardwired to be greedy, hierarchical, and inevitably organized into dog-eat-dog societies. A policy paper from the Cato Institute, for instance, explained: “Property rights are prefigured in nature by the way animals mark out territories for their exclusive use in foraging, hunting, and mating.” They concluded, “the human mind is ‘built’ to trade.”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch01note2" id="ch01note2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">But capitalism is not eternal, and it is not intrinsic to “human nature,” if such a thing exists. An exploitative system of commodity production and exchange arose over time, neither inevitably nor smoothly, appearing on the scene only recently in human history. The first traces of modern humans date back to more than two hundred thousand years ago. But it was only in the last five thousand years (i.e. during less than three percent of human history) that the first class societies arose.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch01note3" id="ch01note3"><sup>3</sup></a> Modern industrial capitalism surfaced just a few hundred years ago (i.e. in the last 0.25 percent of human history). In other words, if human history took place over the course of a single day, capitalism only unfolded three minutes before midnight.</p>
<p class="indent">Throughout most of our history, humankind lived in hunter-gatherer societies, which organized themselves to meet basic needs—food, water, shelter. Agriculture had not yet been developed, and societies generated little to no excess beyond what was needed for day-to-day subsistence. There was no significant surplus to be hoarded by individuals or communities. Our ancestors tended, in fact, toward common ownership and egalitarianism, and organized themselves by and large into loose-knit collectives with decision-making dispersed among its members.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch01note4" id="ch01note4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_12"/>As anthropologist Eleanor Burke Leacock argued, hunter-gatherer societies required “great individual initiative and decisiveness” among their members. “Decision-making in this context calls for concepts other than ours of leader and led, dominant and deferent, no matter how loosely these are seen to apply.”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch01note5" id="ch01note5"><sup>5</sup></a> Just as greed and deference to authority are attributes encouraged in our current society, autonomy was a much more useful trait for hunter-gatherers. One example quoted by Leacock was the observation of Jesuit missionary Paul Le Jeune, who came into contact with the Montagnais-Naskapi people in the seventeenth century in Canada. He complained:</p>
<p class="block">They imagine that they ought by right of birth, to enjoy the liberty of wild ass colts, rendering no homage to anyone whomsoever, except when they like. They have reproached me a hundred times because we fear our Captains, while they laugh at and make sport of theirs. All the authority of their chief is in his tongue’s end; for he is powerful insofar as he is eloquent; and, even, if he kills himself talking and haranguing, he will not be obeyed unless he pleases the Savages.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch01note6" id="ch01note6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">Why and how did it come to pass that hierarchical class societies arose out of communities that had been broadly egalitarian and enjoyed the freedom of “wild ass colts” for many millennia? And out of these hierarchical societies, what were the historical conditions that paved the way for capitalism, in particular, to emerge and to eventually dominate the world we live in? These questions deserve their own sets of books, and I will only skim the surface here. But from these broad outlines, we can begin to sketch out a framework that can help us understand the anatomy of capitalism.</p>
<p class="h3">FROM SURPLUS TO CLASS</p>
<p class="noindent">The story begins with the development of agriculture about twelve thousand years ago. The advent of agriculture opened up the possibility of producing a <em>surplus</em> of food items, which could be stored for future need. Rather than the precariousness of hand-to-mouth living, the safety of that surplus on hand meant that communities could settle and grow, and some members of the group could specialize in the production of non-food items. Between the third and fourth millennia BCE, towns spread across the globe from Mesopotamia to India to China to Africa.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_13"/>Throughout several thousand millennia, the need for supervision and control over these surpluses meant that societies became increasingly socially stratified. Initially, this was likely in the interest of the group as a whole, as it provided stability through the ups and downs of weather patterns and access to resources. But ultimately those who maintained and supervised the surplus—and who would eventually appropriate this surplus through violence, taxes, or both—cohered into a social class, distinct from the majority.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch01note7" id="ch01note7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">It took millennia for conflicting “classes”—groups of people with different relationships to the production, ownership, and distribution of wealth and goods—to form. We’ll delve into classes more fully in chapter four. In the meantime, for our purposes here, note that various kinds of societies built upon these divisions—slavery, tributary and feudal modes of production, and later capitalism—developed worldwide. This process was not smooth or automatic, nor one that came about without resistance.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch01note8" id="ch01note8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p class="h3">CAPITALISM’S “ROSY DAWN”</p>
<p class="noindent">Capitalism is one type of class society—the type that dominates the globe today. It first emerged in medieval Europe, where feudal societies had been dominant. Exactly how and why the transition from feudalism to capitalism came about is a highly contested and complex history,<a href="19_bm006.html#ch01note9" id="ch01note9"><sup>9</sup></a> and beyond the purview of this book, but it’s useful to examine what distinguished capitalism from feudalism in order to look at what makes capitalism unique.</p>
<p class="indent">Feudalism essentially divided monarchic lands among local lords. These lords then ruled over the inhabitants of their respective estates. Tied to the lord’s estates, serfs (unfree peasants) were put to work. They had to pay their lords with money, or with a portion of their harvest, or by tilling the lord’s fields for a certain number of days per week.</p>
<p class="indent">In feudal society, peasants generally had access to enough land and tools to sustain themselves and their families. The lord’s manor included common lands, where “commoners” had rights to work the land and pasture cattle. As paltry as their subsistence was, it provided some economic independence. Because serfs felt no <em>economic</em> compulsion to work (the need for a wage in order to survive), it was ultimately the lord’s capacity to mobilize force that prevented peasants from keeping the total fruits of their labor, or from fleeing bondage altogether. Because the enrichment of the lord was dependent on violence, this incentivized each lord to make ever-greater investment in weapons and warfare, rather than develop new, innovative productive techniques (much less tend to the social welfare of his serfs).<a href="19_bm006.html#ch01note10" id="ch01note10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_14"/>When capitalism emerged, it developed a wholly new social order, one that required severing the masses of people from access to land, tools, and resources. Rather than a peasantry violently coerced to turn over goods to their lords, capitalism created a new underclass of wageworkers—a class of people theoretically free to work where and how they pleased, but who would in practice be compelled—by economic necessity—to produce a surplus for someone else nonetheless. Over the course of three centuries (from the fourteenth century until the Industrial Revolution of 1780–1850) the transformation of feudal relationships to capitalist ones created a system of production based on the exploitation of “free” wage labor: a social order of haves and have-nots.</p>
<p class="indent">Neither the process, nor the exploitative arrangement that it gave rise to, was “natural” or automatic. As Marx wrote:</p>
<p class="block">One thing, however, is clear: nature does not produce on the one hand owners of money or commodities, and on the other hand men possessing nothing but their own labor-power. This relation has no basis in natural history, nor does it have a social basis common to all periods of human history. It is clearly the result of a past historical development, the product of many economic revolutions, of the extinction of a whole series of older formations of social production.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch01note11" id="ch01note11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p class="noindent">What were these “past historical development[s]” that created two types of people—one owning wealth and the means to generate more wealth, and the other owning little more than the skins on their backs? Classical economists like Adam Smith argued that capital came to be through a gradually evolving division of labor, where some people became traders, and some of these traders would eventually—through thriftiness or hard work—save enough wealth to build factories and employ workers. Marx mocked the conventional wisdom of mainstream economists of his time:</p>
<p class="block">This primitive accumulation plays approximately the same role in political economy as original sin does in theology. Adam bit the apple, and there-upon sin fell on the human race. Its origin is supposed to be explained when it is told as an anecdote about the past. Long, long ago there were two sorts of people; one, the diligent, intelligent and above all frugal elite; the other, lazy rascals, spending their substance, and more, in riotous living…. Thus it came to pass that the former sort accumulated wealth, and the latter sort finally had nothing to sell except their own skins. And from this original sin dates the poverty of the great majority who, despite all their labor, have up to now nothing to sell but themselves, and the wealth of the few that increases constantly, although they have long ceased to work. Such insipid childishness is every day preached to us in the defense of property.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch01note12" id="ch01note12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_15"/>The division of society into haves and have-nots did not gently come to pass, and certainly not through the frugalness and intelligence of a small elite. It was the outcome of a violent upheaval, which forced large swaths of the population from their lands and traditional means of self-sufficiency. As we’ll see, laws and coercive means had to be employed to discipline a new class of laborers. Further, political revolutions discussed below placed a new capitalist elite at the helm of states, which could systematically repress the struggles of the dispossessed, advance markets and plunder abroad, and tend to other needs of the burgeoning elite. The violence, coercion, legislation, and upheavals necessary for the birth of this new system evince just how <em>un</em>natural and vicious the road to capitalism was.</p>
<p class="h3">WHERE WEALTH ACCUMULATES, AND MEN DECAY</p>
<p class="noindent">In England, where capitalism gained its first foothold, it did so on the basis of what’s referred to as the “Enclosure Movement.”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch01note13" id="ch01note13"><sup>13</sup></a> Millions of acres of common land were violently confiscated and turned into privately-owned plots during several centuries. Traditional rights to use common land for farming or grazing livestock were revoked, land was fenced in (enclosed) and restricted to private owners—whether through payment, theft, or law. Through this process, land was concentrated into the hands of few landowners, while masses of people were left with no means of self-sustenance, and therefore no means to maintain economic independence.</p>
<p class="indent">Forced evictions of peasants left villagers landless and roaming the country seeking livelihood and subsistence. English farmer, journalist, and pamphleteer William Cobbett reported on conditions created by enclosures and disasters that befell everyday people who were left “ragged as colts and pale as ashes.”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch01note14" id="ch01note14"><sup>14</sup></a> “The day was cold too,” he related one day in November, “and frost hardly off the ground; and their blue arms and lips would have made any heart ache but that of a set-seller or a loan-jobber.” The next day, he came upon another village, where:</p>
<p class="block"><a id="page_16"/>The laborers seem miserably poor. Their dwellings are little better than pig-beds, and their looks indicate that their food is not nearly equal to that of a pig. Their wretched hovels are stuck upon little bits of ground on the roadside…. Yesterday morning was a sharp frost; and this had set the poor creatures to digging up their little plats of potatoes. In my whole life, I never saw human wretchedness equal to this.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch01note15" id="ch01note15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">Landowners benefited greatly from combining many small plots, which previously had been tilled by individual peasants, into large estates that could be more productive. Peasants, meanwhile, were obliged to pay rent and yearly leases, or be forced off the land. Many, unable to pay rent, became agricultural workers on large farms. Yet agricultural work did not keep pace with the growth of the uprooted population. Many more peasants were “set free” to become the “proletarians”—or workers—in burgeoning manufacturing towns.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch01note16" id="ch01note16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">From the sixteenth to the eighteenth centuries a new system of <small>MANUFACTURE</small> developed in the towns. Here groups of workers were assembled under one roof with machinery and raw materials, supervised (to avoid the common theft of raw materials at home) and paid a wage to produce commodities. Those that bankrolled the operations—and reaped its rewards—were the nascent capitalists. The <small>BOURGEOISIE</small>—or capitalists—are the class of people who own the means to produce (land, factories, tools, and materials), and employ laborers to do the work of production. The early capitalists were made up of merchants, lords that had become agricultural capitalists, as well as yeoman farmers (richer peasants who owned their land).</p>
<p class="indent">In several northern French towns in the eighteenth century, for example, thousands of workers were amassed into factories to make wool fabrics. This process was global, though it happened unevenly across both geography and industry types. Where it took hold, it revolutionized production. According to anthropologist James Blaut, “cities dotted the landscape from northern Europe to southern Africa to eastern Asia.” He recounts the emergence of a vast global network of trade and manufacture:</p>
<p class="block">In all three continents we find relatively small rural regions (they were generally hinterlands of major port cities), along with a few highly commercialized agricultural and mining regions, which were clearly being penetrated by capitalism…. Among them were Flanders, south eastern England, northern Italy, sugar-planting regions of Morocco, the Nile Valley, the Gold Coast, Kilwa, Sofala (and hypothetically part of Zimbabwe), Malabar, Coromanchel, Bengal, northern Java and south coastal China.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch01note17" id="ch01note17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_17"/>For manufacture to advance, a rising capitalist class needed a counterpart class: laborers who could be employed whenever and wherever industrialists wanted them. These laborers had to be doubly free, in Marx’s words: free from serfdom in order to be employed at will, but also free of land and the means to produce their own sustenance. On this basis, they could be disciplined to accept the terms of working for a wage. Marx wrote: “For the transformation of money into capital, the owner of money must find the free worker available on the commodity-market; and this worker must be free in the double sense that as a free individual he can dispose of his labor-power as his own commodity, and that, on the other hand, he has no other commodity for sale, i.e. he is rid of them, he is free of all the objects needed for the realization of his labor-power.”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch01note18" id="ch01note18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">As long as peasants and their families had some economic independence, obligation to serve their feudal lords was quite transparent—landowners and the state had to physically wrest a portion of the peasants’ harvest through rent and taxes. Under the guise of freedom and democracy, the new landless wage laborers were “free” to sell their labor-power to whomever they chose … or face starvation. Marx described the new setup as wage slavery. “The Roman slave was held by chains; the wage-laborer is bound to his owner by invisible threads.”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch01note19" id="ch01note19"><sup>19</sup></a> He explained: “The starting point of the development that gave rise both to the wage-laborer and to the capitalist was the enslavement of the worker. The advance made consisted of a change in the <em>form</em> of this servitude, in the transformation of feudal exploitation into capitalist exploitation.”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch01note20" id="ch01note20"><sup>20</sup></a> [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="indent">Thus while Adam Smith was writing a capitalist manifesto in <em>The Wealth of Nations</em>, and other enlightenment philosophers, economists, and writers were celebrating the rise of capitalist ideals, the ugly underbelly of this new wealth was making itself known. In 1770, just six years before the publication of <em>The Wealth of Nations</em>, Irish poet and playwright Oliver Goldsmith wrote “The Deserted Village.” His poem condemned enclosures, rural depopulation and the explosive growth of wealth. It read in part:</p>
<p class="blockc"><em>No more thy glassy brook reflects the day, But choked with sedges, works its weedy way;… Ill fares the land, to hastening ills a prey, Where wealth accumulates, and men decay. … But times are altered: trade’s unfeeling train Usurp the land, and dispossess the swain; Along the lawn, where scattered hamlets rose, Unwieldy wealth and cumbrous pomp repose.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch01note21" id="ch01note21"><sup>21</sup></a></em></p>
<p class="h3"><a id="page_18"/>PRISONERS OF STARVATION: DISCIPLINING THE NEW WORKING CLASS</p>
<p class="noindent">The expropriated peasants-turned-workers were subjected to a new hell on earth in “dark satanic mills,” so-called by poet William Blake. There they were “subjected to inflexible regulations, and drivel like gear-wheels by the pitiless movement of a mechanism without a soul. Entering a mill was like entering barracks or a prison.”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch01note22" id="ch01note22"><sup>22</sup></a> Forcing new laborers into these satanic mills required legislation punishable by beatings, imprisonments, branding, and mutilation.</p>
<p class="indent">Freely deployed labor was a necessary component for a rising capitalist system. But creating a new laboring class was a bitter, destructive process. And even the threat of starvation was not enough to prevent “idleness” and “loitering.” Towns and countrysides became populated with vagabonds and beggars or day laborers looking for work and at the mercy of wealthy landowners and bosses. In 1739, the Marquis of Argenson, a French nobleman, noted in his memoirs: “For a year now misery has been progressing in the kingdom at an incredible rate; ‘men die like flies, poverty stricken and browsing grass.’”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch01note23" id="ch01note23"><sup>23</sup></a> Not surprisingly, enclosures were met by riots, the tearing down of fences, the destruction of estates, and full-scale rebellions—such as Kett’s Rebellion of 1549, which swelled to sixteen thousand strong and briefly captured the second largest city in England.</p>
<p class="indent">The new working class was forged through brutal legislation against vagabondage, joblessness, and begging. “Thus were the agricultural folk first forcibly expropriated from the soil,” writes Marx, “driven from their homes, turned into vagabonds, and then whipped, branded, tortured by grotesquely terroristic laws into accepting the discipline necessary for the system of wage-labor.”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch01note24" id="ch01note24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">In England, a law entitled “voluntary criminals” in 1530, for instance, called for:</p>
<p class="block">whipping and imprisonment for sturdy vagabonds. They are to be tied to cart-tail and whipped until the blood streams from their bodies, then they are to swear an oath to go back to their birthplace or to where they have lived the last three years and to ‘put themselves to labor.’ … For the second arrest for vagabondage, the whipping is to be repeated and half the ear sliced off; but for the third relapse the offender is to be executed as a hardened criminal and enemy of the common weal.”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch01note25" id="ch01note25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page_19"/>A statute in 1547 condemned idlers to become enslaved, whipped, chained, and branded with the letter V on their breast.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch01note26" id="ch01note26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">Marx eloquently summed up how workers were forced to accept their lot as “natural.” Over time, the economic relations of capitalism would enforce themselves daily upon the working class as “self-evident natural laws” and, for the most part, without great fanfare:</p>
<p class="block">The organization of the capitalist process of production, once it is fully developed, breaks down all resistance… The silent compulsion of economic relations sets the seal on the domination of the capitalist over the worker. Direct extra-economic force is still of course used, but only in exceptional cases. In the ordinary run of things, the worker can be left to the “natural laws of production,” i.e. it is possible to rely on his dependence on capital, which springs from the conditions of production themselves, and is guaranteed in perpetuity by them.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch01note27" id="ch01note27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
<p class="noindent">In other words, at capitalism’s dawn, the rising bourgeoisie depended heavily on the power of the state to enforce its collective will. Capitalism today still depends on the state and the <em>threat</em> of violence, but in its everyday running breaks down resistance through the “silent compulsion” of economic necessity.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch01note28" id="ch01note28"><sup>28</sup></a> Lacking our own land, tools, and technology to independently provide for ourselves and our families, we have no choice but to labor for others.</p>
<p class="h3">A STATE OF THEIR OWN</p>
<p class="noindent">Marx wrote that the “economic structure of capitalist society has grown out of the economic structure of feudal society. The dissolution of the latter set free the elements of the former.”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch01note29" id="ch01note29"><sup>29</sup></a> He meant that the development of capitalist relationships and production grew within feudal society before they broke out into fully capitalist societies. The contradictions between the two forms of societies did not automatically translate into clear conflicts between the old order and the burgeoning new elites. The monarchic states of kings and their lords in fact helped to facilitate the enclosures and laws to discipline the working class, as well as encourage trade and finance factories and new forms of production in the cities.</p>
<p class="indent">Yet feudal relationships also fettered the rising capitalist class. The monarchies and the landholding class were more interested in building up riches, weaponry, and their armies, and tended to slow and squander opportunities for economic advances. Society would increasingly divide between forces of economic “progress”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch01note30" id="ch01note30"><sup>30</sup></a> and forces that still benefited tremendously from the existing feudal relationships. These contradictions broke out into bourgeois revolutions in Western Europe—the Dutch Revolution of the sixteenth century, the English Revolutions of 1640 and 1688, and the Great French Revolution of 1789. Each in turn provided pivot points, which broke apart feudal tenures and helped to establish the states’ intervention on behalf of the capitalist class.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch01note31" id="ch01note31"><sup>31</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_20"/>Most critically, the bourgeoisie gained the economic upper hand through the Industrial Revolution in England and through its political counterpart in the French Revolution. <em>Economic</em> breakthroughs necessitated new <em>political</em> ideology, around which the new bourgeois class, and in some cases lower classes, could be rallied. They propagated worldviews—such as the right to private property, freedom from servitude, and an end to hereditary power. As British Marxist Chris Harman argued: “That class required its own ideas, its own organization and, eventually, its own revolutionary leadership. Where its most determined elements managed to create such things, the new society took root.”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch01note32" id="ch01note32"><sup>32</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">The bourgeois revolutions were essential to securing capitalist states. These states defended the new class and its interests, and facilitated the expansion of their economic power domestically and abroad.</p>
<p class="h3">A “PRIMITIVE ACCUMULATION” OF WEALTH</p>
<p class="noindent">Why capitalism first got its footing in Britain and a few other pockets in Western Europe is another source of controversy among Marxists and other radical historians.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch01note33" id="ch01note33"><sup>33</sup></a> Whichever the reasons, its eventual domination would not have decisively cohered without the brutal enslavement of as many as twenty million Africans over the four centuries of the Atlantic trade of enslaved people. The monstrous horrors of that trade have been well documented—the buying, breeding, and selling of human beings as though they were cattle; the tearing apart of families;<a href="19_bm006.html#ch01note34" id="ch01note34"><sup>34</sup></a> the cruelty of slave drivers in whipping, mutilating, raping, and killing enslaved people; put simply, “the ultimate degradation of man.”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch01note35" id="ch01note35"><sup>35</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">American historian Howard Zinn described the capture and journey of Africans to slavery:</p>
<p class="block">The marches to the coast, sometimes for one thousand miles, with people shackled around the neck, under whip and gun, were death marches, in which two of every five blacks died. On the coast, they were kept in cages until they were picked and sold … Then they were packed aboard the slave ships, in spaces not much bigger than coffins, chained together in the dark, wet slime of the ship’s bottom, choking in the stench of their own excrement… On one occasion, hearing a great noise from below decks where the blacks were chained together, the sailors opened the hatches and found the slaves in different stages of suffocation, many dead, some having killed others in desperate attempts to breathe. Slaves often jumped overboard to drown rather than continue their suffering. To one observer a slave-deck was “so covered with blood and mucus that it resembled a slaughter house.”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch01note36" id="ch01note36"><sup>36</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_21"/>These horrors turned into great riches for the wealthy few. In the “new world” of the Americas, slave labor cultivated ever-greater volumes of cotton. Nine thousand bales of cotton in 1791 became half a million in 1822, and five million bales of cotton by 1861.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch01note37" id="ch01note37"><sup>37</sup></a> These exponential increases owed themselves to technological innovations in spinning and weaving, and were harnessed by enslaved Africans, who were, in the words of W. E. B. Du Bois, “bent at the bottom of a growing pyramid of commerce and industry.” Enslaved people “not only could not be spared, if this new economic organization was to expand,” Du Bois continues, “but rather they became the cause of new political demands and alignments, of new dreams of power and visions of empire.” <a href="19_bm006.html#ch01note38" id="ch01note38"><sup>38</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">In the “old world,” this wealth fueled investments that would spur the Industrial Revolution in Britain. The cash reaped from trading enslaved people, and from the products of their labor on sugar and cotton plantations, was the basis for Britain’s banking system, and for investments in many of the laborsaving technologies that propelled British capitalism ahead of the rest. Among others, James Watt’s steam engine was financed by the trade of enslaved people. Trinidadian historian Eric Williams’s famous account of <em>Capitalism and Slavery</em>, described how “the sugar planters were among the first to realize [the steam engine’s] importance.”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch01note39" id="ch01note39"><sup>39</sup></a> The plantations were among the steam engine’s most important market.</p>
<p class="indent">The trade of enslaved people also encouraged the growth of the iron industry, which supplied chains, padlocks, and fetters for the people’s owners, as well as firearms that were traded for enslaved people, and metal used in traders’ ship construction. Likewise, the trade of cotton goods stimulated cotton manufacturing by enslaved Africans, and the sugarcane harvested by their counterparts on plantations in turn drove the growth of sugar refinery in English towns. Nearly all of Britain’s growing towns and cities flourished as a result of slavery—from seaport towns like Liverpool, centered on trade of enslaved people, to manufacturing towns like Lancashire and Manchester.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_22"/>Thus it wasn’t the case that Europe developed capital and industrial growth, while the rest of the world didn’t. But rather, as Walter Rodney put it, Western Europe developed economically by actively <em>underdeveloping</em> Africa and other parts of the colonized world.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch01note40" id="ch01note40"><sup>40</sup></a> The development of “free labor” in Europe needed the decidedly unfree labor of plantations. As Marx wrote, “While the cotton industry introduced child-slavery into England, in the United States it gave the impulse for the transformation of the earlier, more or less patriarchal slavery into a system of commercial exploitation. In fact, the veiled slavery of the wage-laborers in Europe needed the unqualified slavery of the New World as its pedestal.”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch01note41" id="ch01note41"><sup>41</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">Finally, the unfree labor of the enslaved people could only be set to work on land that was stolen. Yet another violent expropriation was required: this time of the indigenous populations in the Americas. The slave plantations and the colonial settlements were built upon over a billion and a half acres of land inhabited by Native American tribes. Their brutal dispossession and ethnic extermination were nothing short of genocidal.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch01note42" id="ch01note42"><sup>42</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">Lest we think the early capitalists piled up their wealth penny by penny, as in Adam Smith’s version of the story, the truth has more to do with conquest, robbery, and pillage—from piracy, to colonialism, to the European Crusades, to the enslavement of Africans.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch01note43" id="ch01note43"><sup>43</sup></a> You can get a picture of how early capital was accumulated by looking at a seventeenth century map of West Africa. You’ll find Ghana, then called the Gold Coast (called such until its independence in 1957). To its west: the Ivory Coast. And to its east: the Slave Coast.</p>
<p class="h3">CONCLUSION</p>
<p class="noindent">In the chapters that follow we will delve into the features that define capitalism—what makes it tick, what slows its ticking. As a starting point, we can see here that capitalism is not an eternal system embedded in our nature. It has a history and an origin, and therefore, it can have an end.</p>
<p class="indent">Just as importantly, as we explore themes of value, exploitation, profits, and the accumulation of capital in future chapters, it will be important to understand these concepts within this historical context. So long as families could produce food and clothing for themselves, they did not have to work for a wage. Once the vast majority of people lost access to their lands, the organizing principles of society would change. Private ownership of lands, resources, and tools was firmly established and concentrated into few hands. On this basis arose wage labor and a dependence on the market for goods and sustenance.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_23"/>We will see that capitalism is not simply an economic or a political structure, but a system of social relationships, whose foundation is the expropriation of masses of people from the land. The power of the few to extract labor and profits from the many is based on a relationship of economic dependence, which is historically conditioned. Turning a profit is only possible on the basis of private ownership of the means of production, a “free” workforce, and a state of the bourgeoisie to enforce and project the power of the new ruling elite.</p>
<p class="indent">Lastly, the fact that the opening shots of capitalism are processes that simultaneously destroy humans and land—expropriation, plunder, slavery, and conquest—give us some indication of what’s to come in regards to oppression and environmental devastation wrought by the system (see sidebar: “Capitalism and Soil”). Both soil and worker had to come under the domination of capital. As Marx described, the theft of common land and the “transformation into modern private property under circumstances of ruthless terrorism … conquered the field for capitalist agriculture, incorporated the soil into capital, and created for the urban industries the necessary supplies of free and rightless proletarians.”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch01note44" id="ch01note44"><sup>44</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">With this historical framework in mind, we’ll look next at the defining building blocks of capitalism, beginning with the commodity, its “elemental form,” according to Marx. We’ll see that once wage labor and markets, which had operated only on the fringes of feudal economies, became central to the economic activity of capitalist economies, they set the rules for how every aspect of the system operates.</p>

<p class="noindent">The violent social transformations that gave birth to capitalism destroyed the traditional ties that existed between humankind and the earth. The forcible expropriation of peasants alienated humanity from the natural world, and led to a “metabolic rift,” as Marx described it, beginning a process that has driven us today to the brink of planetary destruction.</p>
<p class="indent">Labor and the earth constitute society’s “original sources of wealth,” Marx wrote. That is, everything that we require to live and thrive derives from the land and from our ability to do work to harness nature’s great powers. Through the process of labor, a metabolic relationship has bound humans and nature together.</p>
<p class="block">Labor is, first of all, a process between man and nature, a process by which man, through his own actions, mediates, regulates and controls the metabolism between himself and nature. He confronts the materials of nature as a force of nature. He sets in motion the natural forces which belong to his own body, his arms, legs, head and hands, in order to appropriate the materials of nature in a form adapted to his own needs. Through this movement he acts upon external nature and changes it, and in this way he simultaneously changes his own nature.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch01note45" id="ch01note45"><sup>45</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">The enclosures in England put an end to collective use of land, and instead turned both laborers and the natural world into mere inputs for agricultural and industrial production. Marx explained that “for the first time, nature becomes purely an object for humankind, purely a matter of utility; ceases to be recognized as a power for itself; and the theoretical discovery of its autonomous laws appears merely as a ruse so as to subjugate it under human needs, whether as an object of consumption or as a means of production.”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch01note46" id="ch01note46"><sup>46</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">While the masses of people were dispossessed, the land itself was robbed of nutrients as rapidly increasing output of industrial agriculture despoiled the earth. The soil was depleted of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, which reappeared in the cities in the form of urban pollution, simultaneously poisoning the land and the city dwellers. Marx was profoundly disturbed by this development, and considered it a breach in the natural relationship of humans to the earth. In <em>Capital</em>, Marx argued:</p>
<p class="block"><a id="page_25"/>All progress in capitalist agriculture is a progress in the art, not only of robbing the worker, but of robbing the soil; all progress in increasing the fertility of the soil for a given time is progress towards ruining the more long-lasting sources of that fertility … Capitalist production, therefore, only develops the technique and the degree of combination of the social process of production by simultaneously undermining the original sources of all wealth—the soil and the worker.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch01note47" id="ch01note47"><sup>47</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">Since Marx’s and Engels’s time, a far deeper crisis has befallen the earth’s ecosystem. Among our most timely and life-threatening challenges is that of climate change. Fossil fuels, which first became the dominant form of energy during the Industrial Revolution, now dominate the world economy, and threaten our planet’s survival. We’ll discuss some of these critical issues in future chapters. But for the time being we see that capitalism could only break through as a world system on the basis of conquering both humankind and the planet and subjugating both to its profit motive.<a id="page_26"/></p>
