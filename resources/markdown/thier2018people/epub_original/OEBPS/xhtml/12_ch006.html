<p class="chap_title"><strong>CAPITALIST CRISIS</strong></p>
<p class="block">In these crises, there breaks out an epidemic that in all earlier epochs would have seemed an absurdity—the epidemic of over-production. Society suddenly finds itself put back into a state of momentary barbarism; it appears as if a famine, a universal war of devastation, had cut off the supply of every means of subsistence; industry and commerce seem to be destroyed; and why? Because there is too much civilization, too much means of subsistence, too much industry, too much commerce… And how does the bourgeoisie get over these crises? On the one hand by enforced destruction of a mass of productive forces; on the other by the conquest of new markets, and by the more thorough exploitation of the old ones. That is to say, by paving the way for more extensive and more destructive crises, and by diminishing the means whereby crises are prevented.</p>
<p class="blockr"><em>—The Communist Manifesto<a href="19_bm006.html#ch06note1" id="ch06note1"><sup>1</sup></a></em></p>
<p class="h3">A DISTURBED BALANCE</p>
<p class="noindent">We’ve discussed capitalism’s dynamic drive to accumulate, but that is only half the story. If capitalism were simply a “growth engine” then we would see continuous expansion. But in reality, periods of growth give way, in Marx’s words, to momentary barbarism when capitalism goes into crisis. Profitability slows, businesses shutter, debts used to fuel the expansion can no longer be paid. “The chain of payment obligations,” as Marx wrote, suddenly breaks “in a hundred places.”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch06note2" id="ch06note2"><sup>2</sup></a> The system seems to have gone into a state of shock. “All this,” continued Marx, “therefore leads to violent and acute crises, sudden forcible devaluations, an actual stagnation and disruption in the reproduction process, and hence to an actual decline in reproduction.”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch06note3" id="ch06note3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_148"/>We said that competition is capitalism’s beating heart. Profits are its lifeblood. Without them, capital crashes. A breakdown in profitability—whether in a single corporation, or more widely spread out through society—is not an abstract mathematical problem. It takes a punishing toll on people’s lives and leads to staggering levels of devastation.</p>
<p class="indent">What became known as the Great Recession from 2007 to 2009 left in its wake more than nine million foreclosed on US homes. (A decade later only a third of those that lost their homes were reported “likely to become homeowners again.”)<a href="19_bm006.html#ch06note4" id="ch06note4"><sup>4</sup></a> Unemployment figures, which always underestimate true unemployment,<a href="19_bm006.html#ch06note5" id="ch06note5"><sup>5</sup></a> hit 10 percent in 2009, and job growth has since depended on low-wage, temporary work. Meanwhile, banks were bailed out to the tune of trillions, as working-class people were left drowning in debt. A decade after the recession, student loans topped $1.3 trillion, an increase of 120 percent since 2008.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch06note6" id="ch06note6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">Among readers’ stories collected by the <em>Nation</em> during the Great Recession, Joseph, a twenty-nine-year-old veteran of the Iraq War, explained that he graduated college in 2007. In the two years that followed he held two jobs lasting for a total of five months. “I currently am living in my parents’ basement,” Joseph wrote, “where I have to share time on the PS3 [PlayStation 3] with my 55-year-old also unemployed father.”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch06note7" id="ch06note7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">Joshua, another recent college graduate wrote: “A year and a half ago, I was on cloud nine … the very first of my entire immediate and extended family to go to college … That was then. After hundreds of applications and job fairs alike, I was not even given the opportunity for an interview, let alone a full-time job.” Saddled with $65,000 in student loans, and working a part-time job with no benefits, he reported, “I have no health insurance, have high blood pressure, and have to decide whether or not I can afford my medicine or not. I have battled a sickness for the past 2 months, long enough to sacrifice food to save up and go to a clinic. I was diagnosed with walking pneumonia. This is no way to live.”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch06note8" id="ch06note8"><sup>8</sup></a> Of course, for every Joseph and Josh, there are hundreds of thousands more.</p>
<p class="indent">Many regions in the world reckoned with even deeper recessions or depressions, and in some cases, entire countries faced bankruptcy. Workers across the globe were forced to pay the price. In Greece, a quarter of the population remained unemployed for several years, and youth unemployment hit double that rate. Greek workers—along with those in Jamaica, Spain, Ireland, Brazil, Puerto Rico, and other countries—faced crippling austerity measures in order to “service the public debt” of the state.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch06note9" id="ch06note9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_149"/>Despite the widespread turmoil and suffering caused by the financial meltdown, the recession that followed, and the limping “recovery” since, mainstream economists were largely caught flatfooted as to its causes. In the midst of the crisis, former chairman of the Federal Reserve and humble “rock star of economics” Alan Greenspan said he was “in shocked disbelief ”—eventually coming to the conclusion that the crisis was precipitated by an inexplicable “once in a century credit tsunami.”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch06note10" id="ch06note10"><sup>10</sup></a> Economist Eugene Fama, considered the “father of the efficient market hypothesis” (essentially the idea that markets are fully democratic and always lead to the “correct” economic outcomes), said: “We don’t know what causes recessions. I’m not a macroeconomist, so I don’t feel bad about that! We’ve never known. Debates go on to this day about what caused the Great Depression. Economics is not very good at explaining swings in economic activity.”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch06note11" id="ch06note11"><sup>11</sup></a> (See sidebar: “Why Mainstream Economists Get It Wrong.”)</p>
<p class="indent">For Marxists, understanding the system’s propensity to break down is central to our analysis of capitalism, as well as the potential for its revolutionary overthrow. We’ve seen that at its best, a “healthy” capitalist economy depends on exploitation, poverty, oppression, and environmental destruction in order to function. But even this “health” gives rise to contradictions, which are only resolved through crises. As Marx put it: “Crises are never more than momentary, violent solutions for the existing contradictions, violent eruptions that reestablish the disturbed balance for the time being.”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch06note12" id="ch06note12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">Mainstream economic analysis starts and ends at the surface of the economy—price fluctuations, monetary policy, and financial markets. But Marxists argue that crises originate at the system’s core and are not imposed on the system from outside. Capitalism’s own process of accumulation—the very thing that drives it forward—also undermines it from within. As Marxist sociologist Simon Clarke explained, “For Marx crises were not exceptional periods in which a normal, uncontradictory, pattern of accumulation breaks down, but the most dramatic expression of the inherently contradictory foundations of accumulation.”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch06note13" id="ch06note13"><sup>13</sup></a> Understanding capitalist crisis is central to the theory and politics of revolutionary Marxism. The volatility and destruction brought upon by endemic, periodic crises make capitalism a fundamentally precarious system, and at the same time open the way toward class struggle and the potential for revolution.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_150"/>Below, we will outline in broad brushstrokes the contradictions embedded within the process of capital accumulation. With these contradictions in mind, we’ll then describe the form that crises often take under capitalism. Finally, the chapter ends by taking up longer-term tendencies that may contribute to periodic crises, but also play a role in undermining the stability and integrity of the system as a whole.</p>
<div class="box3">
<p class="box-head">WHY MAINSTREAM ECONOMISTS GET IT WRONG</p>
<p class="noindent">Despite the regular occurrence of disruptive crises throughout the history of capitalism, bourgeois economics by and large denies that crises are intrinsic to the system. The market self-corrects, and crises are aberrations, exceptional departures from the norm. With every boom, amnesia sets in about the devastation wrought by the previous recession, and apologists for capitalism claim that the boom-and bust-cycle have been overcome. Yet when the boom goes bust, economists and mainstream commentators are dumbfounded, grappling for particular and exceptional explanations of what went wrong. As Simon Clarke put it:</p>
<p class="block">The crisis of the early nineteen nineties was the result of the incautious lending of the nineteen eighties. The crisis of the early nineteen eighties was the result of excessive state spending in the late nineteen seventies. The crisis of the mid nineteen seventies was the result of the oil price hike and the inflationary financing of the Vietnam War … the crisis of the nineteen thirties was the result of inappropriate banking policies … Every crisis has a different cause, all of which boil down to human failure, none of which are attributed to the capitalist system itself.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch06note14" id="ch06note14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">“After two hundred years of repeating this nonsense,” Clarke continued, “one would have expected that the economists would have begun to smell a rat. The economists’ explanation of crises is as if a scientist were to deny that the recurrence of the seasons was a natural phenomenon, attributing the return of spring each year to the whim of a supernatural force.”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch06note15" id="ch06note15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_151"/>Mainstream economists were largely at a loss to explain the financial meltdown of 2007 to 2008 and the recession that followed. Eugene Fama insisted that there was no crisis in the housing or credit markets because markets are fully democratic and driven by rational economic actors, and thus always lead to the “correct” outcomes.</p>
<p class="indent">Another school of thought, known as chaos and behavioral theory, attributes movements in the economy to “animal spirits.”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch06note16" id="ch06note16"><sup>16</sup></a> Unlike Fama’s theory, economic players are here assumed to be driven not by rational behavior, but by animalistic impulses, which can fly out of control and have the potential to create massive fluctuations and disruptions in the system. These animal spirits include things like overconfidence and corruption. (Characteristics which, incidentally, animals are not known to exhibit.) In the 1990s, Alan Greenspan added to the lexicon “irrational exuberance.”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch06note17" id="ch06note17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">Then there are popular weather pattern explanations, which go back to neoclassical economist William Jevons who hypothesized that the number of sunspots help create a business cycle.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch06note18" id="ch06note18"><sup>18</sup></a> Many contemporary versions of this exist, including a paper by two American economists called “Good Day Sunshine: Stock Returns and the Weather,” which studied sunniness and cloud patters at twenty-six cities around the world for fifteen years to find that sunny days often translated to better stock trading patterns.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch06note19" id="ch06note19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">Beyond poking fun at economists, the question remains as to why their theories fail to properly analyze—or in many cases recognize—the occurrence of economic crises in the system. One of the most important foundations of bourgeois economics is known as “Say’s Law,” which originated with the classical economist Jean-Baptiste Say. Say’s Law argues that supply and demand exist in equilibrium. There may be occasional disruptions to that symmetry, but the market eventually evens them out. Say’s assumption is that supply always creates an equal demand because every time a capitalist produces and sells a commodity, he then turns around and uses that money to buy someone else’s product. In <em>A Treatise on Political Economy</em>, Say argued:</p>
<p class="block"><a id="page_152"/>It is worthwhile to remark, that a product is no sooner created, than it, from that instant, affords a market for other products to the full extent of its own value. When the producer has put the finishing hand to his product, he is most anxious to sell it immediately, lest its value should diminish in his hands. Nor is he less anxious to dispose of the money he may get for it; for the value of money is also perishable. But the only way of getting rid of money is in the purchase of some product or other. Thus the mere circumstance of creation of one product immediately opens a vent for other products.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch06note20" id="ch06note20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<p class="noindent">That is to say, the prospect of the value of commodities and money declining over time compels producers to both sell and buy as quickly as possible. In reality the purpose of money is to <em>not</em> be perishable. As we discussed in chapter three, money can be used to hold on to value over time. Its value may go up or down.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch06note21" id="ch06note21"><sup>21</sup></a> And capitalists often sit on the profits they’ve made—or use it to pay back their debts—if it doesn’t look like investment will turn out a profit.</p>
<p class="indent">Say’s Law is predicated on the assumption that goods will be sold, thus creating the funds that can then be used to purchase other commodities. But this is not the case. As Engels put it: “The economist comes along with his lovely theory of demand and supply, proves to you that ‘one can never produce too much,’ and practice replies with trade crises, which reappear as regularly as the comets.”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch06note22" id="ch06note22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">Thus while profits recovered after the financial meltdown of 2008, investment in real production did not materialize for some years. Despite massive infusions of taxpayer money to banks, auto companies, and other corporations via government bailouts, capitalists by and large saw an excess capacity of goods and decided to hold on to cash rather than spend it. Before 2008, about 40 percent of investment in the US was going toward construction in housing. But for years after the crisis, no one invested in building more houses because there was an oversupply.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch06note23" id="ch06note23"><sup>23</sup></a> Jump ahead a decade and profits have recovered but investment has not.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch06note24" id="ch06note24"><sup>24</sup></a> As Marxist economist Doug Henwood explained, instead, “they’ve been shipping out gobs of money to their shareholders—an average of $1.2 trillion a year since 2015.”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch06note25" id="ch06note25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_153"/>This is what Marx had in mind when responding to Say’s Law, he wrote: “Nothing can be more foolish than the dogma that because every sale is a purchase, and every purchase a sale, the circulation of commodities necessarily implies an equilibrium between sales and purchase. If this means that the number of actual sales accomplished is equal to the number of purchases, it is a flat tautology. But its real intention is to show that every seller brings his own buyer to the market with him.” Nothing of the kind, answered Marx: “No one can sell unless someone else purchases. But no one directly <em>needs</em> to purchase because he has just sold.”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch06note26" id="ch06note26"><sup>26</sup></a> [emphasis added.]</p>
<p class="indent">As we discussed previously, the separation of the manufacture of goods from their direct consumption through an intermediary stop of sale on the market leaves open the potential for a breakdown in the conversion of the production of goods to their realization in sales. “Circulation,” continued Marx,</p>
<p class="block">bursts through all the temporal, spatial and personal barriers imposed by the direct exchange of products, and it does this by splitting up… into the two antithetical segments of sale and purchase… If the assertion of their external independence proceeds to a certain critical point, their unity violently makes itself felt by producing—a crisis.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch06note27" id="ch06note27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">One of the critiques against Say’s law to emerge <em>within</em> mainstream economics was developed and popularized by John Maynard Keynes.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch06note28" id="ch06note28"><sup>28</sup></a> Keynes accepted many of the basic assumptions of the neoclassical school, but he recognized that the real world often reveals disequilibrium between supply and demand, and that this can produce great crises and ruptures within the system. Keynes conceptualized capitalism as a system for the distribution and consumption of goods—thus focusing on effective demand. Along with his contemporary counterparts—people like Paul Krugman, Joseph Stiglitz, and Jeffrey Sachs—Keynes argued for state intervention and government spending as a way to create jobs and increase workers’ ability to spend and consume, thereby returning supply and demand to a state of equilibrium.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_154"/>Although Keynesian economists offer an explanation of crises as inherent to the system, ultimately, since Keynes did not see growth or profits as essential to the system, he assumed regulation could provide a means to reassert the harmony of capitalism. But capitalism is not a system of distribution and consumption; it is a system of profit maximization. There are times where it is quite logical for capitalists, from their perspective, not to expand production, and even to prefer recessions and economic “shock therapies”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch06note29" id="ch06note29"><sup>29</sup></a> when it is in the interest of capital as a whole.</p>
<p class="indent">Keynes’s ideas remained within the framework of helping capitalism to run more smoothly, and have in any case largely been pushed to the sidelines in mainstream economic discussions. Crises—even ones as big as the Great Recession—are once again seen as aberrations. Ultimately, whether one considers crises to be caused by external shocks (like Greenspan’s credit tsunami), or by a lack of effective demand caused by improper management (such as would be argued by Keynes), in either case, they are seen as departures from an otherwise healthy system.</p>
<p class="indent">Whatever the different theories and explanations (or in many cases non-explanations) of crises advanced by bourgeois economics, their method begins with analyzing surface data in the form of prices, and from there conclusions are drawn about market performance and profits. It logically follows then that economic crises are understood to originate from the surface of the system: monetary policy, issues of credit, and financial markets, rather than from their roots in production and capital accumulation. As Marx eloquently summarized in <em>Theories of Surplus Value:</em></p>
<p class="block">The constant recurrence of crises has in fact reduced the rigmarole of Say and others to a phraseology which is now only used in times of prosperity but is cast aside in times of crises. In the crises of the world market, the contradictions and antagonisms of bourgeois production are strikingly revealed. Instead of investigating the nature of the conflicting elements which erupt in the catastrophe, the apologists content themselves with denying the catastrophe itself and insisting, in the face of their regular and periodic recurrence, that if production were carried on according to the textbooks, crises would never occur. Thus the apologetics consist in the falsification of the simplest economic relations, and particularly in clinging to the concept of unity in the face of contradiction.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch06note30" id="ch06note30"><sup>30</sup></a></p>
</div>
<p class="h3"><a id="page_155"/>THE CONTRADICTIONS OF ACCUMULATION</p>
<p class="noindent">First and foremost, we know that capital accumulation is driven not by needs but by profits—that is, not by the <em>creation of use-values</em>, but by the <em>realization of exchange-value</em>. It is not enough for capital to be employed in order to produce commodities (M-C), but those commodities must then be converted to profit (C-M’). As Marxist Duncan Foley put it: “The production and distribution of use-values is an incidental by-product of this pursuit of value.”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch06note31" id="ch06note31"><sup>31</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">Were it the case that the construction of housing was driven by people’s needs to have proper shelter, it wouldn’t be that difficult for society to determine how many houses are required, and then to employ the workers necessary to build them. But the homebuilding and real estate industries have no interest in building homes to shelter people who cannot pay for them. Marx explained:</p>
<p class="block">It should never be forgotten that the production of this surplus value—and the transformation of a proportion of it back into capital, or accumulation, forms an integral part of surplus value—is the immediate purpose and the determining motive of capitalist production. Capitalist production, therefore, should never be depicted as something that it is not, i.e., as production whose immediate purpose is consumption.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch06note32" id="ch06note32"><sup>32</sup></a></p>
<p class="noindent">Rather than needs, investment in construction is driven by market prices and profits. And there is no guarantee that the houses built—no matter how desperately needed—will be profitably sold.</p>
<p class="indent">The creation of surplus value through the exploitation of labor, and the realization of surplus value in exchange are two different actions. Capitalism first separates the production of goods from their consumption through an intermediary stop of sale in exchange for money. These processes therefore occur at different times and places, and the time lag separating them is precisely what leaves open the potential for a breakdown in the conversion of the manufacture of goods to their realization in sales.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_156"/>Second, because capitalists must continually expand production on pain of extinction, any limitations to expansion are seen simply as barriers to be overcome. This drive to produce, accumulate, and reinvest is done without system-wide planning, and with little regard to the limits of the market. Production and consumption are, in Marx’s words, “not only separate in time and space, they are also separate in theory.” As we’ll discuss below, the laws that govern each are distinct and often conflicting. Marx explained: “The former is restricted only by the society’s productive forces, the latter by the proportionality between the different branches of production and by the society’s power of consumption. And this is determined… within a given framework of antagonistic conditions of distribution, which reduce the consumption of the vast majority of society to a minimum level.”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch06note33" id="ch06note33"><sup>33</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">In previous societies, supply and demand were more or less in proportion because supply was determined by demand. “It was demand that dominated supply, preceded it. Production followed close on the heels of consumption. [Now] large-scale industry, forced by the very instruments at its disposal to produce at an ever-increasing scale, can no longer wait for demand. Production precedes consumption, supply compels demand.”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch06note34" id="ch06note34"><sup>34</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">Recall our discussion of Ford’s assembly line in chapter five. In the 1910s, Ford revolutionized car manufacture by vastly reducing the amount of time required to make each car. Prices for the new Model Ts were half of those of their predecessors. It was not a sudden desire for cars that produced this innovation. Rather the innovation was motivated by the need to push out competitors through cheaper prices. Once prices were reduced, cars became accessible to masses of people, thereby <em>creating</em> a new market and thus greater demand.</p>
<p class="indent">Third, advances in productivity necessitate ever-increasing investment in laborsaving technologies. As these technologies squeeze out the number of workers employed relative to machines, we’ll see below how the part of capital that produces surplus value (labor) diminishes relative to capital invested in the means of production. While individual capitalists gain in the short-term by increasing productivity, the long-term implications of this compulsion create instability in the system.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_157"/>Finally, all of these contradictions are further exacerbated by the slow speed at which market conditions are evaluated and at which production quotas can be adjusted accordingly. Changes in demand are only signaled through fluctuations in prices and profits. But these fluctuations themselves only happen once imbalances in production and exchange have already developed beyond a certain point. Capitalists necessarily respond after the fact, and do so slowly, as large-scale investments can’t simply be erected and destroyed overnight.</p>
<p class="h3">POVERTY AMID PLENTY</p>
<p class="noindent">We’ve seen that competition forces each capitalist to “accumulate for accumulation’s sake.” Every industry does not collectively take stock of the need (and, more importantly for capital, the ability to pay) for the goods that they produce. Rather, each company is concerned with expanding <em>their individual share</em> of the market. In order to do so they must drive down prices through increases in productivity. Marx wrote: “The market … must be continually extended, so that its relationships and the conditions governing them assume ever more the form of a natural law independent of the producers and become ever more uncontrollable.”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch06note35" id="ch06note35"><sup>35</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">The extension of the scale of production must, of course, lead to a greater volume of goods. If Ford were to cut the prices of automobiles in half but still sell the same number of cars that had been sold before, it would result in half as much money earned in sales! Instead, Ford could gain market share by cutting prices in half, while doubling (or tripling) the number of cars produced. This way the company is assured a greater costumer-base and greater profits. Otherwise, what would be the point of gains in productivity?</p>
<p class="indent">As Simon Clarke wrote: “The result of these efforts is that the capitalists throw an increasing mass of commodities onto the market. However, this increase in production has not been motivated by a desire to meet expanding demand, but by a desire to increase the production of surplus value.”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch06note36" id="ch06note36"><sup>36</sup></a> This compulsion creates a tendency for capitalists to overproduce—for production to run ahead of demand, often way beyond what the market can absorb.</p>
<p class="indent">Any limits that consumptive demand imposes on the expansion of capital are seen as obstacles to overcome. Capitalists never take these conditions as given, but rather confront these challenges by means of further increases to productivity, the intensification of labor, and conquering new markets. In other words, capital confronts the limits of the market by producing even more. As Marx argued:</p>
<p class="block"><a id="page_158"/>When considering the production process we saw that the whole aim of capitalist production is appropriation of the greatest possible amount of surplus-labor, in other words, the realization of the greatest possible amount of immediate labor-time with the given capital, be it through the prolongation of the labor-day or the reduction of the necessary labor-time, through the development of the productive power of labor by means of co-operation, division of labor, machinery etc., in short, large-scale production, i.e., mass production. It is thus in the nature of capitalist production, to produce without regard to the limits of the market.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch06note37" id="ch06note37"><sup>37</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">Or as Engels put more succinctly: The expansion of production “laughs at all resistance.”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch06note38" id="ch06note38"><sup>38</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">One outcome of this tendency is that while the forces of production seem to know no bounds, the ability of workers to <em>buy</em> increasing masses of goods that we ourselves have created, is limited. Our wages sadly do not have the same expanding quality as capital; quite the contrary, they are under constant pressure to be reduced. Thus demand for consumer goods can have a hard time keeping up with supply. In Marx’s words: “since capital’s purpose is not the satisfaction of needs but the production of profit … there must be a constant tension between the restricted dimensions of consumption on the capitalist basis, and a production that is constantly striving to overcome these immanent barriers.”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch06note39" id="ch06note39"><sup>39</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">Yet, in and of itself, this dynamic is not enough to throw the system into crisis because capitalists don’t just produce commodities for workers to consume. (See sidebar: “The Problem with Theories of ‘Underconsumption.’”) They also produce luxury goods for the rich, and more importantly, raw materials and means of production for <em>other</em> productive capitalists. The key commodities that drive our economy are indeed oil, steel, and other goods necessary to fuel production. These markets keep expanding as long as money is being made and investment continues to move forward. “When we consider the accumulation process as a whole,” wrote Clarke, “it is clear that the expansion of production in one branch of production expands the market for another, so that the ‘balanced growth’ of production remains a formal possibility.”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch06note40" id="ch06note40"><sup>40</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">Nevertheless, this expansion happens unevenly and in an unplanned way. Every industry is susceptible to a variety of natural, technical, or social limits to manufacture and exchange. Raw materials, for instance, make up a good deal of production costs for industries. Consider the consequences of a contracting supply of natural gasses. This will increase the price of oil as an input to production. (On the other hand, new advances in oil extraction processes will cheapen the inputs). Weather conditions too—and increasingly global warming—can have drastic impacts on crops, such as corn, grain, or cotton, which are central to many branches of production. A sharp rise in the price of cotton due to drought conditions will impact the production of goods that require cotton as a raw material—from textiles, to livestock feed, to food products.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_159"/>Unexpected changes in the limits or affordability of production inputs can give way to certain branches of production producing far beyond the limits of the market, while other branches may fall short of producing enough to meet growing demands. These asymmetries across branches of industries, often referred to by Marxists as “disproportionalities,” can easily lead to an overproduction of goods in one or another branch of production, relative to the supply needs of other connected industries. If this happens in a key industry (say auto or oil, as opposed to lollipop production), the interdependence of capital makes it easy to see how <small>OVERPRODUCTION</small> can become generalized across the economy.</p>
<p class="indent">Marx used the example of Calico, a type of cotton, to make the point in <em>Theories of Surplus Value.</em> A glut in the calico industry would hamper the ability of a weaver to sell his goods at their value. Argued Marx:</p>
<p class="block">This disturbance first affects his workers. Thus they are now to a smaller extent, or not at all, consumers of his commodity—cotton cloth—and of other commodities which entered into their consumption. It is true, that they need cotton cloth, but they cannot buy it because they have not the means, and they have not the means because they cannot continue to produce and they cannot continue to produce because too much has been produced, too much cotton cloth is already on the market. [Referring to David Ricardo’s argument for why the market will naturally fix any imbalances:] Neither Ricardo’s advice “to increase their production,” nor his alternative “to produce something else” can help them. They now form a part of the temporary surplus population, of the surplus production of workers [i.e. the unemployed], in this case of cotton producers, because there is a surplus production of cotton fabrics on the market.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch06note41" id="ch06note41"><sup>41</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">But apart from these workers, Marx went on to explain, an interruption in the weaving of calico hits those businesses (and likewise their workers) who have any connection to the production of cotton: agricultural workers that grow cotton, engineers of spindles and looms, iron and coal producers, and so on.</p>
<p class="blocka"><a id="page_160"/>Reproduction in all these spheres would also be impeded because the reproduction of cotton cloth is a condition for their own reproduction. This would happen even if they had not <em>over-produced</em> in their own spheres, that is to say, had not produced beyond the limit set and justified by the cotton industry when it was working smoothly … They are now, all of a sudden, <em>relatively</em> over-produced, because the means with which to buy them and therefore the demand for them, have contracted.</p>
<p class="block1">If over-production has taken place not only in cotton, but also in linen, silk and woolen fabrics, then it can be understood how over-production in these few, but leading articles, calls forth a more or less general (<em>relative</em>) over-production on the whole market. On the one hand there is a superabundance of all the means of reproduction and a superabundance of all kinds of unsold commodities on the market. On the other hand bankrupt capitalists and destitute, starving workers.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch06note42" id="ch06note42"><sup>42</sup></a></p>
<p class="noindent1">A more modern-day example of oil makes the same point. If refineries sit idle because there is an overproduction of oil, the workers are laid off, and the creditors, who financed the investment, are dragged down as well. But as future oil extraction and refining projects are pulled back, so too are demand for the raw materials (steel, concrete, plastics, electricity, etc.) and engineering necessary for the production of oil rigs, pipelines, and so on. The construction business, and service and retail companies, which had benefitted from the springing up of oil boomtowns, suffer as well. (See sidebar: “Over-production; The Case of Oil.”) In this way what may begin as overproduction in just one or a couple of industries, can spread and become a more general crisis in the system.</p>
<p class="indent">A generalized “crisis of overproduction” leads to absurd and tragic conclusions. Previous societies suffered from crises of scarcity when plagues, famine, or wars destroyed the ability of society to adequately produce necessities for the majority of people. Yet economic crises under capitalism are not the result of too few goods, but of too few <em>profits</em>. In other words, as we’ve said, capital is not concerned with the consumption of use-values, but with the production of exchange-value and the realization of profits through its sale. As Ernest Mandel put it: “Pre-capitalist crisis is a crisis of <em>under-production of use-values</em>… A capitalist crisis, however, is a crisis of <em>overproduction of exchange-values</em>.”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch06note43" id="ch06note43"><sup>43</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">As a result, we see an overproduction not of things that are <em>needed</em>, but an overproduction of what can be <em>profitably sold</em>—whether these are tangible goods, or (as we’ll discuss in the next chapter) complicated financial cocktails. This is what mainstream economists refer to as “effective demand.” Effective because there are dollars behind the need for this or that good. So, for instance, a “surplus” of housing is part of what led to the recession that began in 2008. But this is not because there isn’t a need for homes! It’s just that people don’t have the <em>money to buy</em> those homes. Marx wrote:</p>
<p class="block"><a id="page_161"/>It is not that too many means of subsistence are produced in relation to the existing population. On the contrary. Too little is produced to satisfy the mass of the population in an adequate and humane way… Secondly, not enough means of production are produced to allow the whole potential working population to work under the most productive conditions… It is not that too much wealth is produced. But from time to time, too much wealth is produced in its capitalist, antagonistic forms.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch06note44" id="ch06note44"><sup>44</sup></a></p>
<p class="noindent">From here proceeds a downward spiral in which profits tank, businesses and creditors go bust, and workers lose their jobs.</p>
<div class="box3">
<p class="box-head"><strong>THE PROBLEM WITH THEORIES OF “UNDERCONSUMPTION”</strong></p>
<p class="noindent">Theories based on “underconsumption” argue that the working class is paid too little in the form of wages, and therefore workers’ demand cannot keep up with a continually expanding supply. Underconsumption sounds like it should be the other side of the overproduction coin, and some of Marx’s writing, taken in isolation, has been interpreted to make this point. In <em>Theories of Surplus Value</em>, for instance, he argued:</p>
<p class="block">Over-production is specifically conditioned by the general law of the production of capital: to produce to the limit set by the productive forces, that is to say, to exploit the maximum amount of labor with the given amount of capital, without any consideration for the actual limits of the market or the needs backed by the ability to pay; and this is carried out through continuous expansion of reproduction and accumulation, and therefore constant reconversion of revenue into capital, while on the other hand, the mass of the producers remain tied to the average level of needs, and must remain tied to it according to the nature of capitalist production.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch06note45" id="ch06note45"><sup>45</sup></a></p>
<p class="noindent">That is to say, capitalist production tends to accumulate and expand, while workers’ consumptive abilities are constrained by capital’s hunger for maximum exploitation. Therefore, it would seem supply would always exceed demand.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_162"/>Yet if it were the case that capitalism depended on workers’ consumption to survive, it would not only be prone to crises, it would fail to function at all. The fact that many commodities remain out of reach for much of the working class is a constant feature of life under capitalism, during booms and busts alike. As an article in <em>Socialist Voice</em> put it: “If underconsumption were the cause of crises, then crisis would not be cyclical but permanent.”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch06note46" id="ch06note46"><sup>46</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">The logical implication of theories of underconsumption is that capitalists could be convinced to follow their own self-interest and invest in jobs and higher pay so that workers could purchase more goods and keep supply and demand in equilibrium. But in actuality many crises arise just when workers’ wages are at a high point and unemployment is at a low. As Marx argued:</p>
<p class="block">It is pure tautology to say that crises are provoked by a lack of effective demand or effective consumption… The fact that commodities are unsaleable means no more than that no effective buyers have been found for them… If the attempt is made to give this tautology the semblance of greater profundity, by the statement that the working class receives too small a portion of its own product, and that the evil would be remedied if it received a bigger share, i.e., if its wages rose, we need only note that crises are always prepared by a period in which wages generally rise, and the working class actually does receive a greater share in the part of the annual product destined for consumption. From the standpoint of these advocates of sound and “simple” (!) common sense, such periods should rather avert the crisis. It thus appears that capitalist production involves certain conditions independent of people’s good or bad intentions, which permit the relative prosperity of the working class only temporarily, and moreover always as a harbinger of crisis.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch06note47" id="ch06note47"><sup>47</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">In fact, Marx was clear that capitalists are compelled to produce <em>not</em> because of the demands of consumption, but because of the drive to appropriate surplus value. That surplus value in turn is used to accumulate further capital. Profits therefore enter back into the production process, employing additional labor and means of production. So long as there are outlets for profitable investment to be made, these will provide a demand for manufacturing equipment, software, and other means of production. In a nutshell, capitalists do not just produce commodities meant for working-class (or middle-class or capitalist) consumption, but also the means of production.</p>
</div>
<p class="h3"><a id="page_163"/>WHAT GOES BOOM…</p>
<p class="noindent">To see how crises unfold, let’s start with a “healthy” economy in which profits are strong and capitalists readily expand production, invest in new technologies, and employ more workers. Times are good for business, and some sections of the working class will likely see a rise in living standards (though many workers—disproportionately people of color, immigrants, women—will just as surely be left behind). We’re usually told at this point that good times are here to stay and crises are a thing of the past.</p>
<p class="indent">A low level of unemployment gives workers greater bargaining power to demand higher wages. These workers are in turn more likely to buy goods and services. And <em>productive</em> goods—the means of production—are in high demand as well, as businesses eager to get in on rising profits invest in more machinery, technology, and raw materials. Because investment is expanding quickly, <em>demand for such goods typically outstrips supply</em>. Companies which produce the means of production race to keep up with demand, and to capture as much of the expanding market’s share as possible.</p>
<p class="indent">Businesses hustle to produce more, knowing that it is likely that their goods will find buyers. And those firms that invest most quickly in laborsaving technology will be able produce goods most cheaply. Since markets are undersaturated, and since they were among the first to cheapen the cost of production, they won’t need to fight hard for buyers. Instead of reflecting lower production costs in reduced prices for consumers, they can pocket the difference between the manufacturing expenditures and average sale prices. Thus they will enjoy “superprofits” while their competitors, using older means of production, maintain average profitability. And, as we’ve said, these cheaper costs of production will also compel the manufacture of a greater <em>mass</em> of goods.</p>
<p class="indent">Every industry in which investment rises will spur demand in other related industries. The housing market will drive a need for construction, which in turn will spur demand for wood, cement, and other raw materials, as well as household appliances and goods. The newly employed construction workers and service employees at Bed Bath &amp; Beyond, Target, and others, will also fuel the purchase of other consumer goods.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_164"/>Demand for new means of production in nearly every industry rises. Yet the expansion is never rapid enough to satisfy capital’s needs. This is because the more developed capitalism is, the more production depends on complex equipment and technologies. In the past if you wanted to produce more shirts, you just needed to acquire more handlooms, but now increased production necessitates investment in technologies that require a longer period of time to construct. It is thus impossible for the system to quickly adjust to new levels of demand. As a young Bolshevik economist, Pavel Maksakovsky, wrote:</p>
<p class="block">Whatever capitalism’s capacity for significant expansion might be, it is not able “suddenly” to satisfy the massive demand that results from moral wear of existing equipment [the need to update technology/machinery]. As a result, the available supply of commodities lags behind the growing demand, and the tendency towards “equilibrium” comes to a halt. It is not possible to “rectify” production speedily as the disruptions occur. On the contrary, the further the expansion develops, the more aggregate supply lags behind demand, and the greater is the detachment of market prices from values.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch06note48" id="ch06note48"><sup>48</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">In other words, at this point in the cycle, the limits of the market have not yet been reached. Quite the contrary, growing demand and lagging supply during the expansion has the added effect of driving up prices. Capitalists facing a growing market can get away with charging more, and in this way the cost of goods can become increasingly detached from base values. This, in turn, creates a greater incentive to invest: there’s more money to be made! Add to this perfect storm of expansion the force of financial speculation (which we’ll discuss in the next chapter) and prices can fly way off kilter.</p>
<p class="indent">But there are two problems brewing within this storm. The first, as we’ve said, is that expansion is driven by the need to maximize profits, not by “effective demand.” But a lack of demand eventually asserts itself, whether capitalists like it or not. If no one buys the goods, surplus value is produced but not realized.</p>
<p class="indent">This leads to a second problem. As Maksakovsky’s quote above implies, there is a time lag between a market’s saturation point and its reflection in prices and a further lag in the adjustment of production quotas after prices drop. Market prices are capitalists’ only guide to reading demand. Richard Day, a professor of political economy at University of Toronto, explained: “The cyclical movement necessarily arises from the fact that <em>today’s prices</em>, leaving aside speculation, are merely a ‘snapshot’ of the consequences of <em>past actions</em>. Even more irrational is the fact that today’s prices, in determining <em>today’s investments</em>, also determine <em>tomorrow’s production.”</em><a href="19_bm006.html#ch06note49" id="ch06note49"><sup>49</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_165"/>Overproduction of goods in branches of industry that are tied to consumer goods very clearly run up against the limits of the market. As we’ve noted, since working-class income will never expand at the same pace as the growth of production, the gap between production and consumption will eventually make itself known. But the further the industry is from consumer demands, the more easily does expansion run amuck. Those branches of industry that produce the necessary materials for other industries engage in a self-arming frenzy: corporations supply each other with goods for production, great profits are realized, in turn leading to even greater demand, and evermore production. The longer the period of time that it takes to build and deliver machinery, the greater the degree to which production can expand without hitting up against the limitations of the market.</p>
<p class="indent">“The growth of consumer demand,” wrote Maksakovsky, “can be compared to throwing a stone into the water, causing ripples to spread continuously outward. The further the ripples spread, the further removed from consumption are the production branches that are affected.”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch06note50" id="ch06note50"><sup>50</sup></a></p>
<p class="h3">… MUST GO BUST</p>
<p class="noindent">Alas, the fever pitch of expansion eventually oversaturates the market. Too many goods have been produced to be able to sell at the exaggerated prices produced by the boom, or even at their value. Profits begin to tumble. Marx wrote:</p>
<p class="block">Crises are usually preceded by a general inflation in prices of all articles of capitalist production. All of them therefore participate in the subsequent crash and at their former prices they cause a glut in the market. The market can absorb a larger volume of commodities at falling prices, at prices which have fallen below their cost-prices, than it could absorb at their former prices. The excess of commodities is always relative; in other words, it is an excess at particular prices. The prices at which the commodities are then absorbed are ruinous for the producer or merchant.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch06note51" id="ch06note51"><sup>51</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">That is to say, the inflation of prices hits a point at which they threaten effective demand, much as rising real estate prices during the housing boom of the mid-2000s gave way to foreclosures and plummeting demand.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch06note52" id="ch06note52"><sup>52</sup></a> Once they do, the low prices at which excess supply must be sold off devastate the profits of business. Yet even at this point, competition exerts itself more strongly and capitalists are slow to pull back on their investments. As the pressures of overproduction squeeze industry, competition between the capitalists of that field increases and the compulsion to expand the production of surplus value enforces itself. A timid approach is anathema to capital. As Argentinian Marxist Claudio Katz put it: “The law of rising profits prevented them from adopting a conservative attitude in the proper moment… What seems rational after the explosion is discarded beforehand so as to not lose opportunities for profit.”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch06note53" id="ch06note53"><sup>53</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_166"/>There are several reasons why capitalists do not draw down production levels once the market is saturated. In part, as we’ve said, they don’t know exactly when this happens. Once they do, they can’t adjust production levels immediately. Economists William Foster and Waddill Catchings explained it this way: “When this point comes, few men are aware of the fact, because the volume of commodities offered for sale does not indicate either the large volume in the making of the invisible supply in the hands of the speculators… on account of the time it takes to produce commodities and get them into the shops, the markets do not feel the full effects of maximum productivity until months after that stage has been reached. Production, therefore, continues at a high rate; and the volume of commodities coming upon the market, as a result of loans previously made, continues to increase.”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch06note54" id="ch06note54"><sup>54</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">The lack of effective means to read the market and to correct production quotas accordingly aren’t the only reasons that capitalists don’t draw down production. During the boom, prices rise fantastically, responding to increasing demand and lagging supply. When prices fall just as dramatically, no player is willing to leave the table and give up market shares to their rivals. Instead they must jockey for their cut of a dwindling market and wait for their competitors to give ground. This dynamic plays out all the more so because during the boom, corporations invested heavily in new machinery and technologies. Letting these new investments go unused means losing more profit. Because the value of machinery depreciates over time, even if businesses resume production in the future, the value that the machines will pass on to the goods produced will have been diminished.</p>
<p class="indent">Lastly, those capitalists using more advanced methods of production achieved superprofits during the boom. Once the market is saturated, they can lower their price to increase market share and still maintain profitability. These capitalists are likely to <em>expand</em> production further in order to capitalize as rapidly as possibly on market opportunities while they still exist. Even those capitalists whose production methods are lagging behind are likely to try whatever it takes—cut wages, intensify production, close down less profitable wings—in order to weather the storm while giving up as little market share as possible. Never content to let profitability dry up, capitalists keep pushing the market further, delve deeper into the pockets of credit, and intensify exploitation. “Capitalist production,” wrote Marx, “seeks continually to overcome these immanent barriers, but overcomes them only by means which again place these barriers in its way and on a more formidable scale.”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch06note55" id="ch06note55"><sup>55</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_167"/>Thus the necessary “adjustments” in levels of production take months or years to take place. As they do, they will wreak havoc on countless lives in their wake. Eventually a crisis of overproduction appears to be a can that can no longer be kicked down the road. A glutted market drives down prices and capitalists must try to get rid of their commodities. The diminishing returns on their investments finally lead to a pulling back on investment, and a downward spiral begins. Just as the overproduction of goods in one or more key industries can spill over to other related industries, so too does a retreat in one branch have a ripple effect on other industries.</p>
<p class="indent">If auto factories draw down production, the demand for rubber and steel that goes into making cars also drops. Workers at auto, rubber, and steel factories, among others, are laid off and this limits their ability to buy more cars and other commodities. Thus discussing the future of diesel cars, for instance, the <em>Financial Times</em> warned of the “cascading effect” for parts suppliers and slackening demand for wires, door handles, air conditioners, and plastic components. “Any prolonged slump,” the article continued, “would rebound around the interconnected web of European car parts manufacturers, damaging economies, exports and outputs across the European Union.”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch06note56" id="ch06note56"><sup>56</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">Now, rather than a self-arming frenzy of investments, production and financing will stiffen. Factories go idle. Capitalists sit on cash. While mainstream economists insist that supply must always equal demand because for every sale there is a purchase, and for every purchase a sale, reality proves otherwise. Capitalists and bankers tend to hoard money during crises, rather than invest. As Marx put it: “during crises—<em>after</em> the moment of panic—during the standstill of industry, money is immobilized in the hands of bankers, billbrokers [speculators], etc.”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch06note57" id="ch06note57"><sup>57</sup></a> Just at the moment where it is most needed, credit dries up. Industrial and financial capitalists alike refuse to invest in production, which means less labor and less constant capital is employed, thereby spreading and intensifying the crisis.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_168"/>State governments, as we’ll discuss in the next chapter, may step in to make cheap credit available, but investors still won’t bite. There is no incentive to do so, as long as a glut of goods is making it impossible to sell at a profit. In the wake of the Great Recession, for instance, a worldwide overcapacity of steel led to more than 20 percent of steel factories and capacity sitting unused. There’s not enough demand for steel to motivate capitalists to invest in production, even if the factories and equipment are on the ready and cheap credit is made available to them.</p>
<div class="box3">
<p class="box-head">OVERPRODUCTION: THE CASE OF OIL</p>
<p class="noindent">Between 2004 and 2013, annual spending by the eighteen largest oil companies in the world quadrupled from $90 billion to $356 billion.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch06note58" id="ch06note58"><sup>58</sup></a> In the US, oil boomtowns sprang up seemingly overnight. The <em>Financial Times</em> reported that in North Dakota, “drilling rigs doubled from May to December 2009, from 35 to 75, and then doubled again to 173 by the end of 2010. The sleepy rural town of Williston, residents say, ‘went crazy.’”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch06note59" id="ch06note59"><sup>59</sup></a> The town’s population more than doubled:</p>
<p class="blocka">The roads were jammed with trucks and Ford pickups. You might have to wait in line for 90 minutes to get your hair cut at Walmart, or for two hours to get a table at one of the town’s handful of restaurants. Rents for single-bedroom homes were the highest in the country, according to a survey for <em>Apartment Guide</em> last year, at $2,394 per month; more than in the metropolitan areas of New York or San Francisco.</p>
<p class="block1">Businesses catering to the predominantly male oilfield workforce, including bars, strip clubs and tattoo parlors, did roaring trade. Boomtown Babes, a bright pink hut in a hotel car park, opened with women in vests selling “the Bakken’s breast coffee,” charging more than $7 for a large double-shot latte…</p>
<p class="block1">Williston’s infrastructure scrambled to keep up. There are new and half-built homes all around the city and plans for a $500m mall development, expansion of the water treatment system and a new airport.</p>
<p class="block1"><a id="page_169"/>“We’re playing SimCity in real life,” says Jeff Zarling of Dawa Solutions, a local web design and marketing firm. “We had to build everything.”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch06note60" id="ch06note60"><sup>60</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent1">Oil production shot up from an average of 5.4 million barrels per day in 2009, to 9.4 million six years later. At its peak, it sold for $107 per barrel. Yet by mid-2014, a glut of crude oil forced prices down by about 70 percent to below $30 a barrel. This glut was the result of increased supply due to the technological innovations involved in extracting shale oil, as well as depressed demand due to weak economic growth in much of the world.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch06note61" id="ch06note61"><sup>61</sup></a> “The price fall,” continued the <em>Times</em>, “has been like a bucket of cold water in the face for Williston and other oil boomtowns, waking them up from the frenzy of the past half-decade to a more sober reality.”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch06note62" id="ch06note62"><sup>62</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">The “market indicators” professed by bourgeois economists to keep supply even with demand and prices in check, completely failed. Two years after the drop in prices, oil production kept on churning. An optimistic analyst at the Swedish bank, SEB, told the <em>Financial Times</em> in March 2016, “there is a rebalancing on the way,” but, he admitted, “we are still running a surplus and stocks are building as far as we can see.”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch06note63" id="ch06note63"><sup>63</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">In part, production levels can’t quickly adjust down because high levels of technology and fixed capital necessary for production cannot be abandoned without the company and its investors taking a financial bath. Despite a drop in oil production, new projects in the Gulf of Mexico and Canada, for example, which were commissioned during the oil boom, just came online several years past the fall in prices.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch06note64" id="ch06note64"><sup>64</sup></a> And so the necessary pullback in supply simply cannot happen fast enough.</p>
<p class="indent">But there is another critical reason why supply keeps rushing forward. As we noted, competition forces capitalists to continue to fight for increased market share (or at least not give up their existing sales), for fear of abdicating greater share to their rivals. None of the oil-producing players want to be the first to fold. And this is even more exaggerated because oil is such a politically potent commodity.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_170"/>Major oil-producing countries in OPEC met in April 2016 to try to come to an agreement to “freeze” output to their current levels. This was a laughable goal to begin with, since current levels were already at record highs. In the end, they couldn’t even agree to this, because Iran—having slowed production while under sanctions—was only then catching up to <em>old</em> output levels and didn’t want to stop ramping up production. Saudi Arabia, for its part, would rather sell oil on the cheap than let its rival, Iran, regain market share. And so “OPEC members,” reported the <em>New York Times</em>, were “unable to agree on production cuts to manage the market. Instead, most members pumped oil at full capacity, trying to maximize revenues in the face of falling prices.”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch06note65" id="ch06note65"><sup>65</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">To be sure, some countries, like Saudi Arabia and Russia, can continue to pump out oil with little regard to how far prices drop, since their reserves are more easily accessible and only cost $3–5 per barrel to extract. In comparison to other oil-producing countries with more strained economies, they have some state resources to rely on to persist through the crisis and wait for others to fail. At the same time, in the United States, falling prices are much more quickly putting companies out of business. Here shale oil, despite the technological “advances” (fracking and horizontal drilling) used for its extraction, is still a lot more expensive to dig up. Even companies like Royal Dutch Shell, large enough to weather the storm, suffered major losses. Happily, for the rest of the planet, Shell altogether abandoned its exploration of the Arctic for drilling, despite a $7 billion, nine-year investment.</p>
<p class="indent">Of course, even this news is bittersweet, as capitalism always makes workers pay for hits to profitability. Thus the <em>New York Times</em> reported: ̶Earnings are down for companies that made record profits in recent years, leading them to decommission more than two-thirds of their rigs and sharply cut investment in exploration and production. Scores of companies have gone bankrupt and an estimated 250,000 oil workers have lost their jobs.”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch06note66" id="ch06note66"><sup>66</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_171"/>As prices crashed, the oil industry was left to reckon with a three-trillion-dollar mountain of debt following its borrowing binge during the boom. “The North American shale boom of the past decade,” explained the <em>Financial Times</em>, “was driven by real technological progress but also a rapid accumulation of debt. Now the boom has gone but the debt remains, and it will hang over the sector for many years to come.”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch06note67" id="ch06note67"><sup>67</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">Thus in early 2016, as oil prices bottomed out, Eagle Ford Shale was selling its trucks, trailers, and earthmovers at rock-bottom prices at a machinery auction in San Antonio. A flatbed truck for moving drilling rigs, usually worth about $400,000, was sold for $65,000. And mobile sand containers used for fracking, worth about $275,000 new were going for $17,000 a pop. Terry Dickerson, the Machinery Auctioneers founder, recounted to the <em>Financial Times</em> that many of the sellers were disappointed with the prices they got. “I feel like a funeral director. I’m the one that has to tell them the bad news.” This kind of “fire sale” in San Antonio, reports the <em>Times</em>, “is just a small part of the worldwide value destruction caused by the oil decline. From Calgary to Queensland, oil and gas businesses are scrambling to sell assets, often at greatly reduced prices, to pay back the debts incurred to buy them.”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch06note68" id="ch06note68"><sup>68</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">The nature of the boom and bust cycle is that the crisis in the oil industry does not remain forever. Rather it was in large part resolved on the backs of bankrupt companies, laid-off workers, and hollowed out boomtowns.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch06note69" id="ch06note69"><sup>69</sup></a> And those who have survived the bust figured out ways to boost productivity and cut costs in order to maintain profitability at a far-lower selling point per barrel. “When oil prices fell, the industry scrambled to adjust,” the <em>New York Times</em> reported. “It initially relied on tried-and-true tactics: cutting jobs and investment. But then companies realized they had to go further, starting a far-reaching reworking of their businesses to embrace new technologies and construction methods to stretch each dollar just a little more. The result has been drastically lower operating costs and higher cash flows. Learning to live in a weaker oil price environment gives them an upside if prices firm up.”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch06note70" id="ch06note70"><sup>70</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_172"/>Two years after the funeral-like machinery auctions in San Antonio, the <em>Financial Times</em> reported that once again at CERAWeek, the energy industry’s annual jamboree, the mood had “perked up enormously from the gloom of 2016 and last year’s tentative optimism. This year the smiles were broader and the drinks parties more crowded[sic]. Attendance was up 15–20 percent from last year. The improvement even extended to the quality of the food,” which participants described as “rich” and “exotic.” And yet, the article continued, “the general sense of relief is undercut by unease about the renewed boom in the US shale oil industry. Soaring US crude production raises the threat of renewed oversupply in world markets and another slump in prices.”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch06note71" id="ch06note71"><sup>71</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">And so, as Marx said, “we go ’round the whole circle once again.”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch06note72" id="ch06note72"><sup>72</sup></a></p>
</div>
<p class="h3">OVERACCUMULATION OF CAPITAL</p>
<p class="noindent">Finally, this brings us to a problem of <small>OVERACCUMULATION</small>. Too much supply of goods is one thing. This will eventually (if belatedly) be dealt with by reducing production to allow time for excess inventories to sell off. An additional and deeper problem arises as capitalists draw down production, leaving unused capacity in the form of factories, machinery, buildings, and other “fixed capital” (capital that is relatively <em>fixed</em> in place—land, buildings, large machinery). They cannot put all of their capital into motion, and this serves as a huge financial drain on their books. Thus as fixed capital remains unengaged and goods build up in warehouses, debt grows and prices continue to fall.</p>
<p class="indent">For this reason, crisis inevitably involves a large-scale liquidation of capital. Sometimes this means physical destruction—through wars, or wholesale dumping of goods—but also, as Marx pointed out, letting factories idle can also destroy capital:</p>
<p class="block">In so far as the reproduction process is checked and the labor-process is restricted or in some instances is completely stopped, <em>real</em> capital is destroyed. Machinery which is not used is not capital. Labor which is not exploited is equivalent to lost production. Raw material which lies unused is no capital. Buildings (also newly built machinery) which are either unused or remain unfinished, commodities which rot in warehouses—all this is destruction of capital. All this means that the process of reproduction is checked and that the <em>existing</em> means of production are not really used as means of production, are not put into operation. Thus their use-value and their exchange-value go to the devil.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch06note73" id="ch06note73"><sup>73</sup></a></p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page_173"/>Think of Detroit since its abandonment by the auto industry in the 1950s and 60s and you get an idea of what Marx means by destruction of capital. An unused factory is no longer capital. Only when labor is employed can a factory or machinery be engaged to produce value, and therefore amount to capital.</p>
<p class="indent">Of course, sometimes certain industries are allowed to limp along through state intervention, extending and exacerbating the overaccumulation of capital by not letting inefficient companies go bust. Consider the case of steel, which has experienced a colossal level of overcapacity for at least a decade since the Great Recession. Globally, the industry produces 35 percent more steel than can find effective demand. Yet production has not “adjusted” accordingly. The popular, politically opportunistic (and often laden with nationalist, racist rhetoric) explanation is to blame China. But it is capitalism’s own inherent tendencies (only most successful in China at present), which have led to this phenomenal global glut. A Duke University report, sponsored by American steel manufacturers and titled “Overcapacity in Steel: China’s Role in a Global Problem,” unwittingly makes this point. It’s worth quoting at length:</p>
<p class="blocka">In theory, overcapacity ought to be a short-term phenomenon. When demand and prices fall, profit-maximizing firms should reduce production and idle capacity. If the situation persists, firms will seek to permanently reduce capacity because the costs of maintaining capacity, notably maintaining furnaces and rolling facilities, decrease profits. Firms not maximizing profits will exit the market, while more efficient producers will capture market share, effectively eliminating excess capacity in the industry.</p>
<p class="block1">In practice, however, economic downturns cause overcapacity because capacity is price insensitive in the short-term; that is, the physical plant has limited, if any, ability to rapidly reduce its total capacity in response to changes in price. High exit barriers in the steel industry prevent rapid adjustments to capacity. The costs of reducing capacity include the dismantling and demolition of mills, environmental clean-up and remediation, and legacy pension or other labor-related costs. Expectations about increases in future demand and the cyclical nature of the industry also limit the incentives of steel producers to reduce plant capacity in the face of economic downturns. Many countries seek to preserve steelmaking capacity during economic downturns in order to mitigate increases in unemployment. Public subsidies or tax rebates are rationalized as preserving a strategic industry and reducing the effects of social problems caused by unemployment. Therefore, many steel producers find that the marginal cost of reducing capacity exceeds the marginal benefit, and prefer to continue production at lower levels to cover fixed costs, while either holding inventory or shipping the excess tonnage to spot markets where it is sold at lower prices. The result is overcapacity.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch06note74" id="ch06note74"><sup>74</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent1"><a id="page_174"/>An auto factory may be able to lay off workers and stop buying steel and rubber, thereby scaling back their costs. But they can’t simply take down entire standing factories and equipment and regain their costs. So, for instance, <em>Automotive News Europe</em> reported in 2013 that Europe’s 160 car plants were operating below 70 percent of their capacity. The other 30 percent is simply lost profitability.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch06note75" id="ch06note75"><sup>75</sup></a> While in the US, GM began plans to close five plants in 2018, while admitting that the four remaining plants still operate at less than half capacity.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch06note76" id="ch06note76"><sup>76</sup></a> Fewer goods are produced and less profit is made on the same base of previously invested capital. This is a recipe for an industry to limp along.</p>
<p class="h3">RESTORING PROFITABILITY</p>
<p class="noindent">Finally, the destruction of capital lays the basis for recovery. As weaker capitals go bust, those corporations that remained solvent through the crisis inherit a looser market, which has been abandoned by failing competitors. At the same time, falling prices during the recession have also devalued the means of production. The overproduction of machinery, software, and raw material has made them cheaper to buy. A weakened working class, meanwhile, will accept lower wages rather than risk joining the growing ranks of the unemployed. As Marx explained: “Stagnation in production makes part of the working class idle and hence places the employed workers in conditions where they have to accept a fall in wages, even beneath the average; an operation that has exactly the same effect for capital as if relative or absolute surplus value has been increased while wages remained at the average.”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch06note77" id="ch06note77"><sup>77</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">In addition to these “natural” devaluations in the cost of constant and variable capital, the remaining companies also benefit from the bankruptcies of other corporations. Those surviving capitalists can buy raw materials and machinery from bankrupted companies at bargain prices, thus further reducing the cost of constant capital. All this adds up to lower costs for inputs and therefore reduced costs of production. The capitalists that have managed to ride out the storm can make up for their losses and then some.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_175"/>In this way, crises are resolved through the competitive struggle. Overproduction gives way to the devaluation of capital, the destruction of productive capacity, and mass layoffs. A “restructuring” of the economy, as the talking heads dryly call it, involves mergers and acquisitions, buyouts, and the sale of assets at fire-sale prices. The process happens unevenly, with one capitalist gaining ground at the other’s expense. Economists Robert Wade and Frank Veneroso explained: “Financial crises have always caused transfers of ownership and power to those who keep their own assets intact and who are in a position to create credit… One recalls the statement attributed to [US robber baron] Andrew Mellon: ‘In a depression, assets return to their rightful owners’”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch06note78" id="ch06note78"><sup>78</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">Marx described it like this:</p>
<p class="block">How then is this conflict to be resolved? How are the relations corresponding to a “healthy” movement of capitalist production to be restored? … It involves this, that capital should lie idle, or even, in part, be destroyed … although this loss is by no means uniformly distributed amongst all the particular individual capitalists … the distribution being decided instead by a competitive struggle in which the loss is divided very unevenly and in very different forms according to the particular advantages or positions that have already been won, in such a way that one capital lies idle, another is destroyed, a third experiences only relative loss or simply a temporary devaluation, and so on.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch06note79" id="ch06note79"><sup>79</sup></a></p>
<p class="noindent">Now if remaining capitalists are to recover profitability in a context of falling prices, they are compelled to raise productivity and lower their cost of production. To do so they must invest in laborsaving technology. This then starts the process of accumulation up again, and brings us back to where we started at the beginning of the cycle as the economy begins to once again expand.</p>
<p class="indent">“And so,” wrote Marx, “we go round the whole circle once again. One part of the capital that was devalued by the cessation of its function now regains its old value. And apart from that, with expanded conditions of production, a wider market and increased productivity, the same cycle of errors is pursued once more.”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch06note80" id="ch06note80"><sup>80</sup></a> Depression will again give way to an expansion, which will inevitably culminate in overproduction, leading to a crisis, a depression, “and so on, until reaching,” as Maksakovsky put it, “capitalist ‘infinity.’”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch06note81" id="ch06note81"><sup>81</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">Marx’s analysis of the crisis of overproduction disproves the conventional wisdom that tells us that supply and demand exist more or less in equilibrium, and that the market knows best. More importantly, it shows that crises are not special or outside occurrences, arising from exceptional circumstances, but rather are just the most dramatic (and damaging) expressions of contradictions inherent to capitalism. These contradictions culminate in violent disruptions of working people’s lives. For capitalists, politicians, and economists, a crisis is a drop in profitability, but from a human perspective, it is the devastation wrought on families who lose their homes and workers who lose their jobs, and the vulnerability it creates among children, the elderly, and people with disabilities, robbed of their social safety nets.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_176"/>The Marxist understanding of the inevitability of crisis, and what’s more, its origins at the heart of the process of accumulation, make its regulation and reform akin to a Band-Aid on a gaping wound. Crises instead show the possibility and the necessity, certainly of class struggle, and ultimately of revolution. “Within the ruling class themselves, the foreboding is emerging that the present society is no solid crystal,” wrote Marx, “but an organism capable of change, and is constantly engaged in a process of change.”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch06note82" id="ch06note82"><sup>82</sup></a></p>
<p class="h3">A FALLING RATE OF PROFITABILITY</p>
<p class="noindent">We’ve seen that the very process of capital accumulation leads to crises, which play out in a boom-bust cycle. It also has a longer-term destabilizing effect on the system. The origin of these troubles is based on what Marx referred to as the <small>ORGANIC COMPOSITION OF CAPITAL</small>—the ratio in which capitalists invest in constant capital relative to variable capital. As we’ve discussed in previous chapters, constant capital is money invested in materials and equipment, and variable capital is invested in labor-power. Why is the ratio between these types of investment so important?</p>
<p class="indent">Marx observed that over time, the organic composition of capital rises, as fewer workers are required to wield more technology in production. So, for instance, in the preindustrial days of textile production, individuals spun and weaved in their homes utilizing a single loom. A single weaver to a single loom would imply a 1:1 ratio of machinery to labor-power.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch06note83" id="ch06note83"><sup>83</sup></a> The invention of the power loom in the early nineteenth century automated the process such that a child could operate six looms at once. Today a weaver is expected to run up to thirty looms simultaneously, and is trained to ensure that no machine should stop running for more than a minute. Each loom produces around three thousand meters a week.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch06note84" id="ch06note84"><sup>84</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">You can find similar trajectories in nearly every industry. Early print houses required journeyman printers who prepared ink and sheets of paper, compositors who set type for printing, and pressmen who each manually worked a press. Today, web-based printing orders are highly automated. One company boasted that a print run of hundreds of sheets requires as little as sixty seconds of labor.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch06note85" id="ch06note85"><sup>85</sup></a> Meanwhile, the most complex printers now print 3-D models, and do so much faster and with fewer employees than were needed to produce newspapers even a century ago.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch06note86" id="ch06note86"><sup>86</sup></a> Examples dominate every industry, from agriculture, to electronics, to fast food.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_177"/>This is because the capitalist class, in Marx’s words, “cannot exist without constantly revolutionizing the instruments of production.”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch06note87" id="ch06note87"><sup>87</sup></a> As we saw in the previous chapter, in order to stay competitive, every company must innovate, and this impulse propels technological vitality across industries. But the problem for capitalists is that no firm can privately hold on to their advances. Whichever company is first to pioneer new methods can undersell its competitors by producing goods more cheaply. But once the faster mode of production becomes the standard throughout the industry, then the average amount of <em>socially necessary labor-time</em> required to make the commodities drops, and prices fall accordingly to reflect this fact.</p>
<p class="indent">You can see how this plays out with computers. Huge, clunky, and much less powerful computers used to be more expensive because a lot more labor went into producing them. Now the technology that is used to make computers has vastly reduced production time. Your smartphone can do more than the old clunkers used to do, and for less cost.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch06note88" id="ch06note88"><sup>88</sup></a> The reduced necessary labor-time that goes into producing them is reflected in cheaper value and therefore cheaper prices.</p>
<p class="indent">Laborsaving technologies, by definition, squeeze out the number of workers employed relative to machinery. As we discussed in previous chapters, labor creates new value for capitalists, while investment in machinery and raw materials doesn’t. Constant capital simply embodies and passes on the existing value of previous generations of labor. Essentially, you can’t squeeze extra value out of a piece of machinery: you get what you pay for. So, when the organic composition of capital rises, the part of the investment that generates <em>new, added</em> value drops. The surplus value per unit of capital falls. This whole process leads to what Marx calls “the law of the <small>TENDENCY FOR THE RATE OF PROFIT TO FALL</small>.”</p>
<p class="indent">For the sake of numerical ease, let’s use a made-up company, BigBucks Printing, to follow the path of this process. BigBucks Printing runs three traditional lithographic presses, which each produce two thousand sheets an hour. Their twenty print press operators and technicians each earn $50,000 per year and split daytime and nighttime shifts such that they can run the presses 24/7. This allows BigBucks to maximize the time that the presses are running, and produce a total of 144,000 sheets a day. If the going rate was 10¢ per sheet, they would produce a daily value of $14,400 (or approximately $5.3 million per year).</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_178"/>BigBucks purchased each of their printers for $5 million. Anticipating a ten-year life for this equipment, every printer would then pass on $500,000 of value into the products per year, over the course of ten years. Myriad costs beyond labor and printers are associated with printing—ink, paper, rent, advertising, executive pay, research and development, just to name a few. In order to keep the numbers simple, we’ll lump these costs together, since they won’t impact the changes we are trying to understand.</p>
<p class="indent">Our very simplified annual budget might look something like this:</p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%">
<tr><td class="border1"><p class="tab-left">Labor-power (v)</p></td>
<td class="border1"><p class="tab-left"><em>20 workers x $50,000</em></p></td>

<td class="border1"><p class="tab-left"><strong>$4,000,000</strong></p></td></tr>
</table>
<p class="indent">BigBucks’ annual spending therefore comes out to $4 million. And the annual revenue we said is approximately $5.3 million. Once BigBucks pays back its expenses, this nets a profit of $1.3 million. Thus:</p>
<p class="bull_list">•<span class="space"/>Surplus value (s) = $1.3 million</p>
<p class="bull_list">•<span class="space"/>Constant capital (c) = $3 million</p>
<p class="bull_list">•<span class="space"/>Variable capital (v) = $1 million</p>
<p class="indent">In chapter four we defined the rate of surplus value, which measures the rate at which workers are exploited to produce surplus value. It is measured as s/v: surplus value to variable capital. In this case $1.3 million /$1 million equals a rate of surplus value of 130 percent. Yet the rate that capitalists are truly concerned about is the rate of profit, which is measured by the amount of surplus value, divided by the total investment: labor, machinery, and raw material. This formula is summed up as s/(v+c). In this case $1.3 million /$4 million equals a 33 percent rate of profit.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_179"/>But a few years after purchasing the three lithographic printers, a tight and shrinking market for print magazines puts a squeeze on BigBucks’ profits, sending their corporate managers to Miami for a lavish, soul-searching retreat, where they ultimately come to the conclusion that they must replace the old presses for the latest top-of-the-line digital printers.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch06note89" id="ch06note89"><sup>89</sup></a> They cost twice as much, $10 million a pop, but produce 30 percent more sheets per day. (If we assume again that the life of the new printers is ten years, each printer will pass on $1 million in value per year.) What’s more they require only half the labor-time to run them. So their new annual budget looks like this:</p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%">
<tr><td class="border1"><p class="tab-left">Labor-power (v)</p></td>
<td class="border1"><p class="tab-left">10 workers x $50,000</p></td>

<p class="indent">Ten pink slips later, they now produce 187,200 sheets a day (30 percent more than before). At the same going rate of 10¢ per sheet, they would produce a daily value of $18,720 (or approximately $6.8 million per year). Their annual net profit will be $1.8 million. The rate of surplus value therefore jumps to $1.8 million/$500,000, or 360 percent. And the rate of profit also rises to $1.8/$5 million: from 33 percent to about 36 percent. This good news sends BigBucks bigwigs back to Miami for some pool parties on yachts, floating cocktail bars, manicured fire pits, and gourmet s’mores. Profitability is up!</p>
<p class="indent">Assuming BigBucks was among the first to get the new top-of-the-line printers, there’s no reason that they would have to lower their prices. If most printing companies are using the old technology, the socially necessary labor-time for printing is set by the old, rather than the new, technology. But this positioning gives BigBucks some wiggle room in a competitive market. They <em>could</em> reduce their prices from the standard 10¢ per sheet, to 9¢ per sheet to grab more market share, and still make out with a wide profit margin of $1.1 million.</p>
<p class="indent">But following BigBucks’ success, it’s not long before other competitors decide to invest in their own advanced presses. And once BigBucks is no longer the single user of this technology, they lose the luxury of setting prices. In fact, other print presses will likely try to sell their products as cheaply as possible in order to regain their share of a shrinking market. Thus the standard socially necessary labor-time drops to the pace set by the new digital presses. Across the industry, companies are printing more in less time. Eventually, the fact that printers can produce 30 percent more goods using half of the labor-time is reflected in cheaper prices—say 8 cents per sheet.</p>
<p class="indent">At the end of this process the competitors are back on a level playing field. Workers across the industry are more productive—they can print more sheets per hour. But each company is left with having to make a much greater investment in constant capital than they had before, relative to the surplus value that their workers produce. The cost of production has increased, owing to the new, more expensive technology that is now the standard, and prices have dropped to reflect these productivity increases.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_180"/>How does this impact the rate of profit? Let’s go back to the last iteration of BigBucks’s budget. The cost of variable and constant capital remains $5 million. But at 8¢ per sheet, the 187,200 sheets a day produces a daily value of $14,976 (or approximately $5.5 million per year). Surplus value has therefore dropped down to about $500,000; the rate of surplus value is ($500,000/$500,000) or 100 percent; the rate of profit is ($500,000/$5 million) or 10 percent.</p>
<p class="fig_caption" id="fig8">FIGURE 8. BIGBUCKS PRINTING: STAGES OF PROFITABILITY</p>
<p class="image"><img alt="image" src="../images/img188-01.jpg"/></p>
<p class="indent">Of course BigBucks, and their competitors as well, will try to answer with speedups and salary cuts, but the overall trend is toward a slackening rate of profit.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_181"/>Marx summarized the process like this:</p>
<p class="block">[E]very new method of production of this kind makes commodities cheaper. At first, therefore, [the capitalist] can sell them above their price of production, perhaps above their value. He pockets the difference between their costs of production and the market price of the other commodities, which are produced at higher production costs. This is possible because the average socially necessary labor-time required to produce these latter commodities is greater than the labor-time required with the new method of production. His production procedure is ahead of the social average. But competition makes the new procedure universal and subjects it to the general law. A fall in the rate then ensues—first perhaps in this sphere of production, and subsequently equalized with the others—a fall that is completely independent of the capitalists’ will.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch06note90" id="ch06note90"><sup>90</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">In short: an ever-greater proportion of capitalists’ investments go to machinery and technology rather than increasing the size of the workforce. (The workforce may very well expand, but not at the same pace as the growth in machinery.) While individual companies may enjoy a short-term bump in profits, these benefits prove disastrous for the capitalist class as a whole. Once again, the short-term impetus of capital runs up against the long-term health of the system.</p>
<p class="indent">The process of accumulation therefore tends to <em>increase the rate of surplus value</em> through advances in productivity, but at the same time, it raises the organic composition of capital, and consequently <em>lowers the rate of profit</em>. As Marx wrote:</p>
<p class="block">The tendential fall in the rate of profit is linked with a tendential rise in the rate of surplus value, i.e. in the level of exploitation of labor… The profit rate does not fall because labor becomes less productive but rather because it becomes more productive. The rise in the rate of surplus value and the fall in the rate of profit are simply particular forms that express the growing productivity of labor in capitalist terms.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch06note91" id="ch06note91"><sup>91</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">These two tendencies—increases in the rate of exploitation and decreases in the rate of profit—go on together, but in such a way that the former does not keep up with the latter. Rising levels of capital investment (and with them the organic composition of capital) have no natural limits, while increasing the rate of exploitation most certainly does. No matter how much the bosses push, the working day cannot be “infinitely extended” past twenty-four hours. Nor can capitalists lower our wages to zero. Further, the more capitalism develops its productive forces, and the more machinery is employed in production relative to labor, the smaller the impact of rising exploitation, as the ratio of necessary to surplus labor take up a smaller piece of the overall capital investment. Surplus labor may rise “but in an ever smaller relation to development of the productive force.”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch06note92" id="ch06note92"><sup>92</sup></a></p>
<p class="h3"><a id="page_182"/>SYSTEM FAILURE</p>
<p class="noindent">Marx understood that this process occurs in the whole of the economy, not just in particular industries. Even in the most stubbornly labor-intensive industries, the <em>tendency</em> still exists to develop higher rates of productivity through the introduction of machinery, thereby increasing the organic composition of capital. Indeed, today almost every industry uses computers to coordinate its accounting, shipping, and supply chain.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch06note93" id="ch06note93"><sup>93</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">More importantly, declining profitability generalizes across the system because a mature capitalist economy develops an “average rate of profit” throughout the economy. In volume 3 of <em>Capital</em>, Marx explained that all industries—regardless of their individual organic composition of capital—have an average rate of profit. If this were not the case, capital-intensive industries with higher organic compositions would disappear, because no one would invest in businesses that yield lower profit margins. The equalization of a rate of profit across industries develops through the effects of supply and demand. Let’s pause here for a moment to see how this works.</p>
<p class="indent">If, for instance, the auto industry is generating rates of profit of 4 percent while the biotech industry is generating rates of profit of 8 percent, capitalists will want to invest less in auto and more in biotech. The ultimate result of this—less auto production and more biotech investment—will affect the profit rates in both industries in opposite directions. The increased supply of biotechnology will flood the market, forcing companies to reduce their prices in order to gain customers. In other words, increased supply will eventually drive down their prices, and therefore profitability. At the same time, drawing back the scale of auto production will decrease the supply of cars, eventually allowing for prices—and therefore profit rates—to rise.</p>
<p class="indent">In this way, increased competition and investment drive down the rate of profit in one industry while the other industry may “cool down” and its profits grow. Thus rising profit rates in low-profit industries and falling rates in high-profit ones leads to an equalization of the rate of profit for the economy as a whole as capitalists chase the best rate of return across the economy.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch06note94" id="ch06note94"><sup>94</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">With an average rate of profit in effect across the economy, the tendency of rate of profit to fall operates not only in those industries where the organic composition of capital rises precipitously, but in all industries.</p>
<p class="h3"><a id="page_183"/>COUNTERVAILING TENDENCIES</p>
<p class="noindent">This seems like a pretty big glitch in the matrix, and one could assume that capitalism ought to have ground to a halt long ago. Profits are, as we said, the lifeblood of capitalism. And if the rate of profit keeps dropping until it reaches zero, the system will undoubtedly shut down. As Marx put it:</p>
<p class="block">If we consider the enormous development in the productive powers of social labor over the last thirty [now 180!] years alone… and particularly if we consider the enormous mass of fixed capital involved in the overall process of social production… then instead of… the problem of explaining the fall in the profit rate, we have the opposite problem of explaining why this fall is not greater or faster. Counteracting influences must be at work, checking and cancelling the effect of the general law and giving it simply the character of a tendency, which is why we have described the fall in the general rate of profit as a tendential fall.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch06note95" id="ch06note95"><sup>95</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">There are two main reasons why the tendency of falling profitability has not already dealt a deathblow to the system. One reason is that while the <em>rate</em> of profits may drop, so long as it stays above zero percent, the <em>mass</em> of profits does not necessarily have to fall. A declining rate of profit can (and often does) occur alongside a rise in the mass of profits. Tracking the rate of profit tells us the amount of profits reaped relative to investment in labor and technology. If capitalists are able to grow the <em>mass</em> of products and therefore the <em>mass</em> of profits, they can compensate for this drop and keep cash flowing.</p>
<p class="indent">Nevertheless, were the rate of profit to continually fall, eventually hitting zero, capitalists would not gain from their investments. M-C-M’ would become M-C-M, a waste of time. But this brings us to the second point, which is that the drop in the rate of profits is a <em>tendency</em> and not a <em>certainty</em>. Marx argued that capitalism was plagued by the “law of the tendency for the rate of profit to fall” rather than “law of the rate of profit to fall.” This phrase may be linguistically clunky, but it’s more accurate nonetheless.</p>
<p class="indent">Writing in <em>Capital</em>, volume 3, he explained: “The same causes that bring about a fall in the general rate of profit provoke countereffects that inhibit this fall, delay it, and in part, even paralyze it. These do not annul the law, but they weaken its effect. If this were not the case, it would not be the fall in the general rate of profit that is incomprehensible, but rather the relative slowness of this fall. The law operates therefore simply as a tendency, whose effect is decisive only under certain particular circumstances and over long periods.”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch06note96" id="ch06note96"><sup>96</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_184"/>What are these countereffects? First, capitalists can make up for a drop in profitability through good old-fashioned exploitation. Never willing to let their profits slide, capitalists always respond to diminished returns by increasing exploitation. Thus we see the many variations of attacks on the working class, which raise the rate of surplus value through means other than laborsaving technology. Teachers in New York City are asked to work a longer day without compensation. Children are employed in sweatshops in Los Angeles at superexploited wages. Immigrants in Chicago are picked up at parking lots and work all day for well below a minimum wage. Union wages in Wisconsin are shattered through right-to-work laws that break the power of unions. Workers at an Austin-based computer factory are sped up, their every move timed to the second. And so, for these reasons, the “rationalization” of work pioneered by Frederick Taylor, which we discussed in chapter four, has become the standard of how labor-power is organized.</p>
<p class="indent">Where corporations are unable to increase the rate of exploitation by intensifying the labor process, they can also move overseas, or to right-to-work states, to find cheaper labor, and thus postpone the need to invest in technology. Historically, capitalism has known no human bounds in its quest to offset falling profit rates. Slavery, concentration camps, and European colonies have all been used to prop up profitability.</p>
<p class="indent">A second countervailing tendency has to do with the value of constant capital itself. While businesses make ever-greater investments in machinery and raw materials, the price of each of these technologies may decline over time through, as we discussed in chapter four, their <small>MORAL DEPRECIATION</small>. That is, the machines become less valuable before their value <em>physically</em> deteriorates when they are superseded by faster machines. Increases in productivity in industries that manufacture the means of production lead to decreasing values of these inputs as well. So, for instance, while printing companies need to buy more advanced presses, the value of these presses will drop, as new technology decreases the amount of labor-time necessary for their manufacture. (If BigBucks Printing spent $10 million per printer in 2015, by 2020 these same printers may cost their competitor RetroPrint only $8 million a pop.)<a href="19_bm006.html#ch06note97" id="ch06note97"><sup>97</sup></a> The rate that the value of technology drops may not always keep up with the rate at which new technology needs to be procured (for instance, if you need twice as many printers, but the price of printers doesn’t drop in half). But overall, the rate at which investment in constant capital rises is at least stunted by this countervailing tendency.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_185"/>Other factors, as well, can neutralize or lessen the tendency for the rate of profit to fall. An expansion of markets through colonialism and the globalization of trade, for instance, can increase the rate of sales and create a higher <small>TURNOVER RATE OF CAPITAL</small>. The turnover rate measures the time that elapses between the investment of capital toward the production process, and when the produced goods are sold. The faster the speed at which invested capital becomes realized, the more rounds of production can happen within a given span of time, and the more profit can be made.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch06note98" id="ch06note98"><sup>98</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">The strength of these countervailing tendencies ensures that falling profitability is a <em>tendency</em> rather than an absolute law. Instead of plummeting towards a 0 percent rate of return, the downward pressure on profits manifests itself over a long period of time and not in a linear trajectory. So long as there is the prospect of a positive rate of profit, capitalists will invest, and capital will remain in circulation.</p>
<p class="h3">A REAL DRAG</p>
<p class="noindent">For these reasons, rather than producing regular economic crises, the tendency for the rate of profit to fall creates a long-term drag on capitalism.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch06note99" id="ch06note99"><sup>99</sup></a> Both the downward pressures on profits, and the desperate attempts to counteract it, work to destabilize the system. First, workers are disposed of and replaced by more machinery, creating higher unemployment—or “surplus population”—as Marx called it.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch06note100" id="ch06note100"><sup>100</sup></a> Those workers who remain on the job are forced to work harder and harder as bosses drive up the rate of exploitation. As the mass of profits grow, class relations become increasingly polarized.</p>
<p class="indent">Second, a fall in the rate of profit brings about a competitive struggle among capitalists to drive out the least efficient and the smallest capitalists. Larger companies can use economies of scale, monopoly positions, and access to cheap credit to ride out the crisis and beat out lesser companies. The weeding out of smaller capitalists drives the system toward greater concentration and centralization. Marx explained:</p>
<p class="block"><a id="page_186"/>Concentration grows at the same time [as the profit rate falls], since beyond certain limits a large capital with a lower rate of profit accumulates more quickly than a small capital with a higher rate of profit… The mass of small fragmented capitals are thereby forced onto adventurous paths: speculation, credit swindles, share swindles, crises. The so-called plethora of that capital is always basically reducible to a plethora of that capital for which the fall in the profit rate is not outweighed by its mass… <a href="19_bm006.html#ch06note101" id="ch06note101"><sup>101</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">Third, as the quote from Marx hints at, dropping profitability in industrial production encourages speculation in nonproductive, financial products, which we will discuss further in the next chapter. As the 2007 to 2008 economic meltdown showed, the casino of finance capital can lead to dramatic explosions. Finally, capitalists are compelled to invest in production in countries where the rate of profit is higher, while simultaneously expanding markets across the globe. These economic imperatives are backed by the barrel of a gun. Aggressive economic globalization spills into imperialist missions, threatening the stability of global capital.</p>
<p class="indent">The significance and effect of the tendency for the rate of profit to fall, and its role within a broader theory of crisis, is the topic of long-standing and deep debates among Marxists. But at a minimum, it’s clear that any falls in the rate of profit make the system more prone to crises. As Simon Clarke argued, Marx did not identify the tendency for the rate of profit to fall as a “privileged cause for crises,” but it nevertheless “plays the role of a factor which makes crises more likely, primarily because it leads to an intensification of the competitive struggle between capitalists.”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch06note102" id="ch06note102"><sup>102</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">Marx certainly attached great importance to the tendency for the rate of profit to fall. It points to a fundamental contradiction at the heart of capitalism: the drive toward maximizing profitability is undermined <em>by its own process</em> of accumulation. Marx explained that the rate of profit “is the spur to capitalist production,” and thus:</p>
<p class="block">[A] fall in this rate slows down the formation of new, independent capitals and thus appears as a threat to the development of the capitalist production process; it promotes overproduction, speculation and crises, and leads to the existence of excess capital alongside a surplus population. Thus economists like Ricardo, who take the capitalist mode of production as an absolute, feel here that this mode of production creates a barrier for itself and seeks the source of this barrier not in production but rather in nature (in the theory of rent). The important thing in their horror at the falling rate of profit is the feeling that the capitalist mode of production comes up against a barrier to the development of the productive forces which has nothing to do with production of wealth as such; but this characteristic barrier in fact testifies to the restrictiveness and the solely historical and transitory character of the capitalist mode of production; it bears witness that this is not an absolute mode of production for the production of wealth but actually comes into conflict at a certain stage with the latter’s further development.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch06note103" id="ch06note103"><sup>103</sup></a></p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page_187"/>In short: “The <em>true barrier</em> of capitalist production, is <em>capital itself</em>.”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch06note104" id="ch06note104"><sup>104</sup></a></p>
<p class="h3">CONCLUSION</p>
<p class="noindent">The highly contested role of the tendency for the rate of profit to fall in part owes itself to the fact that Marx did not outline a systematic theory of crisis in any one place. Instead, pieces of the theory exist scattered in notes and in a few chapters of <em>Capital</em>, volumes 1 and 3, and in <em>Theories of Surplus Value</em> (sometimes referred to as volume 4 of <em>Capital</em>.) Of those writings, only volume 1 of <em>Capital</em> was written and completed by Marx himself, during his lifetime. For this reason (as well as the complexity of the issues), Marxists have differed in which aspects of Marx’s writing—falling profitability, overproduction (or in some cases, underproduction), disproportionality among branches, the role of credit—are emphasized, and how these pieces fit together.<a href="19_bm006.html#ch06note105" id="ch06note105"><sup>105</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">Yet whatever the cause of each particular crisis, all express the contradiction between the limitless development of the forces of production and the subordination of that production to the realization of surplus value. But crisis is not only the product of these contradictions; it is also—for capital—the solution. The devaluation and destruction of capital can wipe out excess capacity, and also restore falling profit rates through the cheapening of the means of production. This “solution” violently restores profitability on the backs of working people. And what’s more, it is always temporary. Thus capitalism jolts back and forth through booms and busts. It is characterized, in the words of Ernest Mandel, by a “rhythm of development—<em>uneven, unsteady</em>, proceeding by leaps which are followed by periods of stagnation and retreat.”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch06note106" id="ch06note106"><sup>106</sup></a></p>
<p class="indent">Nevertheless, whatever the scale and fury of economic crises, none automatically translate to revolution or the end of capitalism. As Russian revolutionary Leon Trotsky put it, “There is no crisis which can be, by itself, fatal to capitalism.”<a href="19_bm006.html#ch06note107" id="ch06note107"><sup>107</sup></a> Rather, crises create objective conditions, which make struggle, and ultimately the overthrow of capitalism, <em>possible</em>. But this depends on the subjective element—the confidence, organization, and politics of the working class. These are topics that lay outside the scope of this book, but the final word will be left here to Trotsky, who went on to explain:</p>
<p class="block"><a id="page_188"/>The oscillations of the business cycle only create a situation in which it will be easier, or more difficult, for the proletariat to overthrow capitalism. The transition from a bourgeois society to a socialist society presupposes the activity of living men who are the makers of their own history… The crises of capitalism are not numbered, nor is it indicated in advance which one of these will be the “last.” But our entire epoch and, above all, the present crisis imperiously command the proletariat: “Seize power!” If, however, the party of the working class, in spite of favorable conditions, reveals itself incapable of leading the proletariat to the seizure of power, the life of society will continue necessarily upon capitalist foundations—until a new crisis, a new war, perhaps until the complete disintegration of European civilization.</p>
