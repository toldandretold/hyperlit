At that time I had a friend who had been a detective in his younger days. He was the late E.C. (Chas) Hopkins, who had been an original member of the homicide squad at the time. During discussions we held about some of the serious crimes committed when he was in the squad, he drew my attention to the affair, and I learnt from him that the investigating police had been strongly, and in his view wrongly, accused of fabricating a confession and of assaulting Stuart. He also outlined the huge controversy which followed."

Inglis, then a young lecturer in history at the University of Adelaide, and [\u2018]The Stuart Affair \u2019, whose author was Sir Roderic Chamberlain, who had been the prosecutor at the trial, and who represented the Crown at subsequent hearings. His book was essentially a rebuttal of many of Inglis\u2019s claims, which included the casting of doubt on the trial jury\u2019s verdict of guilty."

She had gone to the beach with her brother Peter and another boy during the afternoon, but the boys returned home for a time and when they came back later she was not to be seen. When she had not returned home by tea time, her father went to the beach to look for her, but could not see her. Then after searching in other places without success, he notified the local police. The three officers stationed at Ceduna (Sergeant H. L. Walker, and Constables H. Herde and L. Green) and a considerable number of local citizens conducted a search. It was nearly midnight before her body was discovered in a small cave in a low cliff."

There was a show on Friday Night and I slept in the show tent at Ceduna. At about 7.30 a.m. on Saturday, 20th. December, 1958, I awoke and started work at the show. I had a drink of tea first but nothing to eat. I worked at the Show until 10 o\u2019clock and then I left. The show was situated at the Ceduna Oval. Me and Allan walked down to the Jetty. Then we were talking to one half caste bloke. He\u2019s the bloke who lives around the beach but I don\u2019t know his name. We walked down the beach near the Jetty and into a little cave. The three of us sat down and drank a flagon of wine. The three of us came up to the town here. Allan went back to the Show Ground. It was then about half past eleven I think. I got a flagon of wine off a white fellow I met near the Ceduna pub. He was drunk. I gave him eight shillings to get it. I went down to the same place. I stopped there by myself and drank the flagon. No, I only drank half of it. I put the other half flagon in a sugar bag. I came into town carrying the bag. I left the bag with the flagon in it down by the Picture show wall. I jumped in a taxi. Went down to the Thevenard pub. I got off there. I was sitting down outside the pub. I think I must have stopped there about an hour I think. Then I seen a fellow with a bottle of wine. He offered me a drink. He had a little bit. I said to him, \u201cI think I will buy this off you.\u201d He said, \u201cYou can have it for nothing.\u201d I got it off him. Then I started walking back. It was one o\u2019clock I think. Just after coming out of Thevenard town I stood and I finished that bottle. I walked back to the pub again. Could not see that bloke. Then I came back. I walked down to the beach. Then I saw this little girl. I was pretty full then. She was standing in a pool of water playing. I said to the little girl, \u201cThere is some little birds over there.\u201d I pointed up towards the cave. She said, \u201cI will go and have a look\u201d She walked in the cave. No I am wrong I crawled in the cave first and she crawled after me. She said, \u201cWhere\u2019s the birds?\u201d I said, \u201cThey are gone now.\u201d I punched her on the side of the head. She went unconscious. I took her bathers off. Then I raped her. She was hard to root. I done her. Then I hit her with a stone. Before I raped her I took my clothes off. I was wearing a shirt and pants. I also took my boots off. I think I hit her six times with a stone. I left her. I think she was dead. I went and had a wash in the sea. I had no clothes on. I went back to near the cave where I had taken my clothes off and put them on. I started to walk back along the beach towards Ceduna town. I got on the road from the beach near the Church. I went around the back streets to where the caravan park is. Got a flagon of wine. That was the one I left in the bag. I drank that. I then went back to the Show. I worked around there for about two hours. About sundown me and another fellow went down to the Jetty. We were looking for other fellows drinking. Then we saw two blokes sitting down drinking. When we went down there they put the bottle away. I had more wine 9 that night with them. On Sunday morning 21.12 1958 (sic) I got the sack from the Show. A friend of mine \u201cHerbie\u201d helped me to get a job with the Wheat Board. I started work there on Monday, 22nd. December, 1958, at 8 a.m. I slept at the Wheat Board with another native in a tent. We went to bed at about 7 o\u2019clock tonight and I went to sleep and after a while I got up to go to the lavatory. When I went back I seen a car standing in front of the tent and you blokes then spoke to me and took me to the Police Station. I killed her because I did not want her to tell what I had done. I cannot read English. I have heard this statement read to me and it is true and correct in every detail."

Peter\u2019s father, a fisherman, [\u2018]stated that he had landed on the beach at about a quarter to four, but had not seen the girl.\u2019[^1] Thus there was an indication that the crime had been committed some time after lunch and before about 4 p.m. However, Dr. Thompson, who gave evidence about the child\u2019s injuries, considered that the probable time of death was between 2.30 p.m. and 9.30 p.m.[^2] Nevertheless, the balance of evidence was that the time of Mary\u2019s disappearance was between lunchtime and about 4 p.m."

They knew much more about the case than those who formed their opinions on the basis of what was published in newspapers such as the *News.* They also knew the local police well, and probably had no doubt about their probity. People who were familiar with what had transpired during the court hearings knew that the police had been accused of using threats and violence to obtain the conviction, that they had been accused of perjury, and that it had been implied that the confession was a fabrication. Some would probably have known, and the jury certainly did, that the police had given evidence that there were scratches on Stuart\u2019s knees and back which he could not explain, and that there was the evidence of the trackers.

It seems that the main reason for the trip was to get a drink, but that he also intended to look for a girl."

However, contradictions in the evidence of witnesses are not uncommon. They can be due to lapses of memory, and some witnesses simply become confused and give wrong answers inadvertently. It is also well-known that some people have much better memories than others. Sometimes a witness gives a wrong answer, and after being told that the answer is wrong and what the truth is, the memory returns: the witness may then retract, and sometimes even explain why the memory failed. There are other factors: positive evidence that something happened is often more reliable than evidence that it did not - in any particular situation, some people see or hear things that others do not. Corroboration of the evidence of one witness by another is a very important factor. It is also well-known that the evidence of a child or adolescent is more likely to be unreliable than that of a mature adult. A number of witnesses at the Royal Commission were young."

[\u2018]In 1935 Napier was appointed chairman of a royal commission to inquire into the nation\u2019s monetary and banking systems.\u2019 He was [\u2018]an inspirational chairman\u2019, and his fellow commissioners, including J.

In this he was right: most South Australians adhered to a strict code of conduct, and were intolerant of crime and sexual promiscuity. There was a very low crime rate, marriages were stable, and caring for children was a top priority. Generally speaking, there was acceptance of and commitment to the social norms of the age. This prevented the harm which comes to societies where there is not such conformity. It is all too obvious in today\u2019s society that the many current prevalent social ills reflect the abandonment of conformity to the social mores of yesteryear. Such conformity now seems to be regarded as having been oppressive, but South Australians generally appreciated the benefits of living in a state relatively free from crime, and from other social ills which they knew from experience needed to be held at bay."

For example, in Melbourne there are the State Library, Supreme Court, G.P.O., Melbourne Town Hall, Royal Exhibition Building, Old Treasury Building, Parliament House, and the Queen Victoria Market. There are similar examples in the other states. The main difference was that the public buildings in Adelaide were concentrated in Victoria Square and along North Terrace. This was part of the continuing planned development of Adelaide, and accorded with the vision of Col. William Light, the colony\u2019s first Surveyor-General. As in the other colonies, the city buildings reflected the confidence of a thriving society, and the power and wealth of the state\u2019s leading citizens. Similarly, the planting of English trees and flowers in Adelaide seems not to have been much different from what happened in other states. It took a long time for settlers from Europe to abandon their preference for European flora in favour of the Australian ones."

The democratic system of government meant that he could be challenged and criticised, and could not be a dictator any more than any other government leader in the country. If Inglis is to be believed, then Playford and the members of his government should not have been able to speak their minds or take action which they were entitled to under the law.

Per head of population, South Australia had attracted more migrants than any other state, and these people welcomed the opportunities on offer. The so-called baby boomers had even greater opportunities than their parents, and the children of immigrant parents were particularly fortunate. The chance for upward social mobility was made possible, among other factors, because of the remarkable expansion of the public school system and the dedication and professionalism of teachers."

The Playford Government dealt with the situations which arose quite properly, and took full responsibility for its decisions. In terms of political popularity, some of these decisions were to cost it dearly. However, the only questioners who suffered from the [\u2018]full weight of Establishment power\u2019 or [\u2018]economic or social pressure\u2019 seem to have been Rivett and the directors of the *News*. There is no evidence whatsoever that the decision of two of Stuart\u2019s counsel to move interstate was due to any pressure from the Government, the Courts, or the police.

What is true is that the Government, members of the legal profession, including the judges directly involved, and many members of the public were critical of the *News* for its reporting of the case. The Government was clearly outraged. Nevertheless, the critics were justified in claiming that the Government overreacted in pressing for the charges of seditious libel, if not those of criminal libel, and in hindsight it can be seen that the charges should have been only for libel."

From what Chamberlain wrote about his conversation with Playford regarding the commutation of the death sentence, it appears that there had been no disagreement.[^14] Likewise it is simply not credible that Playford responded angrily: [\u2018]The law is that Max Stuart will not hang.\u2019 Playford well knew what the law was, and believed that it should apply in Stuart\u2019s case, which is why he had been reluctant to commute the sentence."
