<p>On 10 April 1989 members of the fascist organisation, National Action, invaded a meeting of the Lesbian and Gay Immigration Task Force in Sydney. Twelve men stormed into the meeting wearing masks and balaclavas and dressed in black. They took photographs of task force members. They also seized documents including an invitation to the group’s 5th anniversary dinner. The fascists chanted anti-gay slogans and carried placards saying “AIDS is a solution not a disease,” They were forced out of the meeting after about two minutes by furious task force members.</p>
<p>Members of the Lesbian and Gay Immigration Task Force said that the raid was an intimidation exercise but that it had not worked. The group had been aware of the possibility of such an invasion as they recognise themselves as prime targets for the anti-homosexual and anti-Asian politics of fascist organisations. One of the co-convenors of the Task Force told the Sydney Star Observer that security at task force meetings would be tightened up but that the raid would in no way deter the very successful work of the Task Force.</p>
<p>According to the <em>Sydney Morning Herald</em> of April 17 1989, the police arrested one man, 24 year old Wayne David Smith, for allegedly participating in the raid. Smith is a member of National Action and after he was arrested, National Action’s Chairman, Jim Saleam, visited the police station to give Smith support and to bail him out.</p>
<p>There is an alarming rise in fascist violence taking place in Sydney. The Anti-Discrimination Board, the Uniting Church and the Aboriginal Community are all targets along with lesbians and gay men. Cars with stickers supporting Aboriginal rights have been firebombed outside Tranby Aboriginal College.</p>
<p>Meanwhile in Melbourne fascist thugs from National Action attempted to attack a feminist march protesting ANZAC day. The only thing between us and National Action was a row of police and we certainly cannot rely on <strong><em>them</em></strong> to defend us! Left paper sellers have been attacked by National Action when selling their papers in the Bourke street mall and earlier this year Melbourne experienced the horror of a Vietnamese student being murdered on the steps of Flinders Street Station. This murder was committed by fascists.</p>
<p>On the weekend of the 15th and 16th of April 1989 there was a spate of fascist graffiti directed at particular targets. The synagogue in St Kilda was daubed with swastikas. Racist slogans appeared on the walls of the Community Aid Abroad office accused the organisation of, among other things, “supporting black terrorists” because of their work in support of Namibian independence. The Communist Party of Australia got the words “kill red scum” sprayed across the front of their Collingwood headquarters along with symbols of the South African Afrikaner fascist organisation AWB. Two Nazi skinheads were caught after spraying up the Synagogue but there have been no reports in the newspapers about the incident since.</p>
<p>In 1988 British Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher visited Australia for the so-called Bicentenary. In Melbourne we gave Thatcher the welcome she deserves: a mass demonstration protesting her policies both at home and abroad. Opposition to the anti-gay Clause 28 was one of the things that brought many people to the demo. However a small group of demonstrators had placards characterising Thatcher as a fascist. She <em>is</em> an ultra conservative right wing politician but she <em>is not</em> a fascist.</p>
<p><strong>What is Fascism?</strong></p>
<p>Fascist, as a term, is used very loosely often as a political swear word against right-wing figures or reactionaries. (The word was originally taken from the Italian word <em>“fascio”</em> , meaning “bundle” or “sheaf,” a reference to the symbol of power carried by the ancient Roman consuls). The current meaning of the word fascism did not apply before the rise of Mussolini’s fascist government in the early 1920s.</p>
<p>When leftists are asked to define fascism terms such as dictatorship, mass neurosis and anti-Semitism are bandied around but do not give us a clear or correct definition.</p>
<p>But there is a Marxist analysis of fascism. It was made by Leon Trotsky during the rise of fascism and it was one of his greatest contribution to Marxism. Trotsky began by analysing what happened in Italy with Mussolini’s 1922 triumph. He then wrote extensively on the question throughout the 1920s and 30s. Trotsky made a point by point critique of those political parties which failed to realise ‘the mortal danger of fascism’. He worked hard to try to alert the Comintern (Communist International) and the German Communist Party about the danger of fascism and attempted to rally a united front to defeat Nazism.</p>
<p>In the pamphlet <em>Fascism: What Is It and How To Fight It?</em> Trotsky describes a political cycle, of which fascism is the final link:</p>
<p><em>“Both theoretical analysis as well as the rich historical experience of the last quarter of a century have demonstrated with equal force that fascism is each time the final link of a specific political cycle composed of the following: the grave crisis of capitalist society; the growth of radicalisation of the working class; the growth of sympathy toward the working class and a yearning for change on the part of the rural and urban petty bourgeoisie; its cowardly and treacherous manoeuvres aimed at avoiding revolutionary climax; the exhaustion of the proletariat; growing confusion and indifference; the aggravation of the social crisis; the despair of the petty bourgeoisie, its yearning for change; the collective neurosis of the petty bourgeoisie, it readiness to believe in miracles, its readiness for violent measures, the growth of hostility towards the proletariat which has deceived its expectations. These are the premises for a swift formation of a fascist party and its victory.”</em></p>
<p>The time when fascism can arise is when bourgeois democracy – with its police, army and parliament – can no longer keep society in a state of equilibrium. When society can no longer be held in a state of equilibrium the petty bourgeoisie really gets squeezed in the middle. Trotsky describes what can result when</p>
<p><em>“through the fascist agency, capitalism sets in motion the masses of the crazed petty bourgeoisie and the bands of declassed and demoralised lumpenproletariat — all the countless human beings who finance capital itself has brought to desperation and frenzy.”</em></p>
<p>So fascism finds its recruits in the middle class. When capitalism is in crisis the petty bourgeoisie are largely dissatisfied as a class, and through propaganda their indignation and despair is diverted away from blaming capitalist big business, to blaming the working class. The result is a desperate and frenzied petty bourgeoisie being used as a battering ram against the working class.</p>
<p>Fascism is a measure to which the bourgeoisie resorts to save capitalism by smashing the organised working class when the system is in crisis. Through fascism the bourgeoisie can do a thorough job of reorganising capital. Trotsky wrote in 1934: <em>“the historic function of fascism is to smash the working class, destroy its organisations, and stifle political liberties when the capitalists find themselves unable to govern and dominate with the help of democratic machinery.”</em></p>
<p>Fascist regimes never tame the ruling class, which remains autonomous to pursue its economic goals. Fascism exists with the <em>support</em> of the bourgeoisie, which sees fascism as necessary measure for the advancement of its own financial interests. <strong>Fascism and big business are linked</strong>. When big business withdraws its support it is the beginning of the end for fascism as no political regime can govern against the class which holds economic power.</p>
<p>While fascism is the product of failing capitalism it is also the result of failing to achieve socialism. In a time a social crisis and economic dislocation if the working class does not give a strong lead to the petty bourgeoisie then the ruling class will. And when hope is lost the petty bourgeoisie will go for “strong” measures such as fascism.</p>
<p><strong>How to fight fascism</strong></p>
<p>Trotsky calls for a united front as a way to fight against fascism.</p>
<p>In <em>Socialist Feminism: the First Decade,</em> Gloria Martin gives a good description of what is meant by the term. She says: <em>“A united front is a conglomerate of workers’ organisations ‘marching separately and striking jointly’ in a combined thrust against capitalist reaction. No contingent is expected to change or sacrifice its basic principles and program and each sector of the front is free to raise proposals and debate strategy for the entire movement so long as everyone strikes together. The united front is closed to no one, but leadership must be retained by the working class organisations or the ‘liberal’ bourgeoisie will seize power and defuse the movement, rendering its development into a revolutionary brigade impossible and ensuring the defeat of the workers by the ruling class. We do not engage in ‘popular’ or ‘people’s’ fronts, a Stalinist form of criminally irresponsible revisionism which ‘unites’ all classes under the hegemony of the liberal governmental forces who always proceed to compromise with the ruling class. So the key elements of a united front are both program and leadership in the interests of the working class.”</em></p>
<p>Liberals and reformists of every stripe will urge us to ignore the fascists and not give them any attention at all. They bleat that the fascists are just seeking attention and that to protest will just give them more opportunity to promote their ideas. They propose solutions such as monitoring the actions of the fascists or lobbying the police. Trotsky answers this brilliantly when he says:</p>
<p><em>“fascism finds unconscious helpers in all those who say that the ‘physical struggle’ is impermissible or hopeless, and demand of the Doumergue (Premier of France after Feb 6 1934) the disarmament of his fascist guard. Nothing is so dangerous for the proletariat, especially in the present situation, as the sugared poison of false hopes. Nothing increases the insolence of the fascists so much as “flabby pacifism” on the part of the workers’ organisations. Nothing so destroys the confidence of the middle classes in the working class as temporising, passivity and the absence of the will to struggle.”</em></p>
<p>Beware the pacifists who argue for inaction. We must confront the fascists toe to toe when ever they dare to show their face. Fascism must never be allowed to go unchallenged. Pacifism will just allow the germ of fascism to grow unchecked.</p>
<p>As well as forming united fronts to fight against fascism we also need to be prepared to form workers defence guards to defend working class newspapers, meetings and organisations from fascist attack. When a working class organisation is under the threat of fascist attack all class conscious organisations must be prepared to join the defence through a workers’ defence guard. A couple of examples spring instantly to mind.</p>
<p>In Melbourne National Action were harassing left wing paper sellers from both the Socialist Workers Party and the International Socialists (IS) in the Bourke Street Mall. A broad section of the Melbourne left pledged to form workers’ defence guards to ensure that any working class organisation could sell their paper without fascist interference. National Action backed off (strongly encouraged by a little physical persuasion by the IS!) and the left in Melbourne continues to distribute literature safely. In 1985 a number of meetings were held in both Melbourne and Sydney to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the liberation of Saigon. Some of these meetings were attacked by Australian and Vietnamese fascists. A meeting at the Sydney Waterside Workers’ Federation offices was delayed but went ahead with a fully equipped defence guard. Needless to say, the fascists didn’t show up.</p>
<p><strong>US United Fronts to Fight Fascism</strong></p>
<p>Late last year the United Front Against Fascism (UFAF) formed in the Pacific North West of the United States just days before a Nazi skinhead gathering planned for Whidbey Island. The Nazi skinheads were gathering to commemorate the death of a notorious fascist, Robert Mathews, who had been killed on Whidbey Island in a shoot out with the FBI.</p>
<p>The UFAF brought together socialists, feminists, unionists, gay men, lesbians and people of colour to protest. The call for the UFAF was initiated by the Freedom Socialist Party and many groups quickly responded to the call including Seattle Gay News, the National Association for the Advancement of Coloured People, the Guardian Angels, the Stonewall Committee for Lesbian and Gay Rights, Radical Women and the Association of People Living with AIDS.</p>
<p>Despite shrieking calls by the media for the UFAF not to confront the fascists because confronting them “would cause violence,” in a breathless four days the UFAF mobilised 400 brave people to directly challenge the Nazis. Lesbians and gay men were out in force.</p>
<p>The UFAF was democratic to the core and elected three spokespersons and decision makers to give a lead to the demonstration. They were revolutionary socialist feminist, Guerry Hoddersen, George Bakan, crusading editor of the influential Seattle Gay News and long time black leader and journalist for Seattle’s Facts newspaper, Charlie James.</p>
<p>George Bakan delivered the strong opening statement at the rally to the effect that the people of the Northwest cannot turn their back on the fascist threat and hope it will go away. “We are here to fight the Nazis. There will be no Aryan Nation,” he proclaimed.</p>
<p>The rally was a huge success. As the four hundred demonstrators paraded, the small number of Nazi skinheads made themselves very scarce.</p>
<p>Then in early March the Nazis were at it again and once again they were trounced by anti-fascist demonstrators.</p>
<p>The Bay Area branch of the Freedom Socialist Party put out a call to form the Ad Hoc Coalition to Stop the Nazi Skinheads when they heard of plans to hold an “Aryan Woodstock” at Napa, 45 miles north of San Francisco. The Ad Hoc Coalition mobilised 800 people from both the city and the rural communities surrounding Napa around the slogan “No to racist violence! Stop the anti- labour, sexist, anti-gay, anti-Semitic neo-fascists!”</p>
<p>Aryan Woodstock was organised by an outfit calling themselves WAR (White Aryan Resistance), founded by Tom Metzger, former Ku Klux Klan Grand Dragon. WAR had expected 2,000 to attended their fascist rock festival but in the end only about 50 Nazi skinheads turned out and because of the counter demonstration only those with personal invitations were allowed in.</p>
<p>There was a large contingent of lesbians and gay men involved in the counter- demonstration. Many were from ACT-UP San Francisco and wearing <em>Silence = Death</em> T Shirts, a slogan as appropriate for fighting fascists as it is for fighting AIDS. The lesbian and gay contingent chanted “No to Hatred, No to Fear, No to Nazis, Yes to Queers!”</p>
<p>“These people are about hatred, violence and murder”, said to Arawn Eiblhyn, one of the ACT-UP contingent. “They are a different threat to our own right to live and survive as lesbians and gay men, as Jews, as blacks…They do not have a right to organise against our right to live and survive.”</p>
<p>We need to learn from both of these successful examples of united fronts. We must remember that Hitler’s movement started small. We can stop the fascist menace because at present the anti-fascists are many and the Nazis are few. What we need is unity and the will to ensure that the fascists cannot organise and grow.</p>
<p>Whenever fascism appears we must mobilise. We must counter its organising with swift strong united front actions to drive them off the streets. We must defend all working class and progressive events from fascist attack through forming workers defence guards.</p>
<p>But, as Trotsky pointed out, the germ of fascism is nurtured by capitalism and a capitalist crisis can raise fascism to epidemic proportions unless drastic countermeasures are quickly applied. The way to ultimately destroy fascism once and for all is to destroy the capitalist system in which it breeds. In the constant struggle between competing forces we must ensure that germ of fascism is extinguished permanently through the triumph of socialist feminism.</p>

<h1>Capitalism’s Fascist Virus Needs Working Class Antidote</h1>
<h2>ALISON THORNE | Issue: 9 | WINTER/SPRING 1993</h2>
<p><a href="https://socialism.com/fsb-article/capitalisms-fascist-virus-needs-working-class-antidote/">source</a></p>
<p>That capitalism is in bad shape is not news. What is news is the sharpened polarisation of class forces, which has the decaying system as its source.</p>
<p>Attacks by fascist groupings are on the rise. Anti-Semitic slogans, such as ones recently daubed on a synagogue in Brisbane and another in Perth, follow a global trend.</p>
<p>Dozens of Jewish-owned shops in Italy were subjected to racist graffiti the day after a mass fascist mobilisation, which attempted to recreate Mussolini’s 1922 March in Rome. In Germany, Jewish monuments at the former Sachsenhausen and Ravensbruck concentration camps have been targets of resurgent neo-Nazi assault.</p>
<p>People with disabilities have also been under attack. A residential institution in east Germany was firebombed, and four deaf boys were mugged by fascist activists in Halle.</p>
<p>The British National Party has escalated its hate campaigns and physical attacks on Black working class communities.</p>
<p>The fascist movement of Jean Marie Le Pen in France increased its vote at the last election. This new boldness by open fascists helps create the climate in which several racist killings of North African teenagers could occur.</p>
<p>In South Africa, the rightwing AWB fire bombed a gay restaurant in Johannesburg after running a vicious campaign against the venue for months.</p>
<p>Romani (Gypsies) are the community under attack by fascists in Hungary.</p>
<p>Since German reunification, 34 people have been killed in fascist attacks. The victims include immigrants, refugees, the homeless and prominent anti-fascist campaigners. Kerstin Winter, a 24-year-old lesbian rights activist and anti- Nazi organiser, was tragically murdered by fascists who sent her a splinter bomb in a parcel.</p>
<p>But the news isn’t all bad. This resurgence of fascist attacks is being met by an increasingly combative and well-organised anti-fascist movement. In the United States and Canada, successful united front mobilisations have got the Nazis on the run. (see Linda Averill, “Winning West Coast Strategy: Knock out the Nazis with a United Front,” <em>Freedom Socialist,</em> Volume 14 #2, April – June 1993).</p>
<p>Mass anti-fascist mobilisations occurred in France and in Italy, where 30,000 took to the streets in protest. Over 2 million participated in anti-fascists actions in Germany, which are increasingly mobilising and uniting trade unionists, immigrants and refugees.</p>
<p><strong>And on the home front.</strong> The proposed visit to Australia by Nazi agitator David Irving provoked a storm of media controversy. Irving was invited to tour Australia by the League of Rights, whose founder Eric Butler, like Irving, claims the Holocaust never happened. The ultra-right League of Rights claims that its mission is to capture the minds of middle Australia.</p>
<p>The government took the step of denying Irving a visa. However the real target of this ban was revealed by Senator Gareth Evans, who explained that this step was necessary to prevent mass public protest, which such a visit would provoke. Evans considered this as undesirable “in the leadup to the federal election.”</p>
<p>Top-down attempts to ban fascist organising are totally ineffectual and will not stop the spread of fascist ideas. Such bans also set precedents, which governments will not hesitate to use against the Left when it suits them.</p>
<p>The government banned Irving’s visit to Australia, but now the League of Rights is promoting the sale and screening of an Irving video in an attempt to popularise his Nazi propaganda, which not very convincingly masquerades as history. Successful demonstrations against the video, called at very short notice, managed to prevent screening in most capital cities. This is an example of how we can <strong><em>start</em></strong> to build a mass movement to stop fascism.</p>
<p>Anti-fascist organisers in Melbourne built on the success of the anti-Irving protest, leading to larger demonstrations against a conference organised by the Citizens Electoral Council, Australian followers of U.S. fascist Lyndon LaRouche.</p>
<p>LaRouche, who began his political life as a member of the U.S. Socialist Workers Party in the 1940s, lost his political bearings and jumped the fence from Trotskyism to fascism because of his terminal sexism and inability to cope with the exploding second wave feminism in the ‘60s (for full analysis of this phenomenon, see Clara Fraser, “LaRouche: Sex Maniac and Demagogue” in <em>Freedom Socialist</em> , Volume 9 #3, 1986).</p>
<p>The leader of the Australian LaRouchites, who follows his ideological guru faithfully, distinguished himself when he recently condemned feminism as a psychosis!</p>
<p>Several hundred turned out to protest the LaRoucheite gathering after a week- and-a-half of organising. The lesbian and gay press ran articles exposing the politics of LaRouche, the Victorian Trades Hall Council passed a resolution condemning the conference, ACT-UP held a public meeting. Radical Women’s meeting included an educational on LaRouche and his origins, and anti-LaRouche organisers gave dozens of radio interviews. Posters were pasted up, leaflets distributed and meetings held on campuses.</p>
<p>Predictably liberals, including Adam Carr, news editor of <em>Melbourne Star Observer</em> , bleat about the “necessity” of free speech for fascists.</p>
<p>Those who raise this familiar refrain as an excuse to do nothing about the growth of fascism have totally missed the plot by letting fascists organise openly and without protest.</p>
<p>When anti-fascists mobilise, we are simply exercising <strong><em>our</em></strong> free speech rights to demonstrate. Our aim is to build a movement powerful enough to stop fascism before it grows.</p>
<p><strong>Competing ideology.</strong> The potential is present to build a mass fascist movement when the economy starts to crumble. The petty bourgeoisie, or middle class — small business owners, farmers, self-employed professionals and so on — provide the mass base for fascism as it is squeezed by big capital. Big capital uses the desperation this generates to turn the anger of the middle class away from the real culprit, capitalism. Instead, the petty bourgeoisie blames the working class for the desperate circumstances it experiences.</p>
<p>As the big bourgeoisie runs out of options to inject new life into its decrepit economic system, fascism will start to look increasingly appealing to the middle class.</p>
<p>Fascism is capitalism’s final solution to the problems of the 1990s. Socialism is <strong><em>our</em></strong> solution, and we must convince the petty bourgeoisie of its correctness.</p>
<p>It is a competition between ideas, a fight for the future. If the vision and leadership provided by socialists is not sufficiently bold, some working people will be attracted to fascism as they search for answers to their misery and despair.</p>
<p>We cannot be derailed from the struggle against fascism by the liberals who preach “free speech” in a vacuum.</p>
<p>Nor can we rely on forces of the State — like the police and immigration authorities — to stop the right wing.</p>
<p>The working class — women and men, queer and straight, people of all ethnic backgrounds — has the clout to stop fascism in its tracks.</p>
<p>We’ll do this by fighting to implement <strong><em>our</em></strong> vision — a socialist solution to the economic ruin, which feeds fascism.</p>

<h1>Queer Youth Conference Resists Homophobia And Fascism</h1>
<h2>SABINA NOWAK | Issue: 18 | SUMMER/AUTUMN 1998</h2>
<p><a href="https://socialism.com/fsb-article/queer-youth-conference-resists-homophobia-and-fascism/">source</a></p>
<p>My participation in the 13th Annual International Gay and Lesbian Youth Organisation (IGLYO) Conference in Pisa, Italy [27 July – 3 August 1997] was a unique experience. It was the first time any delegate from Australia had been accepted to attend an IGLYO conference, and the first time a representative from any bisexual organisation in the world took part.</p>
<p>The theme of the conference was: Homophobia and Fascism. Ironically, as I sat in Frankfurt airport waiting for a connecting plane, I got chatting with a German man for whom fascism was currently a major issue. He was on his way to Colombia to live with his wife and new baby. He told me that as he was a white man and his wife was a woman of colour; his family would not be safe from Neo-Nazis if they stayed in Germany. This made the purpose of the conference that much more real for me, and made me feel very lucky that the Neo-Nazi movement in Australia is as yet insignificant.</p>
<p><strong>Concentration camps and their consequences.</strong> The first discussion at the conference focused largely on the experiences of homosexually active men under the Nazi regime in 1930s and ‘40s. Sex between men had been made a crime before Hitler came to power, but after his accession, the anti-gay sex law was more harshly policed. In the concentration camps, gay men were multiply discriminated against by the officers. Also, many of their fellow prisoners did not associate with them. Because support played a vital role in survival, this increased their peril.</p>
<p>Homosexuality remained illegal in Germany until 1969. Homophobic discrimination later prevented the stories of homosexuals in the camps being told and recognised until the last 15 years or so, and there is still relatively little evidence available about what actually happened. Gay men lived with the fear of being put back in jail, because imprisonment in the camps could be used as evidence against them if they had not completed their “sentences.” They also faced increased sentences for any new charges if they had been concentration camp inmates.</p>
<p><strong>Organising against discrimination today.</strong> After the plenaries on fascism in Nazi Germany, conference delegates attended a series of sessions to discuss the effects of homophobia, sexism and fascism in our own countries.</p>
<p>Holland was very close to legalising same-sex marriages until the Chinese government (which adopts out a lot of children who have been relinquished due to the one child policy) said that they would not let Holland have any Chinese children if same-sex couples were allowed to be married, and thus received full child adoption privileges.</p>
<p>Gays in the military is still a major issue for many European countries, particularly where there is compulsory military service for men – such as in Bulgaria, Estonia and Italy. A man from Bulgaria had to undergo a series of psychological tests. When the doctor discovered his same-sex preferences, the man was told that he would require another test after a year to see if he had “improved.” If he is “cured,” he will have to take part in military service; if not, he will have his “deviancy” marked on his permanent record.</p>
<p>I presented a session on Australia. I spoke about the history of gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender and HIV positive people’s achievements and current struggles, and described the move to the right in Australian politics.</p>
<p>Many delegates displayed exciting material about campaigns from their own countries. I saw photos from Belgian gay, lesbian and bisexual youth camps, posters produced by the “North London Line,” media coverage of the Pride March in Buenos Aires and a video of gay night life in the former Yugoslavia.</p>
<p>The whole conference spent a day in Florence, where we saw the new community centre, run by the Florence gay and lesbian organisation. Representatives told us they received no funding for the centre. They survived by opening up as a café and bar on Friday and Saturday nights. This, they said was the legacy of living in the land of the Pope.</p>
<p><strong>Lessons for Australia.</strong> Australia has a lot to learn from IGLYO. IGLYO is influential in Europe and has representatives on the international youth board alongside conservative and religious youth organisations. This board plays an important role in shaping European Union youth policy. Similarly, Australians and non-heterosexual youth from countries outside Europe have a lot to offer IGLYO to make it more international.</p>
<p>IGLYO has an international pen pal program for gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender youth under 27 years old. It is a great way to get to know queers from all around the world! To join, write to <strong>IGLYO</strong> PO Box 542, 1000 AM Amsterdam, The Netherlands, or e-mail to <a href="mailto:IGLYO@pi.net">IGLYO@pi.net</a>. Send a copy of your passport or driver’s licence, some info about yourself, the languages you speak and your address.</p>
<p>I appreciate the opportunity to attend and learn about gay, lesbian and bisexual life in other countries. The next IGLYO conference takes place in Amsterdam in 1998 to coincide with the Gay Games. It would be terrific for other gay, lesbian and bi youth to have the opportunity to attend by having an Australian lesbian/gay/bisexual contingent.</p>

<h1>International Anti-Fascist Conference: A Lost Opportunity to Build Solidarity</h1>
<h2>LUMA NICHOL | Issue: 18 | SUMMER/AUTUMN 1998</h2>
<p><a href="https://socialism.com/fsb-article/international-anti-fascist-conference-a-lost-opportunity-to-build-solidarity/">source</a></p>
<p>In the ‘80s and early ‘90s, the shocking resurgence of fascism in Europe was marked by jackbooted racist skinheads, marches of uniformed “seig-heiling” Hitlerites and the torching of Turkish refugee residences. Now the fascists are forming parties like Austria’s Freedom Party, Italy’s National Alliance and Belgium’s Vlaams Blok and are heading for the ballot box.</p>
<p>This shift in strategy promoted Britain’s Anti-Fascist Action (AFA) to call an International Militant Anti-Fascist Conference in London from October 2 to 5. The stated goal of the conference was to form an international network of militants to counter the fascists and oppose the doomed liberal approach of ignoring or caving in to the far right. Unfortunately, the anti-communism sweeping Europe has disoriented some anti-fascist groups. The opportunity to discuss ways of building a powerful international anti-fascist movement was lost.</p>
<p><strong>Fascism in Europe today.</strong> The revival of fascism around the world is sparked by capitalist economic crisis. Preserving profits in the era of inflation and stock market crashes demands lowering the living standards of the working class. Fascism is big business’ brutal trump card. Le Pen and his ilk are used by the ruling class to brutalize and terrorize working people. It is no coincidence that members of Italy’s National Alliance were first given government posts as part of billionaire Berlusconi’s coalition in 1994. Today, they have the backing of 15% of the electorate.</p>
<p>The ultimate goal of fascism is to crush the workers’ movement and to eradicate all democratic rights. For this the fascists need a mass movement. Entering European elections has given them an ostensible legitimacy and following that Nazi marches and skinhead brutality cannot produce. Yet to mobilize their base of support – the middle class – they need an issue that taps into the deep insecurity and anger of this constituency. In the current period, that issue is: immigration.</p>
<p>With the highest unemployment rate since the Nazi era and 20 million migrants in Europe, xenophobia is running rampant. Fuelled by the rhetoric of the extreme right, vicious attacks on the people of color and refugees have skyrocketed, even in countries like Scotland and Denmark. The extreme right sees immigrant bashing as its ticket to power.</p>
<p>In response to the new fascist populism, mainstream parties have jumped on the racist bandwagon to enact a plethora of anti-immigration legislation.</p>
<p><strong>The fall of the USSR: a boost for the far right.</strong> The crumbling of the Eastern Bloc had a profound effect on Europe. Despite its betrayals of the world working class, the Soviet Union acted as a check on rampaging capitalism. With the fall of the USSR came economic and political chaos. In the former Eastern Bloc countries, fascist gangs resurfaced. In Western Europe, demoralization and disorientation set in as Stalinism was discredited, severely weakening Communist Parties such as the French CP, which had commanded 28% of the electorate. So-called progressives like Britain’s Labour Party leader Tony Blair took a hard right turn.</p>
<p>In this post Cold War confusion, the fascists raised the flag of nationalism and began to win elections. In France, Jean-Marie Le Pen’s National Front now governs four municipalities in the South. Fascist officials in these cities have launched a cultural war against progressive ideas. Their reactionary activities include banning books from public libraries, closing counter- culture cafés catering to progressive youth and cancelling funding from a movies series about AIDS.</p>
<p>The extreme right electoral advance and the treacherous liberal response demand a strong answer from anti-fascist forces.</p>
<p><strong>Dangerous disorientation in the anti-fascist movement.</strong> The disorientation among some anti-fascist groups is alarming. AFA and similar group blame the resurgence of fascism on the failures of the “old Left,” rather than on capitalism. AFA refuses to work with the Left and accuses it of “caving in” to fascists. It ignores the success of groups like France’s Ras l’Front, a Trotskyist-led united front, which staged an anti-National Front protest that drew 70,000, instead resorting to virulent red-baiting as a substitute for political debate. This is an extremely dangerous course, which is dividing and weakening the movement.</p>
<p>Coupled with AFA’s sectarianism is sexism: both prevent the group from building vital alliances with communities directly targeted by violence. Tellingly, the conference did not seek out representation from the Jewish, immigrant, feminist, labor, lesbian/gay, or Romani (Gypsy) movements. Yet these are the very groups that will provide the leadership of an effective groundswell of protest.</p>
<p>Of all places in the world, it is in Europe that activists must know where this kind of sectarianism leads. AFA’s policies parallel the disastrous stance of the Communist Party of Germany (CPG) in the ‘30s. The leadership of the CPG also blamed the “old Left” – in their case, the leaders of the Social Democratic Party – for the rise of Nazism. Their refusal to organize a united front between Communists and Social Democrats led directly to Hitler’s seizure of power and all that followed.</p>
<p>To counter a far-right mass mobilization, anti-fascists must build a broad movement that educates about the fascist threat and its roots in the decaying economic structure. Luckily, many of the other conference participants, who represented groups from Western Europe, Canada and the U.S., are working along these lines.</p>
<p>Young feminist, gay rights anarchists in Scandinavia have built a powerful network that allies itself with the Left and others to successfully close Nazi bookstores and counter the ultra-right. In Germany, the numerous groups are linked in three networks. They work with Turkish Communists, the Autonome youth movement, students, bikers, and many others to stage protests, publish newsletters, and sponsor coffee houses in order to mobilize opposition.</p>
<p><strong>The fight is just beginning.</strong> As militants, conference participants were clear that non-confrontation of the “fash” is dangerous and that reliance on bourgeois governments to halt Nazism is deadly. But AFA’s sectarianism derailed real debate. It would have been valuable, for example, to strategise with international activists around issues such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>How to promote the participation of trade unions as the backbone of the movement, <em> How to respond to the massive number of cruel hate crimes, since laws and the police can’t and won’t address the problem, </em> How to prevent the media and ultra-cautious liberals from isolating and marginalizing activists as “extremists” or “alarmists.”</li>
</ul>
<p>Despite its failure, the conference demonstrated that the battle to stop fascism is on. This fight is galvanizing young people, anti-racists and workers the world over. The winning strategy depends on the ability to forge solidarity. To succeed, fascism must conquer the working class completely. It <em>must</em> not be permitted to do this and it <em>will</em> not.</p>
<p>An international campaign by trade unionists, civil rights activists, leaders of many different oppressed social sectors and ordinary people of every description is what’s needed. Allied to protect our rights and livelihood and to uplift the human condition, such a united front can demoralize, demobilize and destroy the peddlers of degradation and tyranny!</p>

<h1>Tenacity Pays Off: Nazi headquarters shut down!</h1>
<h2>PETER MURRAY | Issue: 19 | WINTER/SPRING 1998</h2>
<p><a href="https://socialism.com/fsb-article/tenacity-pays-off-nazi-headquarters-shut-down/">source</a></p>
<p>In April this year, after a 15-month battle, Campaign Against the Nazis (CAN) celebrated the closure of a Nazi organising centre in Melbourne’s northern suburbs.</p>
<p>National Action (NA) is a Nazi outfit which occasionally emerges from the sewers of Australian politics. In January 1997, NA opened what it called a “bookshop” on Fawkner, a multicultural community with a large Italian and Arabic component. Anti-Asian posters, in Italian and English, began appearing at train stations and shopping centres. People of Asian appearance were threatened, and young Muslim women intimidated as they walked to school. The news spread quickly. A united front of left organisations and community activists formed to organise against the fascist outbreak.</p>
<p>CAN has been in recess since an earlier successful battle against National Action. Previously known as Brunswick Against the Nazis, it had been instrumental in rallying the community of Brunswick against an NA rally in 1994. The tiny gathering of 30 skinheads and other thugs was shouted down and literally run out of town, despite a police cordon. Many believed that the 1994 victory could be repeated, and a demonstration outside the Nazi bunker was planned for March.</p>
<p><strong>Outside the bunker.</strong></p>
<p>As a demonstration, the March action — a tightly disciplined gathering attended by well over 1,000 people — was a success. The Fawkner community saw there was broad and committed opposition to the Nazis, and NA was put on notice that it had a fight on its hands. But the “bookstore” remained. Clearly it was necessary to devise a longer-term strategy to close down NA’s would-be Melbourne headquarters. There were two reasons for the initial failure to shut down NA’s shopfront. First, there was a huge police presence, involving mounted cops, the Protective Security and Intelligence Group, and the Special Operations Group. The aggressive police protection of the fascists made any direct action to evict the handful of NA goons impossible. Later rallies also faced massive police intimidation.</p>
<p>Second, there was no real political agreement in CAN about the purpose of the rally. In previous confrontations with NA, the fascists arrived at a meeting place, attempted to rally — usually unsuccessfully — and then scuttled away. This time, because they had a well-defended base, it was clearly necessary to build an ongoing anti-fascist campaign.</p>
<p>The Freedom Socialist Party (FSP) argued that CAN should focus on outreach in order to build the broadest mobilisation, uniting all of the potential targets of fascism. Other participants believed that it was possible to simply march into the shop and close it down. This ignored the balance of forces. Those holding this position elevate the tactical question of how to close the place to the level of a principle: that there is only <em>one</em> way to do it. This abstract, formalistic thinking has characterised much of the debate about CAN’s tactics.</p>
<p><strong>CAN in the firing line.</strong></p>
<p>Some participants in the united front became demoralised by the lack of an agreed strategy, and this led directly to a decline in participation at CAN meetings. Meanwhile, other obstacles were being thrown up.</p>
<p>Most Moreland Councillors argued that if ignored, NA would simply go away. This dangerous position also had an impact on the campaign: demonstrations in Fawkner became harder to organise. Disoriented by the difficulties, the International Socialist Organisation (ISO) began to retreat from mass mobilisation. It wanted CAN to persuade the Moreland Council to ban National Action. The CAN majority rejected this, believing that it is up to the community to organise itself against fascism. The ISO succeeded in lobbying the council to ban “divisive” groups from council property. This led to a couple of zealous bureaucrats targeting CAN itself as divisive!</p>
<p>The Spartacist League (SL) blamed CAN for the initial inability to shut the shop. At the March 1997 rally, its contingent launched a macho charge against the police barricades, which achieved nothing except injured marshals and the arrest of some young anarchists. The SL wanted “mass mobilisation to drive the Nazis out,” but never lifted a finger to achieved that aim. This is unsurprising. In all the years it has been around, the SL has made a policy of never taking responsibility for building a struggle. That way, others can be blamed when battle does not result in immediate, total victory.</p>
<p>Inside CAN, a lot of unnecessary time was wasted on recriminations and endless organisational minutiae. Political disagreements were tiptoed around, and, despite organising more rallies in Fawkner, CAN stagnated for some months — again due to lack of political focus. Despite this, CAN’s organising was exposing NA as Nazis. This meant the fascists made no progress in recruiting amongst Fawkner’s unemployed. NA posters were regularly removed or pasted over. In what was called the “paper war,” CAN was clearly winning. Its many endorsers donated free or cheap printing. This solidarity allowed CAN to negate National Action’s propaganda.</p>
<p><strong>Crowding out NA.</strong> After some months, CAN has coalesced into a solid core of activists, with a strategy of cutting off NA’s political air supply. Twenty thousand copies of a broadsheet exposing NA as fascist were distributed. Every home and business in Fawkner was letterboxed. CAN activists came face to face with a goon at the NA bunker. Without police protection he was not very brave, and ran away! CAN’s rallies and meetings had shown who really owned the streets. In fact, some of Fawkner’s young people took to hanging out near the shop in order to harass the Nazis!</p>
<p>With NA more or less contained, CAN was able to build broader alliances through organising Rock Against Racism fundraisers, forums and participation in actions against far-right One Nation parliamentarian, Pauline Hanson. In January this year, an important Survival Day concert was organised jointly with the Aborigines Advancement League and the Mirimbiak Nations Aboriginal Corporation. The last demonstration against the Fawkner bookshop was held on March 15, one year after the first rally. A few weeks after that NA fled the state — again!</p>
<p><strong>How to fight fascism.</strong></p>
<p>It was ironic that, on the eve of NA’s departure, one of CAN’s endorsing organisations, Workers Power (WP), put out a leaflet criticising CAN for what it believed was an incorrect strategy. Once again, CAN was blamed for the fact that the Nazis still had a toehold in Fawkner. CAN was not militant enough, WP alleged, and this lack of militancy was the reason why rallies had become smaller. WP also claimed that CAN had become complacent, resigned to the fact that NA would remain for an indefinite period.</p>
<p>Unless militancy is defined as a willingness to get one’s head repeatedly kicked, it is simply wrong to argue that CAN is not a militant organisation. Standing up to NA is not a pacifist action. In the face of heavy police intimidation, demonstrating outside NA’s headquarters, time and again, is not complacency. Distributing leaflets under the fascists’ noses is an act of political defiance — a refusal to allow Nazis to get away with intimidation.</p>
<p>It is unfortunate that the comrades from Workers Power, who had been active participants in CAN, succumbed to demoralisation or frustration, or both, and reverted to an empty formalism in their call for “no platforming” National Action.</p>
<p>Leon Trotsky, a leader of the Russian Revolution, once remarked that the best way of dealing with fascists is to acquaint their heads with the pavement. A worthy sentiment indeed! However he never argued that it is the <em>only</em> solution. There are many possible tactics in the struggle against fascism, of which mass mobilisation to chase them off the streets is the most immediately effective.</p>
<p>For a number of reasons — including an undoubted complacency of many left organisations and trade union leaders — CAN was not able to organise a force sufficiently overwhelming to neutralise the police and destroy NA’s headquarters. Does this then mean that fascists should remain unchallenged? Once again, Workers Power takes a tactic and elevates it to a principle.</p>
<p>In contrast, the Democratic Socialist Party (DSP), which played a leadership role in CAN for over a year, simply stopped participating. Then, when CAN celebrated the news that National Action had shut up shop, the DSP responded in <em>Green Left Weekly</em> with a polemic against CAN’s tactics which failed to acknowledge that, until recently, the DSP had been part of the organisation which devised the strategy!</p>
<p>CAN had to work out a strategy and tactics to contain NA, while arguing for mass action. It was not flawless. Mistakes were made. Despite sustained efforts to broaden CAN, the united front failed to attract the ongoing active participation of non-Anglo community groups. There is still tension between members of the united front about the way forward. But the question has to be asked: where in politics were lessons learned except through engagement in the struggle and except through the correction of mistakes?</p>
<p><strong>Tenacity, tenacity, tenacity.</strong></p>
<p>This was another of Trotsky’s phrases. It certainly applies to the small group of activists who carried through to a successful conclusion the campaign against NA’s now-abandoned headquarters. It is a motto for the Freedom Socialist Party and Radical Women, which is why both organisations have been committed to the CAN united front since NA began attempts to organise in Melbourne.</p>
<p>When the ISO and Socialist Alternative moved to close down CAN is May, we opposed it vigorously, because CAN still has immediate work to do. In Bell Street, Coburg is the headquarters of another fascist organisation, the so- called Citizens Electoral Council (CEC). The führer of this well-funded organisation is the US-based Lyndon LaRouche, a notorious fascist. CEC is currently fighting with another fascist outfit, the League of Rights, for control of Pauline Hanson’s One Nation Party.</p>
<p>NA itself has splintered over the question of whether or not to merge with One Nation, but this does not diminish the threat of fascist thugs on the streets. There is the need to counter One Nation itself, which, although not yet a fascist mass party, may soon develop into one. Its rhetoric towards Indigenous people and Asian immigrants in nearly identical with the German Nazi Party’s 1930s stance towards Jews and Romani (Gypsy) people.</p>
<p>CAN still has much to do in the trade union movement and the community. It is necessary to build sustainable alliances, educate about the nature of fascism and win increased support for fighting Nazis through mass mobilisation. This must be CAN’s priority.</p>
<p>Ultimately, there is only one antidote to Nazism: a socialist revolution. However, as capitalism lurches into an ever-deepening crisis, the struggle against fascism — its ideological essence — becomes a daily necessity. Each victory, such as that at Tyson St, Fawkner, makes that struggle easier.</p>

<h1>The high price of ignoring teenage fascists</h1>
<h2>GUERRY HODDERSEN | Issue: 21 | WINTER/SPRING 1999</h2>
<p><a href="https://socialism.com/fsb-article/dateline-u-s-a-the-high-price-of-ignoring-teenage-fascists/">source</a></p>
<p>On the 110th anniversary of Hitler’s birthday, twelve Littleton, Colorado high-school students and one teacher died in a hail of automatic gunfire and shrapnel from homemade bombs. Their executioners were their classmates and neighbours, Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris.</p>
<p>Within hours of the shooting, the national media descended on Littleton, a suburb of Denver, and attempted to answer the question: how did this tragedy happen? An evolving portrait of the killers emerged on TV and in newspapers over the next two weeks.</p>
<p>At first, they were described as intelligent, hardworking, relatively law- abiding computer nerds. Soon a more sinister picture emerged.</p>
<p>The boys were “misfits,” leaders of a Trenchcoat Mafia that listened to German rock music and hated jocks and people of colour. They wore clothes with Nazi insignia. They made death threats to other students. Klebold kept a diary filled with racist, anti-Semitic and Nazi references.</p>
<p>And they singled out Isaiah Shoels, an African American athlete, and shot him in the face during their murderous rampage at the school. They also picked out Kyle Velasquez for execution.</p>
<p>TV commentators urged the public to listen to their children and to learn how to recognise the warning signs of psychiatric illnesses in teenagers. President Clinton and the organisation Ceasefire renewed their calls for gun control. Preachers exhorted parents to “take responsibility” for their families. School administrators considered outlawing trenchcoats.</p>
<p>Lost in the rush for quick fixes is the realisation that the teenaged killers in Littleton, Colorado had a <strong><em>political illness</em></strong> , not a psychiatric one. They were adolescent fascists, set on the path to destruction by a well-funded international <strong><em>adult</em></strong> movement.</p>
<p><strong>Nazis target alienated youth for recruitment.</strong> The rampage by the teenaged killers in Littleton was not the first of its kind.</p>
<p>In 1980, a youth named Gundolf Kohler walked into an Oktoberfest beer garden in Munich and detonated a bomb that killed dozens of people and injured more than 200. Kohler was a member of the Hoffman Militia, a German version of the survivalist militias in the U.S.</p>
<p>In 1992, two young Nazi skinheads firebombed the home of a Turkish family in Molin, Germany. Two children and their grandmother died in the blaze. The youthful killers in this case had been in contact with an American neo-Nazi group.</p>
<p>After the Molin deaths, Ingo Hasselbach, a former Nazi recruiter in eastern Germany, renounced white supremacism. He wrote in the <em>New York Times</em> (April 26, 1995), “Extremist groups in America and Europe create a climate through printed propaganda and computer networks that encourage young people who might be antisocial to go over the edge and commit violent acts…The rightwing… movement is a loose network of people with a great deal of hatred and potential for violence, and all over the world they are constantly exchanging information. Indoctrination is a slow, careful process, in which leaders like I used to be incite newcomers step-by-step.”</p>
<p>Klebold and Harris must be seen in a larger social framework than that provided by their family histories, school problems or wardrobe preferences. They were the ideal cannon fodder for grown-up Nazis.</p>
<p>Scapegoated and abused at their high school, they looked, consciously or unconsciously, for an ideology that put them on top, that gave them power. And they found it in neo-Nazi German rock music and the ideology of white supremacy. Klebold, whose great-grandfather was Jewish, separated himself from this heritage in his embittered need to be <strong><em>superior to someone.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Colorado’s history of ultra-right violence.</strong> These are not the first politically motivated murders in Colorado.</p>
<p>In 1984, Alan Berg, a Jewish talk-show host, was gunned down outside his home by members of The Order of the Silent Brotherhood, an Aryan Nations offshoot. In 1997, over a one-week period, racist Denver skinheads executed an African immigrant at a bus stop, shot and paralysed a nurse who came to his aid, and also ambushed and killed a policeman.</p>
<p>Among the far-right groups and spokespeople who call Colorado home are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Coors family which bankrolls National Empowerment Television, whose director William Lind has noted, “If we are going to rescue our culture, we need a lot more hate.” <em> Focus on the Family, which played a major role in the passage of Amendment 2, a state anti-gay law. </em> The Posse Comitatus whose members were arrested in 1982 for conspiring to kill two federal judges and to blow-up the Internal Revenue Service building in Denver. * Pete Peters, a Christian Identity radio preacher, who is credited with launching the U.S. militia movement in the 1990s.</li>
</ul>
<p>These political influences provide the backdrop for the Columbine killings. While the adult leaders of some of these groups generally limit their hatemongering to words, young people are more likely to use fists, knives, guns, Doc Marten boots, and bombs.</p>
<p><strong>The solution is collective action.</strong> The prescription for the political illness of fascism is education and community mobilisation against the Hitlerites and in support of all those targeted by them.</p>
<p>Justin Norman, a Black athlete at Colombine High, told <em>Emerge</em> magazine: “I saw swastikas and stuff that said ‘White Power.’ The janitors would come in later and clean them off.” School officials apparently ignored signs of fascist activity like these.</p>
<p>Instead of closing their eyes, administrators, teachers, students and parents need to recognise and talk frankly about the dangers posed by fascist organisers in their midst or on the internet. When youth come to school in swastika- emblasoned clothes, the response should be teach-ins and school assemblies on what Nazism means and why the whole student body has an interest in taking a stand against racism, sexism, homophobia, anti-Semitism, anti- communism, and ultra-nationalism.</p>
<p>And advocates of white supremacy in the wider society should be met by community protests and rallies.</p>
<p>United Front Against Fascism (UFAF), a Seattle-based coalition of unionists, feminists, people of color, Jews, gays and radicals, has successfully picketed numerous white supremacist events over the last 10 years. Most recently, UFAF organised protests exposing Ku Klux Klan recruiters in Auburn, Washington and the Nazi rock band Blood Axis, led by Michael Moynihan, which was scheduled to play at a Seattle club as part of a tour last year. The international publicity initiated by UFAF forced Blood Axis to cancel appearances in both the U.S. and Europe.</p>
<p>In order to prevent future massacres here or abroad, let us honour the dead at Littleton with a growing determination to combat the fascists who are trying to recruit our children.</p>

<h1>New Age Fascists: The dangerous politics of the Citizens Electoral Councils</h1>
<h2>IAN STOREY | Issue: 22 | SUMMER/AUTUMN 2000</h2>
<p><a href="https://socialism.com/fsb-article/new-age-fascists-the-dangerous-politics-of-the-citizens-electoral-councils/">source</a></p>
<p><em>Rural Queensland is fertile ground for reactionary populist groups. Isolation, withdrawal of services and sharp practices by the banks have given farming communities a lot to be angry about. In the late ’80s, the Citizens Electoral Councils (CEC) took root in these communities, set up by Eric Butler’s League of Rights. It campaigned around issues like farm subsidies, tariffs, economic growth and immigration controls. In the early ’90s, domination was wrested from Butler’s clique by followers of a U.S. rightwinger, Lyndon LaRouche.<strong>Ian Storey</strong> explains the evolution of LaRouche and argues the need for vigilance to prevent the CEC getting a toehold in the union movement.</em></p>
<p>After this change, the CEC moved into the cities. CEC members can now be found pushing literature on campuses and in suburban shopping centres. As with many far right organisations, it speaks to people in a language they want to hear, proposing solutions to their problems which on the surface sound plausible, but in fact are based on crazy conspiracy theories and vicious bigotry.</p>
<p>In a disturbing development, the CEC has begun to organise in the union movement in Melbourne.</p>
<p><strong>Populist conspiracy theories.</strong> Groups such as the League of Rights and the CEC usually attract a hard core of fascists, and typically fantasise about a crusade of historical proportions. LaRouche claims that he and his followers represent a 3,000-year-old faction of “Neo-Platonic humanists” locked in mortal struggle with an equally ancient intrigue that today includes the British royals, the British Secret Service, the “Zionist Lobby,” the Mafia, the IMF, the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banks and the former Soviet Secret Service.</p>
<p>CEC literature compares LaRouche favourably to Albert Einstein, and his theories cover everything from Confucianism to Chaos Theory. He is a zealous supporter of nuclear power and argues that there is a conspiracy to make radioactive material seem dangerous. A LaRouchite government would launch headlong into the implementation of nuclear power with, no doubt, little concern for the health effects to the average citizen. The CEC also claims that the greenhouse effect and the depletion of the ozone layer are conspiratorial hoaxes.</p>
<p>LaRouche has a particular obsession with the British Queen. “Of course she’s pushing drugs,” he once said. Predictably anti-semitic, the CEC claims that perhaps there were no Jews at all who perished in Nazi camps.</p>
<p><strong>From sexist loner to fascist demagogue.</strong> Dennis King, author of <em>Lyndon LaRouche and the New American Fascism</em> , relates that LaRouche, as a teenager, “withdrew into his books, took long walks in the woods, and accumulated an enormous resentment against his peers. He found solace in the great philosophers…whose works helped him rationalise his social situation.”</p>
<p>Somehow or other, LaRouche, then known as Lynn Marcus, drifted into the Trotskyist Socialist Workers Party (SWP) in the 1950s. Clara Fraser, who went on to found the Freedom Socialist Party, was then also a member of the SWP, and had dealings with him. “He never seemed to belong to any SWP branch; he was a loner. He was never active, never involved in any mass movement or internal organisational work. What he did was write — and write and write and write, until we all wished he’d be stricken by digital rheumatism… They said he was an economist, but nobody seemed to know where he worked or what he did. Sometimes I would feel sorry for him and go up and say hello; he never replied except in a mumble or a curt rejoinder. Once I mustered the audacity to ask him to explain his latest document. My polite interest invoked nothing but a look of utter contempt. I gave up on Lynn Marcus. Just one of those fringe eccentrics.”</p>
<p>Marcus left the SWP, resurfacing in 1968 as Lyndon LaRouche, a leader in an outfit called the National Caucus of Labor Committees (NCLC). Fraser recalled that their paper, New Solidarity, went berserk over the emergence of feminism. “Feminism is shit,” it roared one day. “Mothers are fuckers, the enemy, witches. Women are the Achilles heels of revolutionaries, the cause of IMPOTENCE. Women turn men into deviants, queers, and schlemiels (bumblers).”</p>
<p>These rantings had Fraser warning: “The man is a menace…In a few years he’ll have storm troopers to beat up on workers.” LaRouche had found his comfort zone in fascism. Here he could live out his Great Thinker fantasies, pumping out ill-informed conspiracy theories and pseudo-science. Currently in jail for taxation offences, this megalomaniac woman-hater is the “spiritual leader” of the CEC.</p>
<p><strong>Feeding on misery.</strong> At a time when the economy is booming for big corporations, small businesses are failing at a phenomenal rate. The CEC claims to offer hope to small business people, parading itself as their champion against big business and the banks, and promising low taxes and high tariffs.</p>
<p>Workers are facing a future in which there is little job security and falling real wages. For many people, electricity, gas and water supply are luxuries to be rationed, and decent food is increasingly a budgetary problem. Higher education, affordable housing, dental care and other health care have slipped from the grasp of many employed workers. For the unemployed, the situation is already desperate.</p>
<p>In typical rightwing fashion, the CEC resorts to scapegoating and bigotry to divert workers’ attention from the real game — the crushing of working class organisations. LaRouche has written that history would not judge harshly those persons who beat gay men to death with a baseball bat to stop the spread of AIDS. Women are treated as a threat to men’s jobs. Indigenous land rights, which in reality pose no threat at all to urban workers, are characterised as a Zionist conspiracy to divide the country, sponsored by the Queen’s husband! Immigrants are treated as sub-human invaders who pose a threat to the economic welfare of “our desirable nation.”</p>
<p>Subjected to even the lightest scrutiny, LaRouche’s theories are exposed as irrational nonsense. But Nazism is not concerned with debate. The CEC is attempting to build a mass movement of farmers, small business people and disaffected blue-collar workers to impose its program on society. Fascism, a creation of the 20th century, is still a real threat in the 21st.</p>
<p><strong>Populism is good for business.</strong> One million people voted for One Nation in the 1998 election. In response, the four major parties have moved rightward. A few boatloads of desperate refugees has provided the Federal Government with the opportunity to adopt Hansonite immigration policies. The ALP and Democrats voted with the government to preserve their slice of the redneck vote.</p>
<p>The rabid fear campaign against refugees is a version of the tactic used to impose the racist Ten Point Plan on Indigenous Australians. Wherever big business sees a threat to its domination, expect a vicious outpouring of bigotry in the media.</p>
<p>It would be nice to be able to close our eyes and wish the monster of fascism out of existence. Unfortunately, it is a counterpoint to capitalism at times of crisis. It sows confusion and creates a diversion away from the failures of the market system. The CEC is the modern face of an old scourge. Anti-fascist activists successfully tossed it out of pro-MUA rallies in 1998. This tactic should be followed wherever it emerges from its bunker. Nazis out of the unions!</p>

<h1>Crush incipient fascism whatever its guise: Build the campaign to shut down the patriarchal Blackshirts!</h1>
<h2>DEBBIE BRENNAN | Issue: 28 | SUMMER/AUTUMN 2003</h2>
<p><a href="https://socialism.com/fsb-article/crush-incipient-fascism-whatever-its-guise-build-the-campaign-to-shut-down-the-patriarchal-blackshirts/">source</a></p>
<p>I remember the morning I opened up the newspaper to find a huge spread on a Christian fundamentalist “men’s rights” group calling itself the Blackshirts. I felt sick. A couple of nights earlier, a Radical Women meeting featured a talk on the Citizens Electoral Council, adherents of American fascist Lyndon LaRouche (See “LaRouche: Fascism Restyled for the New Milennium.”) Both organisations are centred in Moreland, my neighbourhood and home to a diverse, multicultural working class population.</p>
<p>Blackshirts leader, John Abbott, owns the Dane Centre, a well-known recording studio. The centre is close to Moreland’s thriving hub on Sydney Road, and just a couple of blocks from Solidarity Salon, organising centre for Radical Women and the Freedom Socialist Party. It’s not clear if the Blackshirts formally organise out of the centre, but the presence of Abbott is an outrage in itself.</p>
<p>Dressed from head to toe in black, and masked with bandanas and sunglasses, the paramilitary appearance of the Blackshirts is definitely menacing. On their sleeves is an insignia with Aboriginal boomerangs formed into an “SS.” When asked by a reporter about this hearkening back to Nazi Germany, Abbott answered point blank: “I have no problem with fascism.”</p>
<p>The Blackshirts regularly demonstrate outside the Family Court, calling for the repeal of Australia’s no-fault divorce laws and a penalty for “adultery.” Quoting extensively from the Bible, they regard marriage as an institution “belonging to God” and rights for women and queers an abomination. These men (there’s a token woman as well!) stalk women, who leave them (usually after years of violent abuse) and win custody of the children. Appearing outside an ex-partner’s home to proselytise their Kinder, Küche, Kirche ideology, they blitz the neighbourhood with leaflets full of vile slander, attempting to terrorise their victims and recruit like-minded brethren.</p>
<p>The sexist tabloid media paints these guys as a militant angry men’s group. Great for whipping up fear — and giving a platform for their fanatical views. Yes, the Blackshirts are a bunch of misogynist, homophobic bullies trying to bring back the “man’s castle.” But they didn’t appear from nowhere, and they’re not a new phenomenon. Abbott’s endorsement of fascism goes straight to the core of this deadly ideology: its hatred of women.</p>
<p><strong>Learn from history.</strong> Today’s conditions are reminiscent of the 1920s and ’30s — economic crisis and spreading scarcity, the Federal Government’s decimation of social services and its pressure on working women to return to the home, and people’s disorientation in the chaos of capitalism in its death throes.</p>
<p>After 1914, Europe was in upheaval. In 1917, during World War I, the Russian workers and peasants threw out first the feudal Tsarist aristocracy and then the weak capitalist class. After the war, much of Europe was in devastating recession. In Italy, big business had been stung by the Treaty of Versailles, which formally ended the war. Its Allies, Britain, France and the U.S.A, reneged on promises of new territories. Workers were occupying the factories and tenant farmers the estates of their landlords. Desperate to thwart the rise of socialism, Italy’s leading industrialists turned to Benito Mussolini and his gangs of armed thugs, the Fasci, who roamed the country — clad in black shirts. In Germany, whose economy was destroyed by Versailles, there was a failed workers’ revolution. There too, the capitalists funded the fascists. Using anti-worker terror, mass propaganda and appeals to legitimate grievances, Hitler’s Nazi Party was elected to power, because there had been no united grassroots organising to stop it. Then followed 12 years of bloody terror. The workers’ movement was crushed and Europe was submerged in another all-out war.</p>
<p>One of the features of Nazism was its insistence on racial, ideological and gender conformity. Those who did not match the official profile were deemed “unfit.” And so millions of activists, Jews, ethnic minorities, queers and independent women were sent to concentration camps and either murdered or used as slave labour. In hospitals and institutions across Germany and the occupied territories, disabled people were murdered by lethal injection.</p>
<p>The emergence of Abbott, who has “no problem with fascism,” must be seen in this context: if the capitalist class is going to carry out this remake of society, it has to control women. We’ve always been crucial to the profit system. To survive, it needs us to reproduce the next generation, to care for it from cradle to grave and to be the workforce which sets the lowest benchmark for wages and conditions. When economic crisis tears society apart, women not only shoulder the blame, we’re given the responsibility to hold it together.</p>
<p>The Howard Government is not fascist, but its “family values” policies encourage the likes of Blackshirts. Fascism feeds on scarcity, and its ideas appear attractive to working people who are doing it hard. Among the Blackshirts are working men who face mandatory deductions for Child Support that seem disproportionate in comparison to their meagre take-home pay. Instead of following John Abbott, working class men should join women in a movement that opposes the privatisation of care and demands that corporate business be taxed to fund these supports. But to convince them of that requires a clear political answer to their grievances, real and perceived.</p>
<p><strong>Building community resistance.</strong> Diversity in Safe Communities (DiSC) formed in August 2002, after the Blackshirts targeted two Brunswick women who confronted Abbott while he was being interviewed on their street by a TV crew. Assuming the women were lesbians — because they were sharing a house — Abbott threatened them with “a visit.” The Blackshirts did return with their megaphones, stuffing neighbours’ letterboxes with their homophobic poison.</p>
<p>The women called a meeting, which was held at Solidarity Salon. On short notice, more than 20 people from the local neighbourhood, community legal centres and socialist movement showed up and started planning a public campaign launch.</p>
<p>The municipality of Moreland is a tested battleground between fascists and anti-fascists. Its high unemployment and rundown services attract the likes of National Action, a Nazi group run out of town by a multi-movement campaign in 1994, the LaRouchites and now the Blackshirts. With a large population of migrants and refugees, queers and single mothers to scapegoat, they try to appeal to white folks facing hardship — so far, without success. Many residents are people who fled repression — predominantly from Italy, Turkey and Eastern Europe. The area is the base for several international Left groups. The thriving Wills branch of Socialist Alliance is in Brunswick. Multicultural working class solidarity is entrenched, and fascist ideology is just not on.</p>
<p>This mood was palpable at DiSC’s launch in September, which packed out Brunswick Town Hall. About 250 attended, and the atmosphere was fiery. People from all ages were there, including those with memories of life under fascism. The diverse platform of speakers included Council of Single Mothers and Their Children, a local lesbian mother and Radical Women. The meeting was receptive to this strong feminist voice and RW’s call for a united front that stands up for women’s liberation. The vote to hold a protest rally outside the Dane Centre was almost unanimous (2 against). In contrast, a motion to negotiate with the Blackshirts got an angry thumbs down. A woman speaking against it said: “There is nothing to negotiate over. I don’t want a half-racist society, and I don’t want my kids growing up in a society that is a ‘little bit’ homophobic.”</p>
<p>So Brunswick said: Shut down the Blackshirts. Period!</p>
<p><strong>Socialism or fascism.</strong> DiSC provides the potential for the inclusive, broad-based and democratic campaign needed to rid the streets of the Blackshirts before they grow. History points to the urgency for the union, socialist, feminist, queer, Indigenous, refugee and anti-war movements to unite around feminist demands — such as the rights of women and all minorities to reproductive freedom, jobs and equal pay, fully-funded supports and services. Economic independence for women, whoever we are, is the bottom line if we’re to make our own choices (including the relationships we have) and claim our place in society, respected as equals and leaders. Women’s wellbeing is the measuring rod for the rest of society. Fascism would drive us all down so a few can continue to prosper. Socialism would enable us all to enjoy the collective wealth.</p>
<p>The capitalist system has run its course. Abbott’s gang is a symptom of how vicious things will turn if the power of the corporate world is not challenged. A decisive defeat of these 21st century blackshirt thugs would embolden and rally our side for the battles ahead.</p>

<h1>Dateline U.S.A. – LaRouche: Fascism Restyled for the New Millennium</h1>
<h2>HELEN GILBERT | Issue: 28 | SUMMER/AUTUMN 2003</h2>
<p><a href="https://socialism.com/fsb-article/dateline-u-s-a-larouche-fascism-restyled-for-the-new-millennium/">source</a></p>
<p>Nine years out of prison, Lyndon LaRouche is once again campaigning to be U.S. president. But his influence reaches beyond the U.S.A. to Europe, Latin America, the Middle East, Australia and elsewhere via electoral campaigns, speaking engagements, a host of well-funded organizations, and the media, including his own numerous publications and web sites.</p>
<p>LaRouche writes reams of endless treatises expounding on everything from politics and economy to science, philosophy, and a campaign to revise the tuning of the musical scale. Much of his writing appears to be kooky, boring or esoteric, and his actual program is hard to ferret out.</p>
<p>But for anyone concerned with making social change, it’s important to get to the bottom of LaRouche’s ideology. He is making a big appeal to youth, and his adherents are making their presence increasingly felt on campuses and on the fringes of the mass movements. And based on transcripts of discussion at a LaRouchite conference in 2002, his young followers clearly feel that LaRouche has provided them with a sense of purpose and a world view that offers answers to absolutely everything.</p>
<p>Part of LaRouche’s allure is his opposition to free trade and call for replacing globalism with protectionist national policies. On this platform, a Brazilian LaRouche supporter, Dr. Eneas Carneiro of the rightist Party for Rebuilding of National Order, was overwhelmingly elected to Congress last year.</p>
<p>Concerted digging, however, shows LaRouche’s program to be reactionary to the core, firmly grounded in sexism, anti-Semitism, racism, and homophobia — and topped off with loopy, anti-scientific disavowals of everything from evolution to the need for environmental protections. Political novices who assume that there is something progressive about LaRouche because his followers are attending anti-war and pro-Palestinian actions need to be educated and warned: the man and his politics are fascist.</p>
<p><strong>From leftist to far-right conspiracy theorist.</strong> For 15 years, Lyndon LaRouche was part of the U.S. Socialist Workers Party. In 1965, he split from the SWP, and during the 1970s, in reaction to the feminist movement, he went berserk. He published venomous, misogynist, racist, heterosexist, paranoid ravings in his newspaper and instigated physical attacks on leftists.</p>
<p>But LaRouche also proceeded to build up a huge empire, thanks in part to a fundraising operation that included spying on activists for the U.S. and other governments. In 1989, he was convicted of tax evasion and milking $34 million dollars from senior citizens. (For more detailed background, see <em>Lyndon LaRouche and the New American Fascism</em> by Dennis King and the essay “LaRouche: Sex Maniac and Demagogue” in Clara Fraser’s <em>Revolution, She Wrote</em>.)</p>
<p>Since getting out of prison in 1994, LaRouche has reconstructed his network of propaganda, but has toned down his approach from its hysterical peak. Today, the Nazi-like elements of his politics are quite undercover — to the point that his own supporters can be unaware of them.</p>
<p>LaRouche’s anti-Semitism, however, is still fairly apparent — and connected to his anti-British sentiment, a pillar of his philosophy. He links his two villains with the assertion that Britain is run by a cabal of Jewish banking families.</p>
<p>Along with invoking the classic anti-Semitic canard of the international Jewish banking conspiracy, LaRouche also retails the myth of an “Israeli spy network inside the U.S. government.” He blames the “ongoing drive to induce President George W. Bush to launch a war against Iraq” on Israeli government policy that is being “foisted” on Bush by this “nest of Israeli agents.”</p>
<p>Like other rightwingers, LaRouche is cynically promoting an anti-Semitic message, thinly coded as anti-Zionism, to anti-war and Palestine solidarity activists. His arguments are a case of pretending that the tail wags the dog. The war drive reflects the economic, political, and military needs of U.S. capitalism, which would drop support for Israel in a minute if its interests demanded it.</p>
<p>LaRouche views the current war drive not as an expression of imperialist interests, but as a conspiracy to destroy the U.S. economy. The internal engineers of the scheme are “a cult of utopian military lunatics, typified by Zbigniew Brzezinski, Samuel Huntington, Henry Kissinger, or the current Undersecretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz,” who are “the real masterminds behind the attacks of September 11.”</p>
<p>By October 2002, LaRouche was attributing Bush’s saber-rattling not only to external manipulation, but to mental instability. “No President of the United States could support such insane policies,” he stated, “unless he himself were clinically insane.” Based on Bush’s performance, one can see that this point of view, however anti-materialist, might find sympathizers.</p>
<p><strong>An unappetizing stew of racism, sexism, homophobia.</strong> In the past, LaRouche was not shy about his racism, which is tightly tied to his hatred of women. A 1973 essay was called “The Male Impotence of the Puerto-Rican Socialist Party” and a memo from the same period asked, “Can we imagine anything more viciously sadistic than the Black Ghetto mother?” LaRouche also cultivated relationships with white supremacists and spied for the apartheid regime in South Africa, according to Chip Berlet and Joel Ballman in the 1989 paper “Lyndon LaRouche: Fascism Wrapped in an American Flag.”</p>
<p>Today, LaRouche’s racism is usually not so explicit (except for occasional references to the British as sub-human baboons). This is not surprising, since he is attempting to appeal to Latin Americans, Arabs, and African Americans. In Seattle, the LaRouchies always attend the Martin Luther King Jr. Day march and give away tons of their newspapers.</p>
<p>Researcher Berlet reports that LaRouche seeks an alliance with anti-Semitic Black cultural nationalist leader Louis Farrakhan, and LaRouche articles have appeared in Farrakhan’s Nation of Islam publications. In the article “LaRouche’s Anti-semitic Conspiracism,” Berlet says, “LaRouche followers and representatives of the Nation of Islam have joined to present anti-semitic public presentations describing an alleged conspiracy of Freemasons and the B’nai B’rith to create and control the Ku Klux Klan.” Go figure <em>that</em> one out!</p>
<p>In Australia, the LaRouchite Citizens Electoral Council (CEC) opposes Aboriginal territorial rights. In rebutting criticism of a 1997 CEC document called “Aboriginal ‘Land Rights’: Prince Philip’s Racist Plot to Splinter Australia,” LaRouche said: “[T]he so-called ‘aborigines’ of Australia, given the opportunities, can accomplish as much as would be reasonably hoped for from a child of any human household.”</p>
<p>Similarly, LaRouche’s homophobia less often takes the form of overt, long- winded diatribes than in the past. In 1974, a lengthy rant by LaRouche included statements like: “Womanhood is the fellacio of the male mouth in a man who has been brainwashed by the KGB; that is sucking penises…Most women are to a large degree homosexual in this society. The relationship between daughter and mother is homosexual.”</p>
<p>LaRouche still regularly labels his opponents gay, however, and in 1986, he was behind Proposition 64, a California AIDS initiative which was actually a witchhunt against the queer community.</p>
<p>In an August 2002 question and answer session, LaRouche revealed the startling fact that homosexuality was largely “induced by bad, evil, in a sense, psychologists.” It was “part of the countercultural operation,” LaRouche said, “to try to find ways to promote strange kinds of sexuality, which had been fringe in society…on a large scale.” The headquarters of this experiment, according to LaRouche, was Berkeley, California — “one of the great engineering places where they mass-produced homosexuals, from divinity students.”</p>
<p><strong>Savior of capitalism.</strong> Although LaRouche disdains the “lunatic use of the term ‘capitalism,’ as used by Karl Marx and others,” his self-appointed mission is to rescue that very system. His prescription for doing this is a “New Bretton Woods,” an international conference that would bring back protectionist policies and a fixed exchange rate for the world’s currencies. He calls for the U.S. to return to “the American System of political-economy, expelling that ‘free trade’ doctrine against which all leading patriots of the U.S.A. have fought.”</p>
<p>LaRouchites see a Messianic role for the U.S. and the U.S. presidency in stabilizing the economy globally. According to an article in their August 2002 <em>Executive Intelligence Review</em> , “the very survival of the planet depends on effective leadership policy of the President of the United States.” To free George W. to take the necessary actions to save humanity, however, his Democratic Party opponents in “the McCain-Lieberman cabal must be crushed now.”</p>
<p>Among the other enemies of world salvation are environmentalists and the global justice movement.</p>
<p>According to a 1985 <em>Washington Post</em> story, LaRouchies told New Hampshire law enforcement officials in 1977 that the anti-nuclear Clamshell Alliance was a terrorist group financed by the Rockefellers. As a result, a nonviolent protest called by the group was met with the arrest of 1,400 people.</p>
<p>In 2001, at an August press conference about protests planned for the next month against the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, LaRouche took on the anti-corporate globalization movement, announcing: “All reports from reliable sources indicate that the international terrorist movement which surfaced at Seattle, mobilized itself at Porto Alegre, Brazil, and created bloody violence at Genoa, is now taking aim at the U.S. nation’s capital. It is extremely important that those elements of U.S. organized labor who have permitted their organizations to be entangled in sympathy for this terrorist gang, break openly from the terrorist-style riots now being prepared.” Although LaRouche spends 99 percent of his time writing about economics, this is one of his few references to workers’ unions, or the labor movement. In Australia, however, the Citizens Electoral Council has tried to recruit out of the unions.</p>
<p><strong>The need to propose an alternative.</strong> LaRouche is frequently dismissed as a nut, but people who study him say he’s a dangerous, <em>fascist</em> nut. As Clara Fraser said in her column: “The pundits are intrigued and puzzled by his amalgam of right and left politics, a tangled web of KKK, Freudian, encounter therapy, Populist, Ayn Rand-like, and Marxist notions. They needn’t be. His is the prototypical face of fascism, which is classically a hodgepodge of pseudo- theories crafted for mass appeal and calculated to bring about the glacial age law’n’order coveted by imperialists and impoverished super-patriots.”</p>
<p>As Leon Trotsky explained, fascism is a last-ditch effort to preserve capitalism — but one that attempts to attract a mass base of support by trumpeting opposition to big business and the status quo in order to win over the abused and disgruntled little guy. It employs mysticism, elevates the Great Leader, destroys unions and social movements, enslaves women, and scapegoats groups such as Jews, queers, and intellectuals for society’s ills. Even if muted in recent years, all these elements are present in LaRouche’s propaganda.</p>
<p>Whether the 80-year-old LaRouche can mobilize his cult followers into a full- blown mass fascist movement that survives him remains to be seen. But fighters for a better world should do everything possible to expose his destructive and paranoid message and provide a sane, humanitarian, socialist alternative to those who look to his movement for</p>

<h1>History provides invaluable lessons in how to stop fascism in its tracks</h1>
<h2>ALISON THORNE | Issue: 34 | SUMMER/AUTUMN 2006</h2>
<p><a href="https://socialism.com/fsb-article/history-provides-invaluable-lessons-in-how-to-stop-fascism-in-its-tracks/">source</a></p>
<p><em>![](<a href="https://socialism.com/wp">https://socialism.com/wp</a>- content/uploads/2018/05/FSB-34-article-21-211x300.png)![](<a href="https://socialism.com/wp">https://socialism.com/wp</a>- content/uploads/2018/05/FSB-34-article-21-211x300.png)The Fight Against Fascism in the U.S.A.</em> , by James P Cannon, Farrell Dobbs, Joseph Hansen, Leon Trotsky and Murry Weiss, Resistance Books (2004), ISBN 1876646179, 237 pages, $19.95.</p>
<p>In January 1997, a fascist outfit, National Action (NA), opened a bookshop in the multicultural Melbourne suburb of Fawkner. This development led to the reactivation of Campaign Against the Nazis (CAN), a united front of socialist organisations and progressive activists which years earlier drove these neo- Nazis out of nearby Brunswick. CAN again mobilised the broadest possible, disciplined protests to prevent National Action from putting down roots in Fawkner.</p>
<p>It also sparked a range of very familiar debates about the best way to respond to the threat of fascism. Members of the ALP, who dominated the local council, argued that the community should ignore NA, claiming that they’d just go away. In contrast, the International Socialist Organisation (ISO) called on the council to ban the group. The ISO previously had taken a similar approach of appealing to the State, demanding that the local council stop rightwing populist, Pauline Hanson, from using council buildings. The council obliged with a resolution that refused “divisive groups” access to facilities. It was no surprise when CAN — which was organising the community in expelling the fascists — got a phone call from the council to warn it about the new policy!</p>
<p><em>The Fight Against Fascism in the U.S.A.</em> is a fascinating collection of public and internal documents from the archives on the U.S. Socialist Workers Party, spanning the period from the 1930s to the 1970s. The debates thrown up during real struggles are essential reading for those serious about learning how to fight fascism.</p>
<p>Veterans from anti-fascist struggles put a compelling case that socialists should <em>never</em> appeal to the State to restrict the rights of any organisation — even fascists! But the contributions also deal with the subtleties of which tactics best suit conditions in different periods.</p>
<p>A 1939 contribution, “Should Fascists Be Allowed the Rights of Free Speech?,” urges working class activists not to be led off course by professional liberals and civil libertarians. It points to the hypocrisy of organisations like the American Civil Liberties Union: “The ACLU, apparently exhausted by its noble efforts on behalf of the Nazis, did not utter a peep about the democratic rights of free speech, assembly and picketing being denied the 50,000 anti-fascists who came to protest the Nazi rally.” The piece advises socialists to keep the emphasis squarely on the democratic rights of anti- fascists to demonstrate and speak out — not get caught up in abstract debates about liberals’ agendas.</p>
<p>In 1960 the Mayor of New York denied the American Nazi Party, led by George Lincoln Rockwell, a permit to hold a rally. SWP veteran, James P Cannon, was alarmed by the development and wrote to New Yorker Tom Kerry: “It sets a dangerous precedent. The reason he gave for denying the constitutional rights of the American ‘Nazi’ screwballs, and his incitement to violence against them, can be applied just as well and just as logically to us or any other minority. We will be greatly handicapped in fighting against such discriminations if we give direct or even indirect sanction to this treatment of others. People who demand free speech and constitutional rights for themselves but want to deny it for others do not get much public sympathy when their own rights are denied.”</p>
<p><strong>Theory and tactics.</strong> As well as providing useful insights into developing the most appropriate tactics, the collection educates about social movement history. The introduction by Malik Miah, a Black civil rights activist who was a leader of the SWP for many years, explains the centrality of this question for Trotskyists. It was the failure of the mass socialist and communist parties of Europe to unite and use the power of the working class to stop the rise of fascism that led to the formation of the Fourth International after Trotsky concluded that these parties could not be reformed. Miah explains: “The political strategy of the Marxists, called Trotskyists, remains a key method of struggle to take on rightist formations and incipient fascists. The SWP was an active participant and builder of the anti-fascist movement. The SWP members, particularly those in trade unions, followed a strategy of counter-mobilisation to fight the incipient fascist groups and advocated the formation of workers’ defence guards to defend working class organisations. Liberals who opposed fascists, on the other hand, focused on relying on the capitalist courts and legislatures to stand up to the fascists.”</p>
<p>A key issue addressed in the book is how to recognise fascism and incipient fascist movements. While agreeing with the importance of confronting Rockwell and his Nazi Party, Cannon says: “the real American fascists look more like Mayor Hague, Senator McCarthy, possibly Senator Goldwater. It can be put down with absolute assurance that in no case will they wear Nazi uniforms, swastikas and praise Hitler. To picture Rockwell’s outfit as representing American fascism thus helps create the illusions that the real fascists, when they show up, will be identifiable with similar ease and will similarly openly stir up the most violent antipathies, including those of the most patriotic Americans.”</p>
<p>The opening selection in the collection is a pamphlet titled <em>Father Coughlin: Fascist Demagogue</em> , written by Joseph Hansen. During the 1930s, in the context of economic crisis and widespread disillusionment in President Roosevelt, various fascist movements began to emerge. One was called the Social Justice Movement, led by Reverend Charles E Coughlin, the “radio priest” whose speeches were broadcast on 48 stations. Hansen clearly explains what fascism is: “First, it is a wide mass movement of farmers and small business who face bankruptcy, of youth denied a future under capitalism, of sections of the unemployed. All these layers of the oppressed who are seeking desperately to put their hands on the surrounding plenty become hypnotised by the silver-plated promises of a demagogue who regiments them into blindly obedient shock troops.</p>
<p>“Secondly, it is financed and controlled by the very capitalists who above all are anxious to keep the revolutionary violence of the masses from turning against them. In America — the DuPonts, the Morgans, the Rockefellers — the Sixty Families.</p>
<p>“To the rank and file followers of fascism, at first it seems a genuine revolutionary way out of their misery. They discover the truth too late. The capitalists provide the money. The dictator provides the powerful slogans, the stirring names, the demagogic program, the organisation, the lieutenants, and the oratory.”</p>
<p>In short, fascism is used by the capitalist State as a last resort in the face of growing working class dissent. Fascism crushes bourgeois democratic norms in order to save the free market and private property.</p>
<p>Coughlin used a great deal of social justice rhetoric, but among his 16 points for social justice was a call for the preservation of private property. “Devotion to capitalism and preservation of private property,” argues Cannon, “is the holy bible of fascism.” Coughlin opposed social security, advising the ruling class to regiment labour and quash its capacity to fight big capital. He was pro-war and proselytised the need for a bigger army and navy. His “vision” for addressing unemployment was of jobless youth “marching behind bayonets.”</p>
<p>Another invaluable selection is Joseph Hansen’s response to two comrades who argued that Senator Joseph McCarthy was not an incipient fascist, as characterised by the party majority, but merely a “bourgeois democrat.” Hansen acknowledged that, at the time, McCarthyism was far from being fully formed fascism. McCarthy hadn’t built his own party, instead continuing to operate as a faction in the Republican and, to some extent, Democratic Party ranks. But his aim — the destruction of bourgeois democratic norms — was clear, hence the characterisation of him as an incipient fascist.</p>
<p><strong>Building broad support.</strong> The Freedom Socialist Party’s (FSP) Trotskyist tradition of fighting fascism is firmly rooted in this book. The FSP split from the SWP in 1966 around a range of questions, including opposition to Black nationalism and the centrality of women’s liberation.</p>
<p>A fascinating piece in the book is by Murry Weiss, a leader of SWP in Los Angeles who later joined the FSP. Weiss reports on organising against Gerald LK Smith. At the end of World War II, there was a revival in fascist activity. In 1945 Smith embarked on a national tour of the U.S. with the aim of building a mass base. Weiss describes a situation where the leadership of most sectors in the union movement were passive, and the leadership of the Stalinist Communist Party was tailending the unions. In this climate, the challenge was how to mobilise mass opposition. Weiss describes how the SWP was able to build united front action among the ranks of Stalinists, which eventually forced the Communist Party to come on board.</p>
<p>The emphasis of the SWP campaign was to make the organised working class conscious of who Smith was and why he was so dangerous. Weiss explains, “the line of the campaign was to mobilise the organised forces of the working class for a struggle against Smith. We reasoned: Smith is here to build a mass movement; to win financial support from the influential capitalists; to organise combat groups; to unite all reactionary forces under a single banner; to explode the tinder box of racial tension into riots and pogroms; to turn it all into an attack on the labour movement and on the unemployed who tomorrow will struggle for jobs and security. But Smith is only in the initial stage of his campaign. Therefore we must not allow him to gain time and a foothold but we must smash back with great power and boldness, with overwhelming preponderance of force.”</p>
<p>The key message of <em>The Fight Against Fascism in the U.S.A.</em> is that incipient fascist movements must be identified early and confronted by a broad, democratic and disciplined united front. Taking on rightwing populists and fascists must be done collectively, not in an individualistic or adventurist manner. We also need to assess the balance of forces. In a short piece about organising during the depression era, Felix Morrow says, “a very fruitful discussion can be had on the extremely delicate problems connected with calling upon the workers to fight against the fascists: when to speak purely in defensive terms, and when to go over to terms indicating an offensive against the fascists.”</p>
<p>When 50,000 people responded to the SWP’s call to action, despite the opposition of union, liberal, social democratic, Stalinist and mainstream “leaders,” <em>that</em> was an anti-fascist movement exercising its democratic right to free speech! This happened in New York on the 20th of February 1939 in opposition to plans by the German-American Bund to hold a mass fascist rally. The book is full of stories from real life struggles such as this. It is also a tool kit for how to organise a workers’ defence guard, a disciplined mass rally, or a united front. Along with classics such as <em>Trotsky’s Fascism: What is it and how to fight it?,</em> Daniel Guerin’s <em>Fascism and Big Business</em> , the feminist anthology <em>When Biology Became Women’s Destiny</em> and Helen Gilbert’s <em>LaRouche: Fascism Restyled for a New Millennium, The Fight Against Fascism in the U.S.A.</em> is an excellent addition to any serious anti-fascist fighter’s bookshelf.</p>

<h1>Cronulla Riot: Unions must mobilise against racism and fascism</h1>
<h2>Unknown | Issue: 34 | SUMMER/AUTUMN 2006</h2>
<p><a href="https://socialism.com/fsb-article/cronulla-riot-unions-must-mobilise-against-racism-and-fascism/">source</a></p>
<p><strong>Out of the sewer.</strong> Long time Nazi fanatic, James Saleam, founder of the thankfully defunct National Action, has rallied a small group of thugs, ultranationalists and racists into an outfit called the Patriotic Youth League, which orchestrated the Cronulla riot. Drunken racist goons, who wanted to defend “their” beaches and “their” women attacked anybody who looked like a “Lebo Muslim.” The Lebanese community already had been smeared by former NSW Premier Bob Carr after several high profile sexual assault cases. It was therefore easy for Saleam to whip up fear after a couple of sexist jerks — who happened to be Lebanese —made life unpleasant for some Anglo beachgoers. Really, he was only picking up where “Aussie Bob” left off.</p>
<p><strong>Dog whistle politics</strong> is a term used first to describe the tactics of British Prime Minister, Tony Blair. It refers to the way in which Blair managed to appeal to rednecks in Britain while using ostensibly inclusive language. The phrase “the Muslim community is not responsible for terrorism” is a signal, too, for those who want to hear that Muslims are in the firing line, and it’s OK to hate them.</p>
<p><strong>Unions must intervene.</strong> Howard knows all about the dog whistle. His 1996 election slogan was “for all of us,” a phrase clearly intended to whip up bigotry — “us” versus “them.” Then came the “war on terror.” Who benefits? The big end of town and the fascists. Now that Howard has clearly decided to govern for his corporate masters only, the union movement needs to mobilise, and not only in the interests of its millions of members. Next time some would-be führer sends out the call for a racist rally, there must be a large union contingent mobilised to shut it down and run the Nazis out of town. Racism is a union issue!</p>

<h1>Facing down Nazis and other white supremacists</h1>
<h2>Unknown | Issue: 36 | SUMMER/AUTUMN 2007</h2>
<p><a href="https://socialism.com/fsb-article/facing-down-nazis-and-other-white-supremacists/">source</a></p>
<p><strong>On December 9, 2006</strong> , a couple of hundred people gathered outside the Islamic Information and Support Centre in Melbourne’s multicultural suburb of Brunswick. The Freedom Socialist Party and Radical Women were among those who responded to an appeal to be there as a defence in case of an attack by white supremacists.</p>
<p>Days before, plans for an anti-Muslim provocation at the mosque hit the press. Clearly alluding to the 2005 Cronulla riots, the organisers’ purpose was to fan the misogynist, racist nationalism that spurred them. Riddled with references to “Aussie values” and demonising Muslim men as rapists, the PR called for the deportation of three prominent Muslim leaders and the introduction of restrictive citizenship legislation to “weed out extremists.”</p>
<p><strong>Fascists are not new to Brunswick.</strong> Over the past 15 years, FSP and RW have been involved in anti-Nazi organising in the area, each time successfully running these would-be führers out of town. Brunswick is typical of Melbourne’s working class neighbourhoods that include young, white men with no prospect of a decent job, who are prepared to accept white, straight, male supremacist explanations for their plight. It’s no coincidence that fascists were also involved in the riots on Cronulla beach.</p>
<p><strong>Once again, the Nazis chickened out.</strong> Several were spotted not far from the mosque but, cowards that they are, they decided not to take on the crowd. As Muslims and non-Muslims socialised, discussions were about the importance of defending each other. People well understood that the Muslim community is the target today, and socialists, feminists, unionists and queers would be next — unless we stop a fascist movement from growing.</p>
<p>The strong mood of solidarity on that blazing Saturday afternoon was a good antidote to the 42-degree heat. It will have to stay powerful for the times ahead.</p>

<h1>Unprecedented mass reaction to the assassination of Benazir Bhutto</h1>
<h2>FAROOQ TARIQ | Issue: 38 | SUMMER/AUTUMN 2008</h2>
<p><a href="https://socialism.com/fsb-article/unprecedented-mass-reaction-to-the-assassination-of-benazir-bhutto/">source</a></p>
<p><em>We are pleased to publish this slightly abridged version of a statement by the Labour</em></p>
<p>Party of Pakistan (LPP), issued by General Secretary Farooq Tariq, on 29 December 2007, just two days after the assassination of opposition leader, Benazir Bhutto. This working class view from inside Pakistan tells a story of struggle that the mainstream media has failed to report.</p>
<p><em>Since this piece was written, the Pakistani government of President Pervez Musharraf</em> has announced that the elections planned for January 8 will be postponed until 18 February. This six-week delay has been widely criticised by opposition parties as another attempt by Musharraf to maintain his crumbling military regime.</p>

Photo from <a href="http://thehindu.com">thehindu.com</a>.</p>
<p>Pakistan has never seen so many people protesting in streets as we’ve seen over the last two days. Right across Pakistan, they’ve united to condemn the brutal murder of Benazir Bhutto. Immediate mass anger erupted in all parts of the country and the news was received with a great shock. December 28 was the first day of a general strike called by many groups ranging from political parties to various professional groups.</p>
<p>The first targets were most of Pakistan Muslim League Quid Azam (PMLQ) election posters, banners, flags and billboards. The PMLQ is a major split from Pakistan Muslim League, which is headed by Nawaz Sharif, the former prime minister. The PMLQ — comprised of the most corrupt feudalists, capitalists, former army generals and black marketers — has been in a power-sharing arrangement with General Musharraf since 2002.</p>
<p>PMLQ had spent billions on advertising material and all that was gone within few hours of mass reaction. The work to remove this anti-people election material was executed with utmost sophistication. None of Pakistan Peoples Party or Nawaz’s Pakistan Muslim League election material was removed.</p>
<p>Then it was the turn of the banks, mainly in the province of Sind. They were attacked and buildings burned. Most ATM machines were destroyed. Banks have made unprecedented profits during the last few years. There is no free banking anymore.</p>
<p>Hundreds of private buses were burned in all parts of the country. Fares skyrocketed during Musharraf’s eight years of rule and public buses ceased operating. Most of PMLQ government ministers have their own bus companies and make huge gains out of mass poverty.</p>
<p>There were also incidents of trains being burnt in Sind. According to <em>Daily Jang</em> , 28 railway stations, 13 railway engines, and seven trains have been burnt, resulting-losses of over three billion Rupees. Rail fares were also subject to massive increases by the Musharraf regime in a bid to reduce the railway losses. The system has been partly privatised as well. Since 27 December, the whole rail system has collapsed. Thousands of passengers are waiting on the railway stations. But there is no sign of restoration for some days. Pakistan International Airlines and two private airlines, Air Blue and Shaheen Air, have cancelled all their domestic flights in the name of “rescheduling.” The truth? Their staff did not turn up.</p>
<p>Thousands of private cars have been damaged all over Pakistan by the angry mobs, mainly youth. They were showing their anger on the car companies’ (mainly Toyota, Suzuki and Honda) unprecedented profits during the last few years. Many leasing companies have robbed the growing middle classes by offering cars with abnormal prices — while the massive majority of population no longer have subsidised public transport.</p>
<p>Another target are the houses and offices of PMLQ politicians. Local government mayors and administrators are the other victims of the mass reaction with official buildings either burnt or damaged.</p>
<p>Over 100 people have so far died in the incidents relating to mass protest. This has been due to shooting by the police or from crossfire between different groups during the last 40 hours.</p>
<p>Thousands and thousands of protesters have raised slogans against both the Musharraf regime and American imperialism since the death of Benazir Bhutto. The anger that has accumulated during the last eight years has spilled over after this unthinkable incident.</p>
<p>This is a response from the masses to the strict implementation of the neoliberal agenda, which has resulted in unprecedented price hikes, unemployment and poverty. Mass anger, previously shown by those boycotting or participating in the elections, has spilled over early in response to the assassination of Benazir Bhutto.</p>
<p>All over Pakistan the anti-Musharraf consciousness is great. It’s been shown, to a different degree, in different ways right across the country. The so-called capitalist economical growth under Musharraf has left millions in absolute poverty. While the dictatorship’s propaganda website — Pakistan Shining — argues that Pakistan is becoming “a shining example of a tolerant and progressive society,” the reality looks rather different.</p>
<p>2007 has been a year of mass awakening. It started with lawyers’ movement after the removal of Ifikhar Choudry as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Pakistan.</p>
<p>The Chief Justice said “No” when the generals pressured him into resigning. He was removed, but reinstated on 20th July, after a massive movement of 80,000 lawyers. They were joined by political activists from almost all political parties, but not by the masses. The masses only welcomed the chief justice from the side roads; they did not actively participate in the movement for his reinstatement.</p>
<p>Then Musharraf got himself elected as president for the second five-year term in a “democratic manner” by a parliament elected for one five-year term. He was still wearing the military uniform when elected as a “civilian” president. His theme was “elect me president for the second term and I will take off the uniform after taking oath as a civilian president.”</p>
<p>The November imposition of martial law in the name of an “emergency” was used to remove the rather independent top judges of Pakistan. The law also put restrictions on the media; over 10,000 were arrested.</p>
<p>So Musharraf got himself duly elected president and took off his uniform after removing the top judges. His handpicked judges gave him all the necessary backing. Benazir Bhutto who, in the words of Tariq Ali, was forced into an “arranged marriage” by U.S. and British imperialism helped him in this process. In this unholy alliance, everyone was cheating everyone with utmost honesty.</p>
<p>After large-scale repression and the removal of an independent judiciary, Musharraf announced general elections for January 8th and lifted the emergency. The regime was happy that everything was going according to “plan.” The three major parties — Benazir Bhutto’s Pakistan Peoples Party, Nawaz Sharif’s Pakistan Muslim League and Quid Azam (PMLQ) — had all greed to participate in these fraudulent elections. The religious fundamentalist political alliance (MMA) had split over the question of participation, with a major part contesting in the election.</p>
<p>But when the religious fundamentalist struck and killed Benazir Bhutto on the evening of 27th December, the “plan” was shattered into pieces. It was a big blow to the agreed terms and conditions of various participating parties. It was not a bump on the road to conciliation and compromise but a total destruction of the road.</p>
<p>The murder of Benazir Bhutto is a double-edged sword. While it is a big blow to the plans of British and American imperialism, it will not cause celebration for the religious fundamentalist forces. The initial anger has gone against the military regime and its crony politicians. But it can go against the fundamentalists as well. No party will be able to celebrate the shocking killings.</p>
<p>The Musharraf regime has understood this clearly and now is consciously trying to steer the direction of the movement against the religious fundamentalists. On the 28th December, in a two-hour press conference, a military brigadier, representing the government, named Baitullah Mehsud, an Al-Qaeda associate in tribal areas of Pakistan, as the one who carried out the attack.</p>
<p>Foolishly the military officer tried his best to prove that Benazir Bhutto, while waving to crowds after the bomb blast, was not killed by a bullet but by the lever of the sunroof in the bullet proof car. What difference does it make if it is proven that Benazir Bhutto was not killed by the bullet but in another way? Not much.</p>
<p>The military brigadier’s explanation did not satisfy the angry journalists, who asked him again and again about the connection between Pakistan’s Inter Services Intelligence (ISI) and Abdullah Mehsud. Their question went unanswered: Why was Mahsood released quietly on the day emergency law was imposed, the same day that over 200 Pakistan army men, kidnapped by Mehsud’s group the week before, were also released? The ISI has had a relationship with religious fundamentalists dating back to the ’80s, when imperialists and fundamentalists were close friends.</p>
<p>It is a very volatile, unstable, unpredictable, explosive, dangerous, impulsive, fickle and capricious political situation. It has been many years since mass reaction has erupted to this degree. The general strike was a total success. All roads were empty. No traffic at all.</p>
<p>All shops were closed. All industrial and other institutions were completely shut down. After the initial inhibition to curb the strike, the regime has now issued strict orders to kill anyone on the spot if there is any “looting.” It has called the regular army into 16 districts of the Sind provinces and paramilitary forces elsewhere in Pakistan.</p>
<p>The regime has not postponed the scheduled election so far, but it will be very difficult to hold it on 8th January. Nawaz’s Muslim League and several other political parties have already announced their intention to boycott the fraudulent election.</p>
<p>The Labour Party Pakistan is demanding the immediate resignation of the Musharraf dictatorship and the forming of an interim government comprised of civil society organizations, trade unions and peasant organizations. This government would then proceed to hold free and fair general elections under an independent election commission.</p>
<p>The LLP is also demanding immediate restoration of the top judges and their convening an investigation into the two attempts on Benazir Bhutto’s life. Further, as part of the All Parties Democratic Movement, the LPP is supporting a three-day general strike, linking it to the overthrow of the military dictatorship. It is asking that all parties reject the general election fraud on 8th January.</p>
