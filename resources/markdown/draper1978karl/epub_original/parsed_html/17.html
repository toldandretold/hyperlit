<div class="indent" id="ch09--2">
      Around the latter part of 1848 and early 1849, Marx gave up the expectation that the bourgeoisie might come
      through after all.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch09--3">
      This was not an easy conclusion to come to, since—in the absence of a crystal ball to foresee alternative
      roads—it suggested that in Germany the road of progressive economic modernization might be closed or long
      delayed. Marx did not adopt the conclusion on some given day; on the contrary, there are many signs of groping
      and oscillation, as might be expected of militants who were trying to understand an unexpected development, not
      in a library carrel a hundred years later but in the hurly-burly of revolutionary events.

<h3 class="h2" id="ch09lev1">1. WRITING OFF THE BOURGEOISIE</h3>
<div class="indent" id="ch09--5">
      Even as early as July 1848 there was already an element of ambiguity in the following passage in an article by
      Marx:
    </div>
<div class="bq1" id="ch09--6">
      The [Hansemann ministry] wants to establish the rule of the bourgeoisie while at the same time striking a
      compromise with the old police- and feudal state. In this two-sided and contradictory task, at every turn it sees
      the still-to-be-established rule of the bourgeoisie and its own existence frustrated by the reactionary forces of
      the absolutist, feudal type—and it will succumb to the latter. The bourgeoisie cannot fight it out for its own
      rule without temporarily taking the people as a whole as its ally, hence without coming out more or less
      democratically.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch09--7"><a class="calibre14" id="ch09fn1"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch09fn1-r" id="ch09--9">1</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="noindentt" id="ch09--10">
      There is the direct statement that “it will succumb,” but the next <a class="calibre6" id="page_230"></a>implication is that “it
      will succumb <em class="calibre8" id="ch09--12">unless</em> … The second view, in fact, remained the operative line for months.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch09--13">
      A month before, in the eloquent article in which Marx defended the June uprising of the Paris workers, his
      bitterness toward the bourgeois executioners of the revolt did not prevent him from asking, toward the end of the
      article, whether this “deep gulf that has opened before us” should lead one to think that the fight for a
      democratic constitution makes no difference, that the difference between a democratic state form and the
      absolutist state form is only “empty, illusory, nil.” His answer is a vigorous <em class="calibre8" id="ch09--14">no.</em> The
      struggles arising out of social development have to be fought to their conclusion:
    </div>
<div class="bq" id="ch09--15">
      The best form of the state is that in which social antagonisms are not blurred, are not forcibly—hence only
      artificially, only illusorily—fettered. The best form of the state is that in which they come to a free fight and
      thereby to a solution.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch09--16"><a class="calibre14" id="ch09fn2"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch09fn2-r" id="ch09--18">2</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="indentt" id="ch09--19">
      Therefore the <em class="calibre8" id="ch09--20">N.R.Z.</em> group pushed for everything that would further a
      democratic-constitutional government, a complete democratization of the state. But increasingly a question mark
      had to be put over the issue: what social force could achieve this aim?
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch09--21">
      The answer was not worked out by meditation in the offices of the <em class="calibre8" id="ch09--22">N.R.Z.</em> It came in
      response to a series of shocks. In September a watershed event cast a bright light. An uprising broke out in the
      Frankfurt area, fought “by the workers of Frankfurt, Offenbach and Hanau, and by the peasants of the surrounding
      region,” Engels reported. The bourgeois elements opposed the movement, and it was suppressed by the government
      with the help of Prussian, Austrian, and Hessian troops. Engels’ article on the uprising looked at the class
      alignment and generalized: why the victories of the counterrevolution all over Europe?
    </div>
<div class="bq1" id="ch09--23">
      Because all sides know that the struggle that is looming in all civilized countries is an entirely different one,
      an infinitely more important one, than all previous revolutions: because in Vienna as in Paris, in Berlin as in
      Frankfurt, in London as in Milan, it is a question of the <em class="calibre8" id="ch09--24">overthrow of the political rule of
      the bourgeoisie</em>, of a transformation whose imminent consequences already fill all comfortable and puzzled
      citizens with dismay.
    </div>
<div class="bqi2" id="ch09--25">
      Is there any revolutionary center in the world where the red flag, the battle symbol of the fraternizing European
      proletariat, has not waved over the barricades in the last five months?
    </div>
<div class="bqi2" id="ch09--26">
<a class="calibre6" id="page_231"></a>In Frankfurt too, the parliament of the united Junkers and bourgeois was combated under the
      red flag.
    </div>
<div class="bqi2" id="ch09--28">
      It is because the bourgeoisie is threatened by every uprising breaking out now—threatened directly as to its
      political existence and indirectly as to its social existence: this is the reason for all these defeats. The
      mostly unarmed people have to fight not only against the forces of the organized bureaucratic and military state
      which have been taken over by the bourgeoisie, but also against the armed bourgeoisie itself. Confronting the
      unorganized and badly armed people stand the joint forces of the other classes of society, well organized and
      well equipped. And that is why the people have been beaten so far, and why they will continue to be beaten till
      their opponents are weakened—whether because the troops get involved in war or because they have an internal
      split—or until some big event drives the people into desperate struggle and demoralizes their opponents.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch09--29"><a class="calibre14" id="ch09fn3"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch09fn3-r" id="ch09--31">3</a></sup>

<div class="noindentt" id="ch09--32">
      Engels’ article then points to looming events in France as the hope of renewed revolutionary élan in Europe.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch09--33">
      At the end of August Marx, on a visit to Vienna, spoke before the Democratic Association there, and seems to have
      expressed an opinion about the Austrian situation that he had not yet applied to Germany. “Herr <em class="calibre8" id="ch09--34">Marx,”</em> said the Viennese press report, “opined it made no difference <em class="calibre8" id="ch09--35">who</em>
      was Minister, for now here too—as in Paris—it was a question of the struggle between the bourgeoisie and the

      By December the pattern was clear enough for the publication of Marx’s major programmatic article, “The
      Bourgeoisie and the Counterrevolution,” which (as we have seen) indicted the bourgeoisie forgoing over to the
      counterrevolution. It contains the most powerful flagellation yet of the bourgeoisie’s incapacity. A key passage,
      from the second part, is a good example of Marx’s “thunderer” style as well as of the political interpretation he
      is developing:
    </div>
<div class="bq1" id="ch09--40">
      The German bourgeoisie had developed so sluggishly, cravenly and slowly that at the moment when it menacingly
      confronted feudalism and absolutism, it saw itself menacingly faced by the proletariat and by all sections of the
      citizenry [<em class="calibre8" id="ch09--41">Bürgertum,</em> burghers; not bourgeois] whose interests and ideas were related to
      the proletariat. And it not only saw a class <em class="calibre8" id="ch09--42">behind</em> it but all of Europe hostilely arrayed
      <em class="calibre8" id="ch09--43">before</em> it. The Prussian bourgeoisie was not, as the French bourgeoisie of 1789 had been,
      the class that <a class="calibre6" id="page_232"></a>represented the <em class="calibre8" id="ch09--45">whole</em> of modern society vis-á-vis the
      representatives of the old society, the monarchy and the aristocracy. It had sunk down to a kind of <em class="calibre8" id="ch09--46">social estate</em> just as clearly distinct from the Crown as from the people, eager for opposition to
      both, irresolute before either taken individually, because it always saw both of them either before or behind;
      inclined from the outset to betray the people and to compromise with the crowned representative of the old
      society, because it itself already belonged to the old society; representing not the interests of a new society
      against an old one but newly revived interests inside an obsolescent society; at the helm of the revolution not
      because the people stood behind it but because the people pushed it on before; in the van not because it
      represented the initiative of a new era of society but only the rancor of an old one; a stratum that had not
      broken through under the old state but which now was heaved up to the surface of the new state by an earthquake;
      without faith in itself, without faith in the people, grumbling at those above, trembling at those below,
      egoistic toward both sides and conscious of its egoism, revolutionary vis-á-vis the conservatives, conservative
      vis-á-vis the revolutionaries, distrustful of its own catchwords, given to phrases instead of ideas, intimidated
      by the international storm, exploiting the international storm;—no energy in any direction, plagiarism in all
      directions; common because it was not original, original in its commonness;—haggling over its own aspirations,
      without initiative, without faith in itself, without faith in the people, without a world-historical mission;—a
      damned old codger who found himself condemned to lead and mislead the first youthful currents of a sturdy people
      into the channels of his own senile interests;—sans eyes, sans ears, sans teeth, sans everything;—in such wise
      did the <em class="calibre8" id="ch09--47">Prussian bourgeoisie</em> find itself at the helm of the Prussian state after the March

      Marx points to the class bloc we have already described: proletariat, <a class="calibre6" id="page_233"></a>petty-bourgeoisie,
      small peasantry. This time the peasantry is featured more prominently than before, for the government has just
      made clear, by its bill on the abolition of feudal burdens on the land, that it is impotent to attack feudal
      property on the land for fear of awakening ideas about bourgeois property. Bourgeois “egoism” has blinded it “to
      the point where it drove away its own <em class="calibre8" id="ch09--57">indispensable allies—</em>the class of <em class="calibre8" id="ch09--58">peasantry.”<a class="calibre16" id="ch09en1-r"></a><a class="nounder3" href="43.html#ch09en1" id="ch09--60">*</a></em>

      The French bourgeoisie began with the emancipation of the peasantry. With the peasants it conquered Europe. The
      Prussian bourgeoisie was so wrapped up in its own <em class="calibre8" id="ch09--62">narrow</em>, immediate interests that it even
      alienated this ally and made it a tool in the hands of the feudal counterrevolution.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch09--63"><a class="calibre14" id="ch09fn5"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch09fn5-r" id="ch09--65">5</a></sup>

      Conclusion:
    </div>
<div class="bq1" id="ch09--67">
      The history of the Prussian bourgeoisie, as in general that of the German bourgeoisie from March to December,
      proves that in Germany a purely <em class="calibre8" id="ch09--68">bourgeois revolution</em> and the establishment of <em class="calibre8" id="ch09--69">bourgeois rule</em> under the form of <em class="calibre8" id="ch09--70">constitutional monarchy</em> are impossible,

      This—counterrevolution or Social Republic—is an important new formulation of the revolutionary alternatives.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch09--76">
      As we have seen,<sup class="calibre13" id="ch09--77"><a class="calibre14" id="ch09fn7"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch09fn7-r" id="ch09--79">7</a></sup> the slogan of the Social Republic (or Social and Democratic Republic) was already
      in common use to indicate a democratic republic that takes social measures beyond the interests of the
      bourgeoisie. At the time, “social institutions” meant in a general way what we might now call “socialistic”
      institutions. For example, in the <em class="calibre8" id="ch09--80">N.R.Z.</em> for September 1, 1848, Engels wrote that
    </div>
<div class="bq" id="ch09--81">
      the democratic-social republic must first be proclaimed [in France], the French proletariat must first stand over
      its bourgeoisie with its foot on its neck, before the lasting victory of Democracy is thinkable in Italy,
      Germany, Poland, Hungary, etc.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch09--82"><a class="calibre14" id="ch09fn8"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch09fn8-r" id="ch09--84">8</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="noindentt" id="ch09--85">
      This is also the meaning of Marx’s counterposition, in his 1850 <em class="calibre8" id="ch09--86">Class Struggles in France</em>,
      of the “bourgeois republic” to the “republic with social institutions.” The republic that was actually set up by
      the Constituent Assembly in May was, says Marx, “not the republic with social institutions, not the vision that
      hovered before the fighters on the <a class="calibre6" id="page_234"></a>barricades.” It was “no revolutionary weapon against the
      bourgeois order, but rather … the political reconsolidation of bourgeois society, in a word, <em class="calibre8" id="ch09--88">a
      bourgeois republic</em>.” True, the government “was forced by the immediate pressure of the proletariat to
      announce it as a <em class="calibre8" id="ch09--89">republic with social institutions</em>” but in fact “the Paris proletariat was
      still incapable of going beyond the bourgeois republic otherwise than in its <em class="calibre8" id="ch09--90">fancy</em>

      Engels wrote later that “a <em class="calibre8" id="ch09--94">pure</em>, bourgeois republic in Germany was outstripped by events
      before it came into existence.”<sup class="calibre13" id="ch09--95"><a class="calibre14" id="ch09fn10"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch09fn10-r" id="ch09--97">10</a></sup>

<div class="indent" id="ch09--98">
      The slogan of the Social Republic remained a popularized and agitational (because open-ended) way of referring to
      a government that takes a socialistic direction, right up to the time of the First International and after.<a class="calibre6" id="ch09en2-r"></a><a class="nounder1" href="43.html#ch09en2" id="ch09--100">*</a> In 1848 it lent itself very well
      to designate the idea of the <em class="calibre8" id="ch09--101">transitional</em> regime which was no longer bourgeois but not
      yet Communist, based on a bloc of progressive classes.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch09--102">
      At the point we are at now (end of 1848), Marx’s concept of this bloc is broad indeed. How broad may be seen from
      the sentence that follows immediately after the above-quoted invocation of “the social-republican revolution”:
    </div>
<div class="bq1" id="ch09--103">
      But this itself must rearouse the viable part of the bourgeoisie out of its apathy; this is guaranteed us above

      Clearly Marx is hoping that at least a more progressive section (“viable part”) of the bourgeoisie itself will
      decide that, for them, the Social Republic is a lesser evil to absolutist counterrevolution, and therefore go
      along willingly with a regime based on the broad bloc of classes lying to the left of the main mass of the
      bourgeoisie.

<div class="indent" id="ch09--111">
      The following month, January 1849, posed the problem on the plane of immediate tactics. An election—based on a
      two-stage and quite undemocratic electoral system with a restricted franchise—was scheduled in Prussia for the
      22nd. Should the Workers Association run its own candidates, on the platform of the Social Republic, against the
      “plain Democrats” who, as advocates of a bourgeois republic, were also enemies of the old regime?
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch09--112">
      This led to the last phase of Marx’s persistent attempt to support the bourgeois opposition against absolutism.
      His statement of policy was paraphrased as follows in the report in the Workers Association organ on the
      Executive’s discussion:
    </div>
<div class="bq" id="ch09--113">
      … at the moment it is not a question of doing something along the lines of our principles but of putting up
      opposition to the government, absolutism and feudal rule; sufficient for this, however, are plain
      Democrats—so-called liberals—who are likewise not satisfied by a long shot with the present regime. One must take
      the situation as it is for once. Since the important thing now is to put up the strongest possible opposition to
      the existing absolutist system, then, if it is understood that the principles we ourselves hold cannot be put
      across in the elections, good sense requires us to unite with another party which likewise is putting up
      opposition, in order not to let our common enemy, the absolute monarchy, win.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch09--114"><a class="calibre14" id="ch09fn13"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch09fn13-r" id="ch09--116">13</a></sup>

      constitution “octroyed” (handed down) by the Prussian king.

<div class="indent" id="ch09--118">
      On the basis of experience Marx was later going to dispute the simple “good sense” of this policy. In any case,
      this was not a question of choosing between good bourgeois candidates and bad ones, but rather of choosing
      between supporters of two different social systems, one progressive and the other historically reactionary.<a class="calibre6" id="ch09en3-r"></a><a class="nounder1" href="43.html#ch09en3" id="ch09--120">*</a>

<a class="calibre6" id="page_236"></a>On the eve of the election a two-part article by Marx went all-out in an appeal not only to
      the Democracy but especially to the bourgeois opposition to defeat absolutism, and in particular to defeat the
      octroyed constitution. It deserves notice as a milestone in Marx’s political development, for never again will he
      invest such expectations in the bourgeoisie.

<div class="indent" id="ch09--123">
      Cologne’s leading paper, the <em class="calibre8" id="ch09--124">Kolnische Zeitung,</em> had charged that the opponents of the
      octroyed constitution were proponents of a red republic; it was necessary to broaden opposition to the
      constitution if this scare propaganda were to be countered. Marx answered: that is not the issue—not a red
      republic or any republic. The only issue is this:
    </div>
<div class="bq1" id="ch09--125">
      Do you want the old <em class="calibre8" id="ch09--126">absolutism</em> together with a newly refurbished estates system—or do you
      want a bourgeois <em class="calibre8" id="ch09--127">representative system?</em> … it is not at all a question of a struggle
      against bourgeois property relations, such as is taking place in France and is under preparation in England. It
      is rather a question of a struggle against a political constitution which endangers “<em class="calibre8" id="ch09--128">bourgeois</em> property relations,” by surrendering the helm of state to the representatives of the

</div>
<div class="noindentt" id="ch09--133">
      The main appeal of the article is systematically pitched in terms of the interests of the bourgeoisie itself:

      your class, thrusts the whole nation back into medieval barbarism!<sup class="calibre13" id="ch09--152"><a class="calibre14" id="ch09fn19"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch09fn19-r" id="ch09--154">19</a></sup>

      If the Crown’s constitution is against the class interests of the Prussian bourgeoisie, why is this bourgeoisie
      in favor of it? Marx’s first answer:
    </div>
<div class="bq1" id="ch09--156">
      The commercial and industrial sector of the bourgeoisie throws itself into the arms of the counterrevolution out
      of fear of the revolution. As though the counterrevolution were anything else than the overture to revolution.
    </div>
<div class="noindentt" id="ch09--157">
      His appeal to the bourgeoisie, then, is: restoration of the absolutist power will make a revolution more certain,
      not less. (The bourgeoisie was not convinced, with good reason.) Next, Marx points to that sector of the
      bourgeoisie “which, indifferent to the collective interests of its class, pursues a special interest of its own,
      a separate interest which is even hostile to the others.”<sup class="calibre13" id="ch09--158"><a class="calibre14" id="ch09fn20"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch09fn20-r" id="ch09--160">20</a></sup> This sector includes “the financial barons, the
      public creditors, bankers and rentiers” plus government-business contractors and their intellectual and
      professional hangers-on. But these cannot account for the bourgeoisie as a whole.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch09--161">
      The election results showed that, while in the Rhineland the Democratic candidates nosed out the opposition, in
      Prussia as a whole the bourgeoisie continued moving right. The end of the line was near.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch09--162">
      In mid-February Marx put all this behind him, though without backtracking:
    </div>
<div class="bq1" id="ch09--163">
      We like firm attitudes. We have never flirted with a parliamentary party.<a class="calibre6" id="ch09en4-r"></a><a class="nounder1" href="43.html#ch09en4" id="ch09--165">*</a> The party that <em class="calibre8" id="ch09--166">we</em> represent, the party of the
      people, exists in Germany only in elementary form. But where it is a struggle against the <em class="calibre8" id="ch09--167">existing government</em>, we ally ourselves even with our enemies. We take as a fact the official
      Prussian opposition, just as it emerges out of the miserable German cultural conditions obtaining to the present
      day, and hence we have allowed <em class="calibre8" id="ch09--168">our</em> own views to stay in the background during the
      electoral struggle. Now, <em class="calibre8" id="ch09--169">after</em> the election, we again affirm our old relentless
      standpoint not only as against the government but also as against the official opposition.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch09--170"><a class="calibre14" id="ch09fn22"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch09fn22-r" id="ch09--172">22</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="indentt" id="ch09--173">
<a class="calibre6" id="page_238"></a>From here on, Marx moved more and more away from participation in the Democratic movement as
      such, toward emphasis on the primacy of the workers’ organizations and toward mobilization of the peasantry of
      the region. On April 14 the break was made definitive: Marx and three close collaborators announced their
      resignation from the Rhineland committee of the Democratic Association, and publicly stated that the objective
      should be the organization of workers’ associations instead.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch09--175"><a class="calibre14" id="ch09fn23"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch09fn23-r" id="ch09--177">23</a></sup> Thus Marx returned the goal of workers’ class
      organization to the top of the agenda, as explained at the end of Special Note J. However, the project for a
      national congress of workers’ associations died, as the revolution itself was repressed throughout the country in
      the next period.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch09--178">
      This resignation marked the formal end of a period of experimentation in Marx’s theory of revolution and in his
      practice.
    </div>
<h3 class="h2" id="ch09lev4">4. SECOND VERSION
    <br class="calibre18" id="ch09--180"/>
    OF PERMANENT REVOLUTION</h3>
<div class="indent" id="ch09--181">
      The line that Marx pursued in the Prussian election of January 1849 had served to keep alive the initial version
      of the permanent revolution concept. But if we follow the line from his December article on “The Bourgeoisie and
      the Counterrevolution” to his resignation from the Democratic Association committee in April, we can distinguish
      a second version of permanent revolution to which he moved.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch09--182">
      The first version had envisaged the following uninterrupted stages: (1) the bourgeoisie takes political power
      from absolutism; (2) the Democracy, as a bloc of proletariat, petty-bourgeoisie, and peasantry, moves in to take
      over from the bourgeoisie.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch09--183">
      The second version involves a simple change: since the bourgeoisie refuses to take political power, the Democracy
      must strive to capture political power directly for itself. What remains unchanged is this: the perspective is
      still to accelerate bourgeois economic development (modernization and industrialization) under the aegis of the
      new revolutionary power to the point where the next stage—proletarian power—goes onto the order of the day. The
      bourgeois-democratic stage is to be telescoped under a political power which is not that of the bourgeoisie
      itself. (Looking ahead, we can see an analogy: under Bonapartism the <a class="calibre6" id="page_239"></a>bourgeois stage is also
      going to be carried out under a political power which is not that of the bourgeoisie itself.)<a class="calibre6" id="ch09en5-r"></a><a class="nounder1" href="43.html#ch09en5" id="ch09--186">*</a>
</div>
<div class="indent" id="ch09--187">
      This does not involve the illusion that communism itself is on the immediate social agenda for backward Germany,
      but it does involve skipping the stage of the “pure,” or bourgeois, republic and going over directly to the
      Social Republic. It also pushes to the fore the slogan of a second revolution.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch09--188">
      To be sure, an article had already referred to the second revolution during the very first month of the <em class="calibre8" id="ch09--189">N.R.Z</em>.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch09--190"><a class="calibre14" id="ch09fn26"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch09fn26-r" id="ch09--192">26</a></sup> Now it was more pressing. Marx used a well-publicized occasion to give it
      prominence—his defense speech before a Cologne jury in February, which ends as follows:
    </div>
<div class="bq1" id="ch09--193">
      In conclusion, I repeat that only the first act of the drama has been concluded. The struggle of the two
      societies, medieval society and bourgeois society, will be carried on anew in political forms….
    </div>
<div class="bqi2" id="ch09--194">
      But whatever the road the new National Assembly may take, the necessary result can be nothing else than this:
      <em class="calibre8" id="ch09--195">complete victory of the counterrevolution</em> or <em class="calibre8" id="ch09--196">a new victorious
      revolution!</em> Perhaps the victory of the revolution is possible only after the counterrevolution has been
      consummated.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch09--197"><a class="calibre14" id="ch09fn27"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch09fn27-r" id="ch09--199">27</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="noindentt" id="ch09--200">
      The last sentence, qualified with a “perhaps,” writes off the bourgeoisie as a revolutionary force, this time for
      good.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch09--201">
      The aim of a democratic constitution as the goal of the struggle was not at all affected. Right after the
      first-stage election, Marx returned to <a class="calibre6" id="page_240"></a>the charge against the octroyed constitution with
      heavy emphasis on the Democratic class lineup:
    </div>
<div class="bq1" id="ch09--203">
      Can the petty-bourgeois and peasants, and the proletarians in addition, find a better state form for the
      representation of their interests than the democratic republic? Aren’t these precisely the classes that are the
      most radical and the most democratic in the whole society? Isn’t the proletariat precisely the specifically
      <em class="calibre8" id="ch09--204">red</em> class?<sup class="calibre13" id="ch09--205"><a class="calibre14" id="ch09fn28"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch09fn28-r" id="ch09--207">28</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="indentt" id="ch09--208">
      As a matter of fact, the last phase of the German revolution acted this out. In May, what Engels later wrote up
      as “The German Campaign for the Reich Constitution” broke out with armed uprisings in the Rhineland and South
      Germany; on the 16th the Prussian government presented Marx with an expulsion order; on the 19th the <em class="calibre8" id="ch09--209">N.R.Z.</em> appeared for the last time, in a special red-ink issue, in which the editors said of
      themselves: “Their last word everywhere and always will be: <em class="calibre8" id="ch09--210">Emancipation of the laboring
      class!</em>”<sup class="calibre13" id="ch09--211"><a class="calibre14" id="ch09fn29"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch09fn29-r" id="ch09--213">29</a></sup> Engels went to fight with the insurrectionary forces.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch09--214">
      Engels’ essay on this last flare-up of the revolution, written soon afterwards, summarized the class lineup as
      follows, thereby also explaining the movement’s hapless futility:
    </div>
<div class="bq1" id="ch09--215">
      The soul of the whole movement was the class of the <em class="calibre8" id="ch09--216">small bourgeoisie</em>, called by
      preference the <em class="calibre8" id="ch09--217">middle class [Bürgerstand</em>], and this indeed is the predominating class in
      Germany, especially in the South….
    </div>
<div class="bqi2" id="ch09--218">
      Behind the small bourgeoisie everywhere, however, stand other classes, which take up the movement … give it a
      more definite and energetic character, and wherever possible try to take it over: the <em class="calibre8" id="ch09--219">proletariat</em> and a large part of the <em class="calibre8" id="ch09--220">peasants,</em> which the advanced section
      of the petty-bourgeoisie generally joined for a while, in addition.
    </div>
<div class="bqi2" id="ch09--221">
      These classes, with the proletariat of the larger towns at the head, took the solemnly affirmed assurances of
      support for the Constitution more seriously than the petty-bourgeois agitators liked…. [Everyone understood] that
      after victory the petty-bourgeoisie would have to defend this same constitution against these very same
      proletarians and peasants. These classes pushed the small bourgeoisie to an open break with the existing state
      power.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch09--222"><a class="calibre14" id="ch09fn30"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch09fn30-r" id="ch09--224">30</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="noindentt" id="ch09--225">
      The “viable” or “progressive” sector of the bourgeoisie (recall the <a class="calibre6" id="page_241"></a>expectation in Marx’s
      “The Bourgeoisie and the Counterrevolution”) was around too—if only “at the beginning of the movement”:
    </div>
<div class="bq1" id="ch09--227">
      Besides, at the beginning of the movement, the more resolute section of the big and middle bourgeoisie likewise
      joined with the petty-bourgeoisie, just as we see in all previous petty-bourgeois movements in England and
      France. The bourgeoisie never rules as a whole; leaving aside the feudal castes that have still retained some
      part of their political power, even the big bourgeoisie, as soon as it has defeated feudalism, splits into a
      governing party and an opposition party, which are usually represented on the one hand by the bank and on the
      other by the manufacturers. The oppositionist, progressive section of the big and middle bourgeoisie then has
      common interests with the petty-bourgeoisie as against the ruling section, and it unites with the
      petty-bourgeoisie for a common struggle.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch09--228"><a class="calibre14" id="ch09fn31"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch09fn31-r" id="ch09--230">31</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="indentt" id="ch09--231">
      The right wing of the movement was fighting for national unification under the Black-Red-Gold constitution of the
      Reich; the Democratic left wing fought for a “red republic” (Social Republic). But the revolution never got a
      chance to become permanent, that is, to start the expected class shifts toward the left as a result of the defeat
      of the old regime; for the Democratic uprising was suppressed.
    </div>
<h3 class="h2" id="ch09lev5">5. THE INTERNATIONAL MEANING OF PERMANENT REVOLUTION</h3>
<div class="indent" id="ch09--233">
      Marx had never expected the movement to win in backward Germany alone, if confined to German forces only. He
      looked on Germany as one battlefield in a European war (the revolution), and usually a secondary one at that.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch09--234">
      This adds another dimension to the concept of permanent revolution; for it views the course of the revolution on
      a European-wide scale, proceeding “in permanence” (in ongoing waves) from one country to another. There are two
      aspects to this country-to-country interaction: the role of the more advanced (more industrialized) countries in
      relation to others where the bourgeoisie had not yet won political power; and the role of oppressor countries in
      relation to oppressed nationalities.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch09--235">
      To be sure, this internationalism of the revolution had been a part of <a class="calibre6" id="page_242"></a>Marx’s thinking from
      the outset; the best-known early expression in Marx is the last sentence of his introduction to a critique of
      Hegel in 1844: “When all the inner conditions are fulfilled, the <em class="calibre8" id="ch09--237">German resurrection day</em>
      will be announced by the <em class="calibre8" id="ch09--238">crowing of the Gallic cock</em>.”<sup class="calibre13" id="ch09--239"><a class="calibre14" id="ch09fn32"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch09fn32-r" id="ch09--241">32</a></sup> (He kept on expressing
      this very opinion through 1848.) More important, this international perspective became a basic ingredient of
      permanent revolution especially through the experience of 1848-1849. Here too, the origin of the term <em class="calibre8" id="ch09--242">permanent revolution</em> in the French Revolution played a conditioning role. We may recall Marx’s
      early remark that Napoleon had substituted “permanent war for permanent revolution.”<sup class="calibre13" id="ch09--243"><a class="calibre14" id="ch09en6-r"></a><a class="nounder2" href="43.html#ch09en6" id="ch09--245">*</a></sup> The historical significance
      of the Napoleonic wars was that they spread the bourgeois revolution to other parts of Europe, that is, they made
      the revolution “permanent” (ongoing) on an international scale even while limiting the revolution at home. The
      elements of European war and European revolution were inextricably mingled.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch09--246">
      Even more than in Napoleonic days, the revolution of 1848-1849 presented the spectacle of the <em class="calibre8" id="ch09--247">contagious revolution</em>, flaring up in ongoing waves in one country after another, with an
      interacting impact. For the first time on such a big scale, internationalism was not merely an aspiration, a
      “moral value,” a daydream, or a philosophic notion, but a practical, matter-of-fact social force.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch09--248">
      It was also the answer in terms of political theory to the impossibilities of the German revolution. Could one
      really believe that this backward country, with its small proletariat, petty-bourgeois Democracy, timid
      bourgeoisie, under an overbearing bureaucratic state, could carry through the permanent revolution even as far as
      a Social Republic? Not on the basis of German forces, thought Marx.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch09--249">
      The article in which Marx laid out this line of thought in systematic form appeared in the <em class="calibre8" id="ch09--250">N.R.Z.</em> at the beginning of the new year, 1849. It has sometimes been misinterpreted through
      failure to understand that in it “world war” means <em class="calibre8" id="ch09--251">revolutionary war on a world-wide
      scale</em>, on the analogy of the Napoleonic “permanent revolution.”<sup class="calibre13" id="ch09--252"><a class="calibre14" id="ch09en7-r"></a><a class="nounder2" href="43.html#ch09en7" id="ch09--254">**</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="indent" id="ch09--255">
      The article begins for contrast, with the elocutionary declamations <a class="calibre6" id="page_243"></a>with which the leaders
      of Europe acknowledged the internationalism of the revolution: “The pope consecrated it ritually; Lamartine’s
      Aeolian harp quavered weakly with tinkling philanthropic airs, set to words about <em class="calibre8" id="ch09--257">fratemité,</em> the brotherhood of social sectors and nations,” and so on.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch09--258"><a class="calibre14" id="ch09fn34"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch09fn34-r" id="ch09--260">34</a></sup> Marx’s internationalist
      thesis is presented in the last section of the article:
    </div>
<div class="bq1" id="ch09--261">
      The defeat of the working class in France [in June] and the victory of the French bourgeoisie meant at the same
      time that the nationalities that had responded to the crowing of the Gallic cock [the February, revolution in
      Paris] with heroic strivings for liberation were again stifled. Poland,<sup class="calibre13" id="ch09--262"><a class="calibre14" id="ch09en8-r"></a><a class="nounder2" href="43.html#ch09en8" id="ch09--264">*</a></sup> Italy and Ireland were once
      again ravaged, despoiled and massacred by Prussian, Austrian and English myrmidons. The defeat of the working
      class in France and the victory of the French bourgeoisie was at the same time the defeat of the middle classes
      in all European countries where the middle classes, temporarily united with the people, had responded to the
      crowing of the Gallic cock with a bloody insurrection against feudalism. Naples, Vienna, Berlin! The defeat of
      the working class in France and the victory of the French bourgeoisie was at the same time the victory of the
      East over the West, the defeat of civilization by barbarism. In Walachia began the suppression of the Romanians
      by the Russians and their tools, the Turks; in Vienna, the Croats, pandours, Czechs, Jellachich’s redcoats, and
      similar riffraff strangled German freedom, and at the same time the czar is omnipresent in Europe. The overthrow
      of the bourgeoisie in France, the triumph of the French working class and the emancipation of the working class
      in general—this is therefore the battlecry of European liberation.
    </div>
<div class="noindentt" id="ch09--265">
      But it was on England that the revolutionary wave broke:
    </div>
<div class="bq" id="ch09--266">
      England rules the world market. A transformation of the relations of political economy in every land of the
      European continent, on the whole of the European continent, is a tempest in a teapot without England. The
      relations of industry and commerce inside every country are ruled by their intercourse with other countries, and
      are conditioned by their relation on the world market. But <a class="calibre6" id="page_244"></a>England rules the world market,
      and the bourgeoisie rules England.
    </div>
<div class="bqi2" id="ch09--268">
      The liberation of Europe, whether in an uprising by the oppressed nationalities for independence or the overthrow
      of feudal absolutism, is therefore conditioned on a victorious uprising of the French working class. But every
      social upheaval in France is necessarily wrecked on the rock of the English bourgeoisie, of the industrial and
      commercial world domination by Great Britain. Every partial social reform in France, and on the European
      continent in general, is and remains an empty pious wish insofar as it aspires to end there [without involving
      England].
    </div>
<div class="noindentt" id="ch09--269">
      What then can be the positive outcome? Marx’s analysis continues:
    </div>
<div class="bq" id="ch09--270">
      And old England will be overthrown only by a <em class="calibre8" id="ch09--271">world war,</em> which alone can offer the
      Chartist party, the organized English workers’ party, the conditions for a successful uprising against its giant
      oppressor. The Chartists at the head of the English government: only at this point does the social revolution
      leave the realm of utopia for the realm of reality. But every <em class="calibre8" id="ch09--272">European war</em> in which
      England is involved is a world war. It will be carried on in Canada as well as in Italy, in the East Indies as
      well as in Prussia, in Africa as well as on the Danube. And European war will be the first consequence of a
      victorious workers’ revolution in France. As in Napoleon’s day, England will be in the van of the
      counterrevolutionary armies, but through the war itself it will be hurled forward to the van of the revolutionary
      movement [given the victory of Chartism] and will expiate its crime against the revolution of the eighteenth
      century.
    </div>
<div class="bqi2" id="ch09--273">
<em class="calibre8" id="ch09--274">Revolutionary uprising of the French working class, world war:</em> this is the agenda for the

</div>
<div class="indentt" id="ch09--278">
      England’s importance for the international scale of the revolution had also been eagerly asserted by Engels back
      in April 1848, when he wrote of his certainty that the Chartists would take power in two months.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch09--279"><a class="calibre14" id="ch09fn37"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch09fn37-r" id="ch09--281">37</a></sup> But
      these statements should not be regarded primarily as predictions-the expression of high confidence is always
      expected while a struggle is in progress—but as analyses of the conditions under which the European convulsion
      could have a positive revolutionary outcome.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch09--282">
      Marx’s insight into the international meaning of permanent revolution was embodied several times in his <em class="calibre8" id="ch09--283">Class Struggles in France</em> in 1850. It applied to France as well as to backward Germany. Taking
      it a <a class="calibre6" id="page_245"></a>little ahead of order, let us see how Marx stressed it in this work, in hindsight:
    </div>
<div class="bq" id="ch09--285">
      Just as the workers thought [after the February revolution] they would be able to emancipate themselves side by
      side with the bourgeoisie, so they thought they would be able to consummate a proletarian revolution within the
      national walls of France, side by side with the remaining bourgeois nations. But French relations of production
      are conditioned by the foreign trade of France, by her position on the world market and the laws thereof; how was
      France to break them without a European revolutionary war, which would strike back at the despot of the world
      market, England?<sup class="calibre13" id="ch09--286"><a class="calibre14" id="ch09fn38"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch09fn38-r" id="ch09--288">38</a></sup>

<a class="calibre6" id="page_246"></a>It was only this international standpoint that provided a realistic political basis for
      Marx’s concept of permanent revolution.

<div class="indent" id="ch09--310">
      There was also a politico-military side that deserves notice. It was, naturally, Engels who took it up. In the
      late spring of 1849, he wrote in 1876,
    </div>
<div class="bq" id="ch09--311">
      All could still have been won if the [Frankfurt] parliament and the leaders of the South German movement had only
      had courage and resolution. A parliamentary decree calling the Baden and Palatinate army to the defense of the
      Assembly would have sufficed. The Assembly with one blow would have thereby won back the confidence of the
      people. The defection of the Hesse-Darmstadt troops and the adhesion of Württemberg and Bavaria to the movement
      could then be expected with assurance; the small states of middle Germany would likewise have been drawn in;
      Prussia would have had its hands full at home, and in the face of so powerful a movement in Germany, Russia would
      have been forced to pull back its troops in Poland, troops which thereafter were effectively used in Hungary.
      Hungary could therefore have been saved in Frankfurt; and besides there was a present probability that, given a
      victoriously advancing revolution in Germany, the daily expected eruption in Paris would not have ended up with
      the defeat without a struggle that was the fate of the radical petty-bourgeois on June 13, 1849.
    </div>
<div class="bqi2" id="ch09--312">
      The chances were as favorable as could be. The advice to call on the Baden-Palatinate forces was given in
      Frankfurt by all of us [of the <em class="calibre8" id="ch09--313">N.R.Z.</em> group]; the advice to march on Frankfurt without
      any call was given in Mannheim [Baden] by Marx and myself. But neither the Baden leaders nor the Frankfurt
      parliamentarians had the courage, energy, understanding or initiative.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch09--314"><a class="calibre14" id="ch09fn42"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch09fn42-r" id="ch09--316">42</a></sup>

<div class="noindentt" id="ch09--317">
      The first sentence quoted above may be viewed as an example of Engels’ tendency to “be swayed a little too much
      by the military aspect of things” at times (as Marx had occasion to caution him).<sup class="calibre13" id="ch09--318"><a class="calibre14" id="ch09fn43"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch09fn43-r" id="ch09--320">43</a></sup> The sociopolitical
      imperatives were stronger than anyone’s “courage and resolution,” and were primary in the permanent revolution
      pattern. But within this framework, the military reverberations of revolutionary action could also be a political
      force.

<div class="indent" id="ch09--323">
      The drive of events soon made the second version of permanent revolution as untenable as the first. By April 1849
      at least, Marx no longer believed that the leading elements of the Democracy could make a revolution any more
      than could the bourgeoisie proper. It was in this month that he resigned from the leadership of the Democratic
      Association, as we have seen, and it was also in this month that he began publishing <em class="calibre8" id="ch09--324">Wage-Labor and Capital</em> in his paper.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch09--325">
      Although we now read <em class="calibre8" id="ch09--326">Wage-Labor and Capital</em> only as a work on political economy, it was
      introduced to the readers of the <em class="calibre8" id="ch09--327">N.R.Z.</em> with the first formal announcement of a political
      turn. Marx set down a new thesis: direct counterposition of <em class="calibre8" id="ch09--328">proletarian</em> revolution to
      absolutism.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch09--329">
      Current history, he writes, has proved that the subjugation of the working class in the course of the revolution
      simultaneously meant the defeat (by absolutism) of its class opponents, “the bourgeois republicans in France and
      the bourgeois and peasant classes which were fighting feudal absolutism throughout the continent of Europe.”
    </div>
<div class="bq" id="ch09--330">
      The June struggle in Paris, the fall of Vienna, the tragicomedy of Berlin’s November 1848, the desperate
      exertions of Poland, Italy and Hungary, the starving of Ireland into submission—these were the chief factors
      which characterized the European class struggle between bourgeoisie and working class and by means of which we
      proved that every revolutionary upheaval, however remote from the class struggle its goal may appear to be, must
      fail until the revolutionary working class is victorious, that every social reform [that is, reformation] remains
      a utopia until the proletarian revolution and the feudalistic counterrevolution measure swords in a <em class="calibre8" id="ch09--331">world war</em>.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch09--332"><a class="calibre14" id="ch09fn44"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch09fn44-r" id="ch09--334">44</a></sup>

<div class="noindentt" id="ch09--335">
      This is a momentous conclusion for Marx to come to. The alternatives are no longer Social Republic or
      counterrevolution; the elastic formula of the Social Republic is replaced outright by the proletarian revolution.

<div class="indent" id="ch09--336">
      Along the same lines, a month later, Engels advises the German workers not to allow themselves to be used to
      “pull the chestnuts out of the fire” for the bourgeoisie and its ministry.

<div class="bq" id="ch09--337">
      The question is posed whether they are willing to be used for this purpose at a time when in the whole of Germany
      <em class="calibre8" id="ch09--338">civil war</em> stands <a class="calibre6" id="page_248"></a>at the door and when perhaps there will soon be
      occasion for them <em class="calibre8" id="ch09--340">to come forward with their own demands</em>.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch09--341"><a class="calibre14" id="ch09fn45"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch09fn45-r" id="ch09--343">45</a></sup>

<div class="indentt" id="ch09--344">
      In his account of “The German Campaign for the Reich Constitution” written more than a year later, Engels
      concludes with a review of the three class patterns. The turn that Marx had announced in April had been verified
      by the course of the armed campaign: this is what Engels explains.
    </div>
<div class="bq1" id="ch09--345">
      The campaign for the Reich constitution was wrecked by its own halfway character and inner <em class="calibre8" id="ch09--346">misere.</em> Ever since the defeat of June 1848, the question before the civilized part of the
      European continent was posed as follows: either the rule of the revolutionary proletariat or the rule of the
      classes that held sway before February. No halfway house is possible any longer. Especially in Germany has the
      bourgeoisie shown itself incapable of ruling; it could maintain its rule over the people only by turning the
      rulership back to the nobility and the bureaucracy. The petty-bourgeoisie, in alliance with the German ideology,
      sought through the Reich constitution to arrive at an impossible equilibrium of forces, which they hoped would
      postpone the decisive conflict. The attempt had to fail: those who were serious about the movement were not
      serious about the constitution, and those who were serious about the constitution were not serious about the
      movement.
    </div>
<div class="bqi2" id="ch09--347">
      But for all that, the campaign for the Reich constitution had important results nonetheless. Above all, it
      simplified the situation. It cut off an endless series of conciliation attempts; now that it has lost, victory
      can go only to the somewhat constitutionalized feudal-bureaucratic monarchy or else to the real revolution. And
      the revolution in Germany can no longer come to a conclusion other than with the complete rule of the
      proletariat.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch09--348"><a class="calibre14" id="ch09fn46"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch09fn46-r" id="ch09--350">46</a></sup>

      The third, and final, form of permanent revolution, then, affirms that the political revolution against the old
      power can be made not by the liberal bourgeoisie, not by the petty-bourgeois Democracy, but only under the
      hegemony of the proletariat—not the weak German proletariat by itself but as a part of the European proletarian
      revolution. The opportunity for the proletariat to play this final role would come as an ongoing revolution
      shifted to the left, from domination by the bourgeoisie <a class="calibre6" id="page_249"></a>to the ascendancy of the
      petty-bourgeois left. As Engels summarized it later, referring to the <em class="calibre8" id="ch09--353">N.R.Z.</em> group in
      1849:
