<div class="indent" id="ch15--2">
      There is another class or class stratum that plays a significant part in the politics of revolution and requires
      special discussion: a class with no name. At any rate, it has no established name except one devised by Marx
      half-fortuitously and before he had himself begun to understand its nature; and this name has given rise to
      endless misunderstanding and mistranslation. This is the so-called <em class="calibre8" id="ch15--3">lumpenproletariat.</em><a class="calibre6" id="ch15en1-r"></a><a class="nounder1" href="43.html#ch15en1" id="ch15--5">*</a>

<h3 class="h2" id="ch15lev1">1. GENESIS OF THE LUMPENPROLETARIAT</h3>
<div class="indent" id="ch15--7">
      The first problem about this class is: <em class="calibre8" id="ch15--8">what is it?</em>
</div>
<div class="indent" id="ch15--9">
      Marx did not work this out until 1852, by which time he made this much clear: the label did <em class="calibre8" id="ch15--10">not</em> mean any sector of the modern proletariat; it did not mean unemployed workers, or pauperized
      workers, or indeed any kind of genuine workers at all. The initial confusion, however, was not due to unfortunate
      terminology. There was a tangled and blurred historical period that needed to be understood first: the period in
      which the elements of the modern proletariat came into existence and took shape.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch15--11">
      We saw in Volume 1 that the term <em class="calibre8" id="ch15--12">proletariat</em> itself arose trailing clouds of confusion,
      and for the same reason.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch15--13"><a class="calibre14" id="ch15fn1"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch15fn1-r" id="ch15--15">1</a></sup> It took on its modern meaning (wage-workers) in the couple of decades before the
      <em class="calibre8" id="ch15--16">Communist Manifesto</em>, but did not lose its old meaning immediately. This coexisting older
      meaning was, for centuries, the “rabble” that lived in poverty from hand to mouth, the lowest stratum of
      propertyless <a class="calibre6" id="page_454"></a>freemen, the depressed plebeian mass; the name did not necessarily imply a
      working status of any kind. In this long-established usage, the “proletariat” comprised not only workers of
      various sorts but also an amorphous mass of adventitious, unsettled, irregular, and disreputable elements,
      including itinerant workers and vagrants shading into malefactors—like the Roman <em class="calibre8" id="ch15--18">proletarii.</em> There was a basic distinction between this gray mass and the modern working class,
      which Marx later put into these words: “The Roman proletariat lived at the expense of society, while modern
      society lives at the expense of the proletariat.”<sup class="calibre13" id="ch15--19"><a class="calibre14" id="ch15fn2"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch15fn2-r" id="ch15--21">2</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="indent" id="ch15--22">
      It is this Roman precedent that is the subject when the word <em class="calibre8" id="ch15--23">lumpenproletariat</em> occurs in
      <em class="calibre8" id="ch15--24">The German Ideology</em> some time in 1845: “The [Roman] plebeians, midway between freemen and
      slaves, never succeeded in becoming more than a lumpenproletariat.”<sup class="calibre13" id="ch15--25"><a class="calibre14" id="ch15fn3"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch15fn3-r" id="ch15--27">3</a></sup> But in the same work Marx
      shows that he is already quite aware of the historical importance of the <em class="calibre8" id="ch15--28">Lumpen</em> “who have
      existed in every epoch and whose existence <em class="calibre8" id="ch15--29">on a mass scale</em> after the decline of the Middle
      Ages preceded the mass formation of the ordinary proletariat…”<sup class="calibre13" id="ch15--30"><a class="calibre14" id="ch15fn4"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch15fn4-r" id="ch15--32">4</a></sup> And in the next paragraph, this social formation is
      called a lumpenproletariat. This word, evidently coined for the nonce, is written down as a description, not as a
      sociological term.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch15--33">
      This proto-class, this lumpen-plebs, was a big constituent of the lowest stratum of urban society during the
      transitional centuries, without any clear line between producing elements and nonproducing or purely parasitic
      elements. A lumpen-class of some kind has accompanied different social systems; it reached new proportions out of
      the decay of European feudalism.<a class="calibre6" id="ch15en2-r"></a><a class="nounder1" href="43.html#ch15en2" id="ch15--35">*</a> Of the plebeian opposition in the towns at the time of the German Peasant War in the
      sixteenth century, Engels wrote that it consisted of “ruined burghers,” journeymen and day-laborers and other
      townspeople without civic rights, and also:
    </div>
<div class="noindent" id="ch15--36">
<a class="calibre6" id="page_455"></a>the numerous precursors of the lumpenproletariat, who may be found even in the lowest stages
      of urban development. The lumpenproletariat is, generally speaking, a phenomenon evident in a more or less
      developed form in all the phases of society to date. The number of people without a definite occupation and a
      stable domicile increased greatly at that particular time, due to the decay of feudalism in a society in which
      every occupation, every sphere of life, was still fenced off by countless privileges. The number of vagabonds in
      all the developed countries was never so great as in the first half of the sixteenth century. In wartime some of
      these tramps joined the armies, others begged their way across the countryside, and others still eked out a
      meager living in the towns as day-laborers or whatever else was not under guild jurisdiction. All three groups
      played a part in the Peasant War; the first in the armies of princes, which overpowered the peasants; the second
      in the peasant conspiracies and peasant troops, where its demoralizing influence was evident at all times; and
      the third in the clashes of the urban parties. It must be recalled, however, that a great many of them, namely
      those living in the towns, still had a substantial element of sound peasant nature, and had not as yet been
      possessed by the venality and depravity of the present-day civilized lumpenproletariat.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch15--38">
      Plainly, the plebeian opposition in the towns of that day was of a mixed nature. It combined the depraved
      elements of the old feudal and guild society with the undeveloped, budding proletarian elements of the dawning,
      modern bourgeois society.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch15--39"><a class="calibre14" id="ch15fn7"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch15fn7-r" id="ch15--41">7</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="noindentt" id="ch15--42">
      Considerably later, Engels painted much the same picture in a criticism of Kautsky’s book <em class="calibre8" id="ch15--43">Communism in Central Germany in the Time of the Reformation.</em> One deficiency, he wrote the author,
      was:
    </div>
<div class="bq" id="ch15--44">
      Very defective inquiry into the development and role of the declassed, almost pariah-like elements standing
      almost wholly outside the feudal structure which inevitably had to spring up <a class="calibre6" id="page_456"></a>every time a
      town was formed, and which constituted the lowest stratum of every town population in the Middle Ages, without
      any rights, detached from the <em class="calibre8" id="ch15--46">Markgenossenschaft</em> [village community], from feudal
      dependency and from the guild corporation. This is difficult, but it is the <em class="calibre8" id="ch15--47">main basis;</em>
      for gradually, with the dissolution of feudal ties, this [stratum] becomes the <em class="calibre8" id="ch15--48">pre</em>proletariat, which in 1789 makes the revolution in the Paris faubourgs and absorbs all
      outcasts of feudal and guild society. You speak of proletarians—the expression squints—and include the weavers,
      whose importance you depict quite correctly—but only <em class="calibre8" id="ch15--49">after</em> declassed and nonguild
      journeymen weavers came into existence, and only <em class="calibre8" id="ch15--50">insofar as</em> this happened, can you count
      them among your “proletariat.”<sup class="calibre13" id="ch15--51"><a class="calibre14" id="ch15fn8"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch15fn8-r" id="ch15--53">8</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="noindent" id="ch15--54">
      The expression <em class="calibre8" id="ch15--55">proletariat</em> was ambiguous when applied to the plebeian mixture making up
      what Engels here calls the preproletariat (and which in <em class="calibre8" id="ch15--56">The German Ideology</em> had been
      called “the latent proletariat”).<sup class="calibre13" id="ch15--57"><a class="calibre14" id="ch15fn9"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch15fn9-r" id="ch15--59">9</a></sup> The expression “squints,” he writes, meaning that it looks both ways.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch15--60">
      But even up to the 1830s and 1840s the term <em class="calibre8" id="ch15--61">proletariat</em> in its centuries-old inclusive
      meaning was freely being used for <em class="calibre8" id="ch15--62">all</em> of the elements we have been discussing. In 1838 a
      prominent book by A. G. de Cassagnac made this explicit as a result of growing consciousness that wage-workers
      were no longer <em class="calibre8" id="ch15--63">precisely</em> the same as the rest of this old-proletariat. In a spirit of
      classification he distinguished among four groups making up the “proletariat,” of which the “workers” were only
      one. The other three were the beggars, the thieves, and the prostitutes.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch15--64"><a class="calibre14" id="ch15fn10"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch15fn10-r" id="ch15--66">10</a></sup> The French
      historian-statesman Guizot adopted the same classification.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch15--67"><a class="calibre14" id="ch15fn11"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch15fn11-r" id="ch15--69">11</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="indent" id="ch15--70">
      Note that in Cassagnac’s “proletariat” three out of four groups constitute exactly the type of elements that Marx
      called the lumpenproletariat. But in the world of the 1840s the packaging of these four groups under the single
      label of <em class="calibre8" id="ch15--71">proletariat</em>, while still the dominant approach by inertia, was intolerable for
      anyone trying to make sense of the new developments. It was doubly intolerable if it is true (as I have
      suggested)<sup class="calibre13" id="ch15--72"><a class="calibre14" id="ch15fn12"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch15fn12-r" id="ch15--74">12</a></sup> that the modern meaning of <em class="calibre8" id="ch15--75">proletariat</em> arose especially
      in the milieu of the new socialist-communist movement of the 1830s as a special designation for the newly
      prominent class of wage-workers. Some other term would have to be found for the other three groups in Cassagnac’s
      “proletariat,” and this was the function assumed (for Marx) by <em class="calibre8" id="ch15--76">lumpenproletariat.</em>
</div>
<div class="indent" id="ch15--77">
      Thus a natural confusion was engendered by overlapping movements <a class="calibre6" id="page_457"></a>in language in the junction
      between an old and a new social era. The word <em class="calibre8" id="ch15--79">lumpenproletariat</em> came in to designate a
      part of the old-proletariat but not of the modern proletariat.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch15--80">
      Still, there was a remaining element of ambiguity insofar as the social distinction between old-proletariat and
      modern proletariat was not yet complete and was even less completely grasped by contemporaries.
    </div>
<h3 class="h2" id="ch15lev2">2. FROM 1847 THROUGH THE REVOLUTION</h3>
<div class="indent" id="ch15--82">
      In <em class="calibre8" id="ch15--83">The German Ideology</em> both uses of <em class="calibre8" id="ch15--84">lumpenproletariat</em> referred
      mainly to the past, to obsolete social elements. The next usage brought it to the present, and was also the first
      time the word appeared in print (as far as I know).
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch15--85">
      In a minor article written around the year-end 1846-1847, Engels used the term in passing in the course of
      criticizing a poem by the “True Socialist” Karl Beck, whom we have mentioned before.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch15--86"><a class="calibre14" id="ch15fn13"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch15fn13-r" id="ch15--88">13</a></sup> Engels found one
      praiseworthy passage in Beck’s poem, a passage which he calls a “portrayal of the lumpenproletariat.” A beggar
      warns his daughter that if she bears a bastard the child is doomed to grow up into a thing that goes about
      begging, foraging in the gutters, huckstering on odd jobs, and the like—a derelict (says the summary couplet)
    </div>
<div class="indentt" id="ch15--89">
      That scrambles to steal and pimp and pray,

</div>
<div class="indent" id="ch15--94">
      It is implied that there is an existing social stratum to be called the lumpenproletariat. Engels spells out the
      implication a few months later in an unpublished manuscript, in a passage explaining why the proletariat cannot
      be expected to take the leadership of the coming revolution, because it is too weak and too badly split up and
      scattered:<sup class="calibre13" id="ch15--95"><a class="calibre14" id="ch15fn15"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch15fn15-r" id="ch15--97">15</a></sup>

      And the propertyless classes, in common parlance the working classes? … This division [of the propertyless or
      working classes] into farm-hands, day-laborers, artisan journeymen, factory workers, and lumpenproletariat …
      already makes it impossible for them to mutually clarify themselves about their unity of interests, to come to an
      understanding, to constitute themselves into a <em class="calibre8" id="ch15--99">single</em> class.
    </div>
<div class="noindent" id="ch15--100">
      Engels then sketches the backward consciousness of each section. For <a class="calibre6" id="page_458"></a>the last-mentioned, he

</div>
<div class="indent" id="ch15--110">
      There is a throwback here to the earlier sprawling conception of the “propertyless classes” as a unitary social
      formation, indicated by the apologetic reference to common parlance (<em class="calibre8" id="ch15--111">vulgo</em>); and in this
      framework the lumpenproletariat is quite clearly viewed as a constituent sector.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch15--112">
      The well-known passage in the <em class="calibre8" id="ch15--113">Communist Manifesto</em> emphasizes the shady social role of the

<div class="bqi" id="ch15--116">
      The lumpenproletariat, this passive putrefaction of the lowest strata of the old society, is here and there swept

      to sell itself to reactionary intrigues.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch15--117"><a class="calibre14" id="ch15fn19"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch15fn19-r" id="ch15--119">19</a></sup>

      This rotting mass is a “dangerous class,” to be sure, but what the Manifesto emphasizes is that it is a danger to
      the revolution. This statement was partly a summary of some past history and partly a prediction. The prediction
      was realized all too well in the course of the revolution of 1848-1849.

<div class="indent" id="ch15--121">
      The first case in point came, appropriately, when the revolutionary tide reached the city which—then and now—has
      a claim to the title of World Capital of the Lumpenproletariat: Naples, with its <em class="calibre8" id="ch15--122">lazzaroni.<a class="calibre16" id="ch15en4-r"></a><a class="nounder3" href="43.html#ch15en4" id="ch15--124">**</a></em>
</div>
<div class="indent" id="ch15--125">
<a class="calibre6" id="page_459"></a>Engels related the fate of the revolution in Naples in the first number of the <em class="calibre8" id="ch15--127">Neue Rheinische Zeitung.</em> The Bourbon king, Ferdinand II, mobilized his troops to overthrow the
      Chamber of Deputies, which was supported by the National Guard. At first “the 20,000 lazzaroni of Naples” were on
      the fence. The National Guard fought heroically against superior forces, and might even have won; but the failure
      of the French fleet offshore to intervene on the side of the bourgeois revolution pushed the lazzaroni over to
      the king’s camp. “By this step of the Neapolitan lumpenproletariat the defeat of the revolution was determined.”
      With the help of the lazzaroni, who were “the most greedy” of the king’s myrmidons, the National Guard was
      butchered. Engels also mentions that, years back, the lazzaroni formed the bulk of the <em class="calibre8" id="ch15--128">Sanfedisti</em>, papal storm-troops formed after 1815 to combat the revolutionary
      republicans.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch15--129"><a class="calibre14" id="ch15fn22"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch15fn22-r" id="ch15--131">22</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="indentb" id="ch15--132">
      Next: Paris. In one of the articles relating the events of the “June days,” Engels dwells on the savage role
      played by the Mobile Guard, which had been formed by the Provisional Government soon after the February seizure
      of power:
    </div>
<div class="bqi2" id="ch15--133">
      The Mobile Guard, which is recruited mostly out of the Paris lumpenproletariat, has, in its short period of
      existence, already been considerably transformed by means of good pay into a praetorian guard for the existing
      rulers. The organized lumpenproletariat gave battle to the unorganized working proletariat. As was to be
      expected, it put itself at the disposal of the bourgeoisie just as the lazzaroni in Naples had put themselves at
      the disposal of Ferdinand. Only those sections of the Mobile Guard that consisted of <em class="calibre8" id="ch15--134">real</em>
      workers went over to the other side.
    </div>
<div class="bqi2" id="ch15--135">
      But how despicable does this whole present business in Paris show up, when one sees these elements—yesterday
      beggars, vagabonds, rogues, street gamins and petty thieves—of the Mobile Guard, whom in March and April every
      bourgeois called a rascally band of brigands fit for any infamy and not to be tolerated any longer; when this
      band of brigands is now petted, praised, rewarded <a class="calibre6" id="page_460"></a>and decorated because these “young
      heroes,” these “children of Paris” of incomparable valor who scaled the barricades with the grandest courage,
      etc.—because these mindless barricade-fighters of February now shoot just as mindlessly at the working
      proletariat as they did before at the soldiers, because they let themselves be bought out with thirty sous a day

      Next: Belgium. There had been no uprising, but the government had panicked and cracked down in all directions.
      Eighteen republican leaders and militants of the Democratic movement were condemned to death after a sham trial.
      Engels quotes the <em class="calibre8" id="ch15--141">Journal d'Anvers</em> on the lack of interest in the affair on the part
      of the Antwerp population. “Only in the working classes,” claimed the paper, was there much feeling, and this was
      a feeling of hostility against the republicans. After “working classes,” Engels inserted parenthetically: “read:
      lumpenproletariat.”<sup class="calibre13" id="ch15--142"><a class="calibre14" id="ch15fn24"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch15fn24-r" id="ch15--144">24</a></sup>

<div class="indent" id="ch15--145">
      Then came the counterrevolution in Vienna in November, and the exploits of Baron Jellachich in smashing the
      Democrats with his “Croatian” troops. An article by Marx connected the pattern with Paris:
    </div>
<div class="bq" id="ch15--146">
      In Paris the Mobile Guard, in Vienna the “Croatians”—in both places lazzaroni, an armed and bought-out

<div class="indentb" id="ch15--151">
      That expectation was fulfilled in a matter of days. In an article on “The Counterrevolution in Berlin,” Marx
      summarized the pattern of counterrevolution in Europe as (like the revolution itself) it traveled from Italy to
      Paris to Vienna and Berlin. On Naples and Paris, his summary paragraphs are these:

      Finally, as for the “German campaign for the Reich constitution” in 1849, Engels summed up the role of the
      lumpen-elements crisply:
    </div>
<div class="bq" id="ch15--161">
      … the lumpenproletariat was, as everywhere, up for sale from the second day of the movement on; they demanded
      that the <a class="calibre6" id="page_461"></a>Committee of Safety give them arms and a stipend in the morning, and let themselves
      be bought up by the big bourgeoisie in the afternoon, to guard the latter’s buildings or tear down the barricades
      in the evening. On the whole they stood on the side with the bourgeoisie, which paid them best, and with this
      money they had a merry old time while the movement lasted.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch15--163"><a class="calibre14" id="ch15fn27"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch15fn27-r" id="ch15--165">27</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="indent" id="ch15--166">
      There certainly was no doubt in Marx’s and Engels’ minds about the dangerous role of the lumpenproletariat as an
      antirevolutionary tool, on the basis of the experience of the revolution as well as of history.
    </div>
<h3 class="h2" id="ch15lev3">3. THE “REFUSE OF ALL CLASSES”</h3>
<div class="indent" id="ch15--168">
      In a number of passages so far cited for the term <em class="calibre8" id="ch15--169">lumpenproletariat</em> we may note a certain
      ambivalence on whether this social stratum is to be regarded as a part of the proletariat or not. When it is
      contrasted to the “working proletariat” there is an implication that the lumpen-elements may be regarded as a
      part of the “non-working proletariat” in some way—if only by other people, as no doubt was the case. This
      confusing implication gets spelled out in Marx’s 1850 work on <em class="calibre8" id="ch15--170">The Class Struggles in
      France</em>, for the last time.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch15--171">
      The case in point is the composition of the Mobile Guard in France, which Engels had discussed on the heels of
      the June days. Marx explains that, after the February revolution, the Provisional Government felt the lack of a
      reliable armed force to use against the proletariat. He writes: “There consequently remained but one way out:
      <em class="calibre8" id="ch15--172">to play off one part of the proletariat against the other.</em>” He describes two ways in
      which this was done; the second way was by rallying “an army of industrial workers” through the so-called
      National Workshops. The first way was by playing off the lumpen-elements of the Mobile Guard against the
      proletariat:
    </div>
<div class="bqi2" id="ch15--173">
      For this purpose the Provisional Government formed 24 battalions of <em class="calibre8" id="ch15--174">Mobile Guards</em>, each a
      thousand strong, composed of young men from 15 to 20 years. They belonged for the most part to the <em class="calibre8" id="ch15--175">lumpenproletariat</em>, which in all big towns forms a mass sharply differentiated from the
      industrial proletariat, a recruiting ground for thieves and criminals of all kinds, living on the crumbs of
      society, people without a definite trade, vagabonds, <em class="calibre8" id="ch15--176">gens sans</em> <a class="calibre6" id="page_462"></a><em class="calibre8" id="ch15--178">feu et sans aveu</em> [homeless, rootless people], varying according to the
      degree of civilization of the nation to which they belong, but never renouncing their lazzaroni character; at the
      youthful age at which the Provisional Government recruited them, thoroughly malleable, as capable of the most
      heroic deeds and the most exalted sacrifices as of the basest banditry and the foulest corruption. The
      Provisional Government paid them one franc 50 centimes a day, that is, it bought them. It gave them their own
      uniform, that is, it differentiated them outwardly from the blue-collars [<em class="calibre8" id="ch15--179">Bluse</em>,
      overall-wearing workers]. In part it had assigned them officers from the standing army as leaders; in part they
      themselves elected young sons of the bourgeoisie whose rodomontades about death for the fatherland and devotion
      to the republic captivated them.
    </div>
<div class="bqi2" id="ch15--180">
      And so the Paris proletariat was confronted with an army, drawn from its own midst, of 24,000 young, strong,
      foolhardy men. … It [the proletariat] regarded it [the Mobile Guard] as the <em class="calibre8" id="ch15--181">proletarian</em>
      guard in contradistinction to the bourgeois National Guard. Its error was pardonable.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch15--182"><a class="calibre14" id="ch15fn28"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch15fn28-r" id="ch15--184">28</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="indentt" id="ch15--185">
      The ambivalence here is plain: on the one hand, the lumpen-elements are drawn “from its own midst,” that is,
      generated out of the ranks of the proletariat, and on the other hand “sharply differentiated from the industrial
      proletariat.” Differentiated as one part is differentiated from another part? The language reflects the confusion
      of the French workers and their “pardonable” error; indeed it sounds as if it harks back to the terminology of
      the old-proletariat.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch15--186">
      Viewed historically, the solution of the terminological confusion was also plain. For historically the
      lumpenproletariat <em class="calibre8" id="ch15--187">was</em> drawn from the midst of the working masses in the sense of being
      <em class="calibre8" id="ch15--188">precipitated out of them</em> (to use a chemical term) by the processes of developing
      bourgeois society. Engels’ later term “social scum” also suggests a process of separation. But scum separates by
      floating upward; these waste-products of society fall to the bottom, like the detritus that accumulates at the
      bottom of a canyon by disintegration and decay from all the strata above, making the streams muddy and turbid as
      it is carried off.
    </div>
<div class="indentb" id="ch15--189">
      About the same time Marx and Engels published a book review with an interesting passage on certain dubious
      circles on the periphery of society, with only an incidental mention of the lumpenproletariat. It serves to throw
      light on the subject from a quite different angle. The <a class="calibre6" id="page_463"></a>starting point is a couple of books
      on the Paris conspiratorial societies, which the reviewers use to explain the banefulness and futility of the
      Blanquist type of sect. A sharp distinction is made between the rank-and-file workers who follow these
      conspiratorial sects and the “professional conspirators” who work at it full-time and live off the proceeds. (The
      latter elements are here called a class, but the term must be taken loosely.)
    </div>
<div class="bqi2" id="ch15--191">
      This class’s position in life conditions its whole character from the outset. The proletarian conspiracy
      naturally offers them only very limited and uncertain means of livelihood. They are therefore continually forced
      to dip their fingers into the conspiracy’s treasury. Many of them also come into direct collision with bourgeois
      society in general and cut a more or less graceful figure before the police courts. They are impelled into the
      circles which Paris calls <em class="calibre8" id="ch15--192">la boheme</em>, by their precarious existence, which in regard to
      particulars is more dependent on chance than on their own actions; by their irregular life, whose only fixed
      stops are the wineshops—the conspirators’ meeting-places; by their inevitable association with all kinds of
      dubious people. These democratic bohemians of proletarian origin (there is also a democratic <em class="calibre8" id="ch15--193">boheme</em> of bourgeois origin, the democratic loafers and bar-flies) are therefore either workers
      who have given up working and as a result have become dissolute, or elements that stem from the lumpenproletariat
      and carry over all the dissolute habits of this class into their new life. It can be understood how under these
      circumstances a couple of jailbirds are to be found involved in almost every conspiracy trial.
    </div>
<div class="bqi2" id="ch15--194">
      The whole life of these professional conspirators bears the character of the <em class="calibre8" id="ch15--195">bohême</em> most

      We will meet this <em class="calibre8" id="ch15--200">boheme</em> again, for a closer look. Let us note that in this passage it is
      treated as being more inclusive than the lumpenproletariat. The difference narrows in the next passage to be
      discussed, but we should not think that we are dealing with hard-edged social strata susceptible of exact
      definition.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch15--201"><a class="calibre14" id="ch15fn29a"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch15fn29-ra" id="ch15--203">29a</a></sup>

      The basic breakthrough on the meaning of the lumpenproletariat was made two years later, in Marx’s portrait of
      that class in <em class="calibre8" id="ch15--205">The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte</em>. The scene is still—or again—
      France, especially Paris.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch15--206">
      As we saw, Engels pointed the finger at the Mobile Guard at the first opportunity in 1848. In his <em class="calibre8" id="ch15--207">Class Struggles in France</em> Marx continued <a class="calibre6" id="page_464"></a>the discussion of the Mobile
      Guard, and already referred to “the Society of December 10, that organization of the Paris
      lumpenproletariat.”<sup class="calibre13" id="ch15--209"><a class="calibre14" id="ch15fn30"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch15fn30-r" id="ch15--211">30</a></sup> This society, whose name commemorated Bonaparte’s election to the presidency on
      December 10, 1848, was a sort of storm-troop organization established and paid by Bonaparte to further his plans.
      It played an important part in his coup d’etat. Now Marx devotes a special analysis to this new embodiment of the
      lumpen-counterrevolution:

<div class="bq" id="ch15--212">
      On the pretext of founding a benevolent society, the lumpenproletariat of Paris had been organized into secret

      offshoots of the bourgeoisie, were vagabonds, discharged soldiers, discharged jailbirds, escaped galley slaves,

<div class="indent" id="ch15--235">
      Marx and Engels never used the German word <em class="calibre8" id="ch15--236">Lumpenproletariat</em> when writing in English or
      French; they sought a native substitute that would suggest the social element, as when they impressed <em class="calibre8" id="ch15--237">lazzaroni</em> for the purpose. In English they occasionally used <em class="calibre8" id="ch15--238">mob.</em><a class="calibre6" id="ch15en6-r"></a><a class="nounder1" href="43.html#ch15en6" id="ch15--240">*</a>

      Both <em class="calibre8" id="ch15--242">lazzaroni</em> and <em class="calibre8" id="ch15--243">mob</em> occur in Marx’s explanation in the <em class="calibre8" id="ch15--244">New York Tribune</em> of the events of the Spanish revolution in 1813-1814, when the city
      lumpenproletariat aided the counterrevolutionary reaction. The “mob” (what Hobsbawm calls the “Church and King
      Mob”) gave the king a triumphant welcome to Madrid; the “rabble” hurried to remove the word Liberty over the
      entrance to the Cortes; and one of the factors in the victory of the reaction was “these shameless demonstrations
      of the town mob, partly paid for their performances, and like the Lazzaroni of Naples, preferring the wanton rule
      of kings and monks to the sober regime of the middle classes.”<sup class="calibre13" id="ch15--245"><a class="calibre14" id="ch15fn34"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch15fn34-r" id="ch15--247">34</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="indent" id="ch15--248">
      Marx even uses <em class="calibre8" id="ch15--249">mob</em> in a letter to Engels, in German, dealing with the American Civil War.
      Of the Southern slaveholding oligarchy:
    </div>
<div class="bq" id="ch15--250">
      In a part of the °“poor whites”° they found the °mob,° who acted for them as substitutes of the Zouaves.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch15--251"><a class="calibre14" id="ch15fn35"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch15fn35-r" id="ch15--253">35</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="noindent" id="ch15--254">
      And in a letter to Marx, Engels uses still another combination, referring to the French revolutionary terror of
      1793: one of the elements was <a class="calibre6" id="page_466"></a>the <em class="calibre8" id="ch15--256">“Lumpenmob”</em> which took advantage

<div class="indent" id="ch15--260">
      All in all, one of the most consistent notes struck about the <em class="calibre8" id="ch15--261">Lumpenmob</em> is its aptness
      for use as a tool of reaction. For example, describing a demonstration in Hyde Park assaulted by the police, with
      many arrests, Marx notes that the prisoners are guarded by shady figures “pressed into the service of the London
      police out of the Irish lumpenproletariat.”<sup class="calibre13" id="ch15--262"><a class="calibre14" id="ch15fn37"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch15fn37-r" id="ch15--264">37</a></sup>

<div class="indent" id="ch15--265">
      Marx’s and Engels’ views on the role of the lumpen-class only hardened as time went on. By 1870 there was a
      special reason for the vehemence of Engels’ language in a new preface to <em class="calibre8" id="ch15--266">The Peasant War in
      Germany</em>. He is stressing that the proletariat, still far from a majority in Germany, is compelled to seek
      allies. “These are to be found only among the petty-bourgeoisie, the lumpenproletariat of the cities, the small
      peasants and the agricultural laborers.” He proceeds to evaluate these. On the second category:
    </div>
<div class="bqi" id="ch15--267">
      The <em class="calibre8" id="ch15--268">lumpenproletariat</em>, this scum of depraved elements from all classes, with headquarters
      in the big cities, is the worst of all the possible allies. This rabble is absolutely venal and absolutely
      brazen. If the French workers, in every revolution, inscribed on the houses: <em class="calibre8" id="ch15--269">Mort aux
      voleurs!</em> Death to thieves! and even shot some, they did it not out of reverence for property, but because
      they rightly considered it necessary above all to get rid of that gang. Every leader of the workers who uses
      these scoundrels as guards or relies on them for support proves himself by this action alone a traitor to the
      movement.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch15--270"><a class="calibre14" id="ch15fn38"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch15fn38-r" id="ch15--272">38</a></sup>

      For around this time they were beginning to discover the peculiarities of Bakunin’s ideology, especially those
      aspects emphasized in his Russian-language writings. They set forth these elements of the Bakuninist plan of
      revolution in the exposé which they published in 1873 on behalf of the International.<a class="calibre6" id="ch15en7-r"></a><a class="nounder1" href="43.html#ch15en7" id="ch15--275">*</a>
</div>
<div class="indent" id="ch15--276">
      Bakunin (going beyond suggestions in Weitling) was the first figure <a class="calibre6" id="page_467"></a>to systematically
      proclaim the lumpen-elements as the class motor of his revolution, or an important gear in it. Indeed, “the very
      type of the revolutionary” for Bakunin (explained Marx, Engels, et al., in the International pamphlet) was the
      brigand, the only true revolutionary in Russia.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch15--278"><a class="calibre14" id="ch15fn40"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch15fn40-r" id="ch15--280">40</a></sup> More generally, his revolutionary vanguard was to be
      systematically based on the <em class="calibre8" id="ch15--281">déclassés</em>, the socially declassed—those who have lost their
      place in society and lead a marginal existence. The International pamphlet quoted the text of a letter by Bakunin
      to a follower, explaining why Italy and Spain are the most revolutionary countries, including this:
    </div>
<div class="bq" id="ch15--282">
      There exists in Italy [Bakunin wrote] what is lacking in other countries: a youth which is ardent, energetic,
      <em class="calibre8" id="ch15--283">completely displaced, without a career, without a way out</em>, and which, despite its
      bourgeois origin, is not morally and intellectually exhausted like the bourgeois youth of the other

      In Bakunin’s ideology, the proletariat in the Marxian sense—that is, wage-workers who work more or less stably
      and, worse still, get paid more or less regularly—are “bourgeois” (an all-purpose imprecation with little
      content). The Bakuninist stand-in for the proletariat is the lumpen-world, which is to play the role as Nick
      Bottom did that of the lion.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch15--288"><a class="calibre14" id="ch15fn42"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch15fn42-r" id="ch15--290">42</a></sup> These are the urban déclassés of the lower classes. Then, as we have already
      seen, there is the peasantry (because they represent “barbarism”), plus the déclassé offscourings or refuse of
      the upper classes, to which the Russian aristocracy makes its rich contribution. All these make up the “marginal
      class,” “restless and fierce,” which is to make the revolution.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch15--291"><a class="calibre14" id="ch15fn43"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch15fn43-r" id="ch15--293">43</a></sup> That is, these are the class elements which

      Marx’s.

      Utilization of this “restless and fierce” (that is, unstable and vicious) class was not confined to adventurers
      like Bakunin, though it was not always acknowledged or theorized. For this class is available and it is volatile.
      These two attractive features are specially tempting to ambitious leaders who have neither the hope nor the
      desire to move real social forces into motion through a protracted process. A case in point was portrayed by
      Engels, as he described the operation of the self-styled “Marxist” group in England, the Social Democratic
      Federation <a class="calibre6" id="page_468"></a>under H. M. Hyndman, of whom Marx and Engels took the dimmest of views.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch15--297">
      The occasion was a trough of depression and mounting unemployment in 1886. A reformist workers’ group which
      proposed to cure the crisis by “fair trade” (retaliatory tariffs) called a demonstration in Trafalgar Square; the
      S.D.F. called its own meeting for the same place. Engels reports:
    </div>
<div class="bq" id="ch15--298">
      So two meetings took place … Kautsky was there and went away before the rumpus started; he told me that the mass
      of the real workers had been among the pro-tariff people, whereas Hyndman &amp; Co. had a mixed audience of
      people looking to go on a spree, part of them already a little high. If Kautsky who has been here hardly a year
      could see this, the gentlemen of the Federation must have seen it even better. Nevertheless, when it already all
      seemed to be petering out, they put an old favorite idea of Hyndman’s into operation, namely, a parade of
      “unemployed” through Pall Mall … The unemployed who followed them in order to hold a renewed meeting in Hyde Park
      were mostly the sort who don’t want any kind of work at all, peddlers, street bums, police spies, spivs…. During
      the parade, during this small second meeting, and afterwards, the masses of the lumpenproletariat whom Hyndman
      had taken for the unemployed surged through some adjoining elegant streets, looted jewelry shops and others, used
      the breadloaves and mutton joints they had [previously] looted solely to break in windows, and then scattered,
      without meeting resistance.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch15--299"><a class="calibre14" id="ch15fn44"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch15fn44-r" id="ch15--301">44</a></sup>

<div class="indent" id="ch15--311">
      A finishing touch to Marx’s view of the relation between the lumpen-class and the proletariat is given in the
      first volume of <em class="calibre8" id="ch15--312">Capital.</em> The “disintegrated mass” of social excreta is clearly and
      definitively distinguished not only from any part of the proletariat but even from the <em class="calibre8" id="ch15--313">nonworking</em> elements of the producing classes.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch15--314">
      The rife confusion on this point would be hard to account for, therefore, except that translations (into English
      and other languages) have helped to obscure the meaning of the passage. We shall see that Marx refers here to
      “the lumpenproletariat proper,” a phrase which signals a careful distinction; but it is replaced, in the
      Moore-Aveling translation edited by Engels, by the phrase “the ‘dangerous’ classes,” which we discuss
      elsewhere.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch15--315"><a class="calibre14" id="ch15fn46"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch15fn46-r" id="ch15--317">46</a></sup>

      The context is Marx’s analysis of the “industrial reserve army” as a basic phenomenon of the capitalist system.
      The brief reference to the lumpenproletariat will be clear only if we start a little way back.

<div class="indent" id="ch15--319">
      Developed capitalism, in Marx’s analysis, needs “a surplus laboring population”—surplus in relation to
      capitalism’s ability to utilize this population productively. “It forms a disposable industrial reserve army … a
      mass of human material always ready for exploitation.” As capitalism’s cyclical needs for labor go up and down,
      this reserve army can be employed or discarded as necessary. When on “reserve,” it is unemployed or partially
      employed. “The whole form of the movement of modern industry depends, therefore, upon the constant transformation
      of a part of the laboring population into unemployed or half-employed hands.” The movements of wages are
      determined “by the varying proportions in which the working class is divided into active and reserve army … by
      the extent to which it is now absorbed, now set free [discarded].”<sup class="calibre13" id="ch15--320"><a class="calibre14" id="ch15fn47"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch15fn47-r" id="ch15--322">47</a></sup>

      This pool of “surplus” workers, or “reserve army” of labor, “exists in every possible form. Every laborer belongs
      to it during the time when he is only partially employed or wholly unemployed.” Its forms are three: “the
      floating, the latent, the stagnant.”<sup class="calibre13" id="ch15--324"><a class="calibre14" id="ch15fn48"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch15fn48-r" id="ch15--326">48</a></sup> It is with the last form that we come to the lowest stratum of the working

<div class="bqi" id="ch15--327">
<a class="calibre6" id="page_470"></a>The third category of the relative surplus-production, the stagnant, forms a part of the
      active labor army but with extremely irregular employment. Hence it furnishes to capital an inexhaustible
      reservoir of disposable labor-power. Its conditions of life sink below the average normal level of the working
      class … But it forms at the same time a self-reproducing and self-perpetuating element of the working class
      …<sup class="calibre13" id="ch15--329"><a class="calibre14" id="ch15fn49"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch15fn49-r" id="ch15--331">49</a></sup>

<div class="noindent" id="ch15--332">
      This is still a sector of the proletariat. It is not a question of how many days a year this stagnant sector
      works, and still less of pinning a proletarian label as an honorific decoration. The point is objectively
      economic: this sector has a function to play in the processes of capitalism, whether employed or not at any given
      time. And the same is true of the next stratum:

      The lowest sediment of the relative surplus-production, finally, dwells in the sphere of pauperism. Exclusive of

<div class="noindent" id="ch15--339">
      It is clear that “vagabonds, criminals, prostitutes” are illustrative examples of “the lumpenproletariat proper,”
      which is being sharply separated from even the lowest sedimentary layers of the proletariat, even from those

      objective economic grounds? The answer is given in the same passage:

<div class="bq" id="ch15--344">
      Pauperism is the hospital of the active labor-army and the dead weight of the industrial reserve army. Its
      production is included in that of the relative surplus-population, its necessity in theirs; along with the
      surplus-population, pauperism forms a condition of capitalist production, and of the capitalist development of
      wealth.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch15--345"><a class="calibre14" id="ch15fn51"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch15fn51-r" id="ch15--347">51</a></sup>

      This segment Marx then calls “the lazarus-layers of the working class,” <a class="calibre6" id="page_471"></a>whose extent denotes

      working class which has forfeited its condition of existence (the sale of labor-power), and vegetates upon public
      alms.”<sup class="calibre13" id="ch15--353"><a class="calibre14" id="ch15fn53"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch15fn53-r" id="ch15--355">53</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="indent" id="ch15--356">
      The “lazarus-layers” or pauperized segments of the working class constitute “a condition of capitalist
      production,” not merely a consequence of capitalist conditions. But the lumpenproletariat falls outside this
      relationship: it does not constitute an economic condition for the existence of capitalism; it is produced as a
      <em class="calibre8" id="ch15--357">consequence</em> of developed capitalism, as a waste product—just as certain contemporary
      forms of crime are a consequence of the social order but not a prerequisite for it.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch15--358">
      Marx’s analysis in the <em class="calibre8" id="ch15--359">Grundrisse</em> manuscripts emphasizes even more strongly that
      pauperism is an integral and indispensable feature of the socioeconomic system. “Free labor = latent pauperism,”
      he writes aphoristically; that is, the worker always remains free to be relegated to the lazarus-layers of the
      reserve army. Previous societies had surplus people but they were surplus nonworkers. “The invention of surplus
      workers, that is, of propertyless people who work, belongs to the period of capital.”<sup class="calibre13" id="ch15--360"><a class="calibre14" id="ch15fn54"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch15fn54-r" id="ch15--362">54</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="indent" id="ch15--363">
      While the lumpenproletariat, then, is sharply distinguished from the pauperized layers of the surplus population,
      still it may be recruited from the lazarus-layers: that is a different matter. Continuous unemployment and
      consequent demoralization may push individuals out of the working classes altogether and into the underworld or
      the skid rows. This is also a form of declassment, a precipitation out of the proletariat.

      popular novel of 1859, <em class="calibre8" id="ch15--379">La Bohême Dorée.</em> Marx refers to “the exodus from Paris [to
      Versailles] of the high Bonapartist and capitalist boheme,” and later remarks that Versaillese Paris after the

      established a German <a class="calibre6" id="page_473"></a>émigré organ in London, Marx opined that its “editors are recruited

      literary bohemia of the Parisian garret; for in the case of another German émigré littérateur, E. Biskamp, a
      letter by Marx mentioned his wretched circumstances and how he managed to eke out a miserable existence as a
      <em class="calibre8" id="ch15--410">bohémien.</em> The French form of the term was probably suggested by the French background of
      the lumpen-bohemian world.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch15--411"><a class="calibre14" id="ch15fn62"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch15fn62-r" id="ch15--413">62</a></sup> But these casual expressions are not to be taken literally any more than Marx’s

      Something more than metaphor is evident in the following case. Marx is describing the dominance of the “finance

      … the same prostitution, the same shameless cheating, the same mania to get rich was repeated in every sphere,
      from the Court to the Café Borgne [disreputable saloon], to get rich not by production, but by pocketing the
      already available wealth of others. Clashing every moment with the bourgeois laws themselves, an unbridled
      assertion of unhealthy and dissolute appetites manifested itself, particularly at the top of bourgeois
      society—lusts wherein wealth derived from gambling naturally seeks its satisfaction, where pleasure becomes
      debauched, where money, filth and blood commingle. The finance aristocracy, in its mode of acquisition as well as
      in its pleasures, is nothing but the <em class="calibre8" id="ch15--419">rebirth of the lumpenproletariat on the heights of

      excrescences from the body social of the rich as the other lumpen-elements are from the poor; who are indeed as
      dangerous to the long-range interests of the real capitalist class as the others are to the real proletariat. As
      excrescences not functionally integral to the social system, they are economic demimondaines, outsiders in a
      special sense, just as the lower-class lumpen-elements are dropouts from society in a special sense. They are
      lumpen-bourgeois.

      superstructure that Bonaparte raised on top of the already existing superstructure of society. Moreover, Marx
      regarded Bonaparte’s utilization of the state apparatus as parasitically oriented; that is, for Bonaparte the
      state was to be used as a “protection racket” to skim off a fat “take” for the benefit of himself and his

      flows from the personal character of Louis Napoleon Bonaparte himself, a character that plays a prominent part in
      all of Marx’s detailed analyses of this period of French history. Still less is it a requisite of capitalism; on
      the contrary, it is inimical to capitalism and to the short-range and long-range interests of the bourgeoisie.

      The variegated lumpen-elements around Bonaparte were truly the “scum, offal, refuse of all classes,” not simply

      These peasant draft-substitutes—why are they lumpen-elements? Certainly not because of underworld activity. The
      label here derives from the central idea of the classification: they are elements that are being squeezed out of
      the peasant economy and hence out of a place in society; they are being exuded, extruded, excreted from the class
      structure and onto the scrapheap.

      This is the conception to be borne in mind when next we hear of lumpen-aristocrats. Dealing with a period in
      Polish history when big peasants developed into “a sort of <em class="calibre8" id="ch15--469">peasant middle class</em>, the
      <em class="calibre8" id="ch15--470">Equestrian Order</em>” which eventually collapsed, Marx writes that

<div class="bq" id="ch15--471">
      this Equestrian Order, incapable of playing the role of a real middle class, is transformed into the

      Writing much later, Engels is describing the formation of the Prussian Junkerdom. There is the “petty landowning
      gentry”; there are the younger sons in the army or civil service who make up the “less wealthy petty nobility”;

<a class="calibre6" id="page_476"></a>On the lower fringes of all this clique of nobles, there naturally emerges a numerous

      These waste-product elements may find a new social berth on a lower class level (declassment), as when the
      indigent scion of aristocracy becomes a schoolteacher, the parson’s son “goes into trade,” or the bankrupt
      shopkeeper goes to work in a factory. But the déclassé who succeeds in relocating socially thereby avoids falling
      into the lumpen-class.

<h3 class="h2" id="ch15lev7">7. THE CLASS CLOACA</h3>
<div class="indent" id="ch15--485">
      With some additional illustrations from the writings of Marx and Engels, let us emphasize a point that has
      already been made in the preceding section: the lumpen-class is not only a social formation outside the
      proletariat, it is best defined as the class cloaca that is functionally outside the ongoing social structure.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch15--486">
      It is interesting to see how this relationship is confusedly expressed in Marx’s first notes on political
      economy, the Paris manuscripts of 1844—that is, before he had got very far in his analysis of the social
      structure, and before the concept of the lumpenproletariat had even achieved expression. The context is his
      charge that capital is interested in the worker not as a human being but only as a source of capital, as a
      commodity, and otherwise lets him starve in unemployment. He complains:
    </div>
<div class="bq" id="ch15--487">
      Political economy therefore does not recognize the unemployed worker, the working human being, insofar as he is
      outside this labor relationship. The rascal, swindler, beggar, the unemployed or starving or down-and-out or
      criminal worker/human-being, are <em class="calibre8" id="ch15--488">figures</em> that do not exist <em class="calibre8" id="ch15--489">for
      political economy</em> …<sup class="calibre13" id="ch15--490"><a class="calibre14" id="ch15fn75"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch15fn75-r" id="ch15--492">75</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="noindent" id="ch15--493">
      Since the unemployed and pauperized workers are here put in the same bag with criminals and beggars, he does not
      yet understand that the latter (typifying the lumpen-class proper) <em class="calibre8" id="ch15--494">are</em> outside the
      purview of political economy, that is, outside the social system of which a political <a class="calibre6" id="page_477"></a>economy is the theoretical expression. This is an objective feature of the society, not a defect
      of the political economists.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch15--496">
      It may seem callous to group criminals and beggars together, but the criterion is not a moral or juridical one,
      which may have force in some other connection. For that matter, it is important to understand that there are
      <em class="calibre8" id="ch15--497">working</em> lumpen-elements too, even though Marx began by contrasting the lumpenproletariat
      to the “working proletariat.” We have seen working lumpenproletarians listed as examples more than once, from
      peddlers and knife-grinders to prostitutes and brothel keepers (the latter approximating lumpen-bourgeois). This
      category is specifically noted in the <em class="calibre8" id="ch15--498">Grundrisse</em> notebooks, as Marx explains the
      distinction between productive and unproductive labor:
    </div>
<div class="bq" id="ch15--499">
      From the whore to the pope, there is a mass of such riffraff [doing unproductive labor]. But the honest and
      “working” lumpenproletariat falls under this head too; e.g., big gang of hangers-on offering service etc. in port
      cities etc.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch15--500"><a class="calibre14" id="ch15fn76"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch15fn76-r" id="ch15--502">76</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="noindent" id="ch15--503">
      The example, as often, is that of casual and irregular labor, like that of a tramp who offers to cut wood for a
      meal. Another reference to the lumpen-class in the <em class="calibre8" id="ch15--504">Grundrisse</em>, a dozen pages away, speaks
      however only of the dishonest lumpenproletariat. It is merely a passing mention as Marx argues that the worker
      cannot advance by heaping up savings as good bourgeois urge, for he would achieve only a brutalizing asceticism
      “if he saved money in good ascetic style and so piled up prizes for the lumpenproletariat, swindlers, etc., who
      would increase in proportion to the demand.”<sup class="calibre13" id="ch15--505"><a class="calibre14" id="ch15fn77"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch15fn77-r" id="ch15--507">77</a></sup>

      The casual laborer without ties or roots is also the subject of a reference in a chatty tourist note from Marx,
      visiting Cannes. The town

<div class="bq" id="ch15--509">
      is “monumental,” since it consists only of hotels; here [there are] no plebeian “masses,” outside of the <em class="calibre8" id="ch15--510">garçons d’hôtels, de café</em>, etc. and <em class="calibre8" id="ch15--511">domestiques</em> belonging to the
      lumpenproletariat.

      What all these elements, honest or dishonest, have in common is that they are functionless outsiders, as discards
      of the system or self-discards. To be sure, a nonworking status may be the indicator, as when the Roman plebs
      degenerated into lumpen-elements. When the free peasants of ancient Rome were stripped of land and livelihood,
      says <a class="calibre6" id="page_478"></a>Marx, “The Roman proletarians became not wage-laborers but a <em class="calibre8" id="ch15--518">mob
      fainéant</em> [mob of do-nothings] more abject than the former ‘poor whites’ in the South of the United States
      …”<sup class="calibre13" id="ch15--519"><a class="calibre14" id="ch15fn79"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch15fn79-r" id="ch15--521">79</a></sup>

<div class="indent" id="ch15--522">
      Individuals who are torn from their social roots and left treading air are natural candidates for the
      lumpen-class, and therefore we have seen Marx use the term more than once about émigrés. Lest it be thought that
      its use is always derogatory, let us note that it occurs in a bleak comment about a sympathetic figure, an émigré
      Pole on whose fate Marx reported sadly in a letter to Engels. Having fallen into the deepest poverty, he “had
      sunk down to being a lumpenproletarian in Whitechapel,” and was finally burned to death in a slum fire. “First to
      go to the dogs [<em class="calibre8" id="ch15--523">verlumpen</em>], then to starve, and finally get burned to death, is all one
      can ask for in this ‘best of worlds,’” grumbles Marx at a time when his own affairs were grim.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch15--524"><a class="calibre14" id="ch15fn80"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch15fn80-r" id="ch15--526">80</a></sup> To be
      sure, Whitechapel itself—more generally, the East End of London of which Whitechapel is a part-brought the
      lumpen-class to mind, for this was its stamping-ground, as well as the home of the most depressed sectors of the
      London working class at this time. We saw, in <a class="nounder1" href="11.html#ch04" id="ch15--527">Chapter
      4</a>, that when the “New Unionism” revolutionized the East End, Engels cheered particularly because this meant
      that the lumpenproletariat would be pushed into the background and the real workers of the district would come to
      the fore.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch15--528"><a class="calibre14" id="ch15fn81"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch15fn81-r" id="ch15--530">81</a></sup>

<div class="indent" id="ch15--531">
      To repeat and to sum up: the lumpen-class is the catch-all for those who fall out, or drop out, of the existing
      social structure so that they are no longer functionally an integral part of the society. To survive at all, in
      the interstices of the society, they may have to adopt a parasitic mode of existence. The tendency toward
      illegality, criminality, and so on simply arises from the scarcity of other choices.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch15--532">
      Experience demonstrated to Marx and Engels that, on the whole, the elements of the lumpen-class tend to be
      inhospitable to social ideals socially implemented—for what is society to them, or they to society?— and that
      they are typically moved by cynical self-interest on the most vulgar level, however rationalized; hence they tend
      to be venal, available to the highest bidder; attracted to the bandwagon of the winner, or distracted by circuses
      with or without bread; unlikely to become serious about any social cause or motivated by any political vision;
      untrustworthy even when bought up, and dangerous even as tools: “the worst of all possible allies.” As Engels
      said, “Every leader of the workers who … relies on them for support proves himself by this action alone a traitor
      to the movement.”
