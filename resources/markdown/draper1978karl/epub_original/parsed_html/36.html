<div class="indent" id="noteh--6">
      This Special Note began as a modest footnote in <a class="nounder1" href="10.html#ch03" id="noteh--7">Chapter
      3</a> on Marx’s use of <em class="calibre8" id="noteh--8">asses</em>, in rejoinder to Professor Shlomo Avineri. But quoting
      Avineri on <em class="calibre8" id="noteh--9">asses</em> opened a Pandora’s box; the subject ramified, as we shall see, from a
      thesis about <em class="calibre8" id="noteh--10">asses</em> to a thesis about intellectuals. Following the ramifications is not an
      idle enterprise: it will offer us an insight into the methods of marxology, a subject that we slight in this work
      in our emphasis on positive presentation.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="noteh--11">
      Avineri has expressed umbrage more than once at Marx’s offense in calling certified proletarians <em class="calibre8" id="noteh--12">asses.</em> His context is a thesis about Marx and “the intellectuals” that is quite popular among
      marxologists. This thesis claims that Marx looked to the rule of the intellectuals, not the proletariat, and it
      was first invented by Bakunin.<sup class="calibre13" id="noteh--13"><a class="calibre14" id="notehfn1"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#notehfn1-r" id="noteh--15">1</a></sup> Avineri is unusual in that he purports to present “documentation” for this
      thesis or something like it. Since we want to be sure we have before us all possible documentation from Marx not
      only on this matter but also on the question of <em class="calibre8" id="noteh--16">asses</em>, we must examine Avineri’s
      proffered documentation with interest.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="noteh--17">
      Professor Avineri is unusual in another respect, the sophistication of his writings on Marx; for he has an
      advantage over many writers in the field in that he has actually read Marx’s works. His book <em class="calibre8" id="noteh--18">The Social and Political Thought of Karl Marx</em> is one of the more knowledgeable productions on
      the subject. Naturally he has his own notion of what needs discussing, and we and Voltaire will fight to the
      death for his right to his opinion, since this may appear odd at first blush. His chapter section on Marx’s
      theory of the proletariat (pages 52-64) is almost entirely devoted to Marx’s early years up to the Manifesto,
      that is, to the beginnings of Marx’s thinking on the subject. The rest of Marx’s life—the theory of the mature
      Marx—is covered in a laconic half page.

    </div>
<div class="indent" id="noteh--24">
      Let us take up this pithy précis. I pass over its first sentence, since I do not understand it: “Nevertheless,
      because Marx’s relation to the proletariat is not immediate but is reached through speculative considerations, he
      does not reveal much empathy [for] or spiritual attachment to the members of the working class.” I think this
      says that since he was not himself a proletarian he could have no empathy for or “spiritual attachment” to
      proletarians, but I hesitate to impute such a blatant non sequitur to a sophisticated marxologist; and since
      Marx’s passionate evocations of workers’ conditions of life in <em class="calibre8" id="noteh--25">Capital</em> and elsewhere are
      notorious, I hesitate to believe this means what it says. But never mind—no matter.
    </div>
<div class="indentb" id="noteh--26">
      The rest of Avineri’s terse treatment goes as follows, in toto, including two footnotes:
    </div>
<div class="bq" id="noteh--27">
      Marx’s sceptical view of the proletariat’s ability to conceive its own goals and realize them without outside
      intellectual help has often been documented. It suits his remark that revolutions never start with the “masses”
      but originate in elite groups.<sup class="calibre13" id="noteh--28"><a class="calibre14" id="anotehfn1"></a><a class="nounder2" href="43.html#anotehfn1-r" id="noteh--30">1</a></sup> Much as Marx always opposed those socialists who tried explicitly to dissociate
      themselves from the proletariat, a chief reason for the split in the League of Communists in 1850 was Marx’s
      uncertainty about what would happen to the League if it were to be exclusively proletarian in membership. Marx’s
      opponents within the League even went so far as to accuse him of trying to impose intellectual discipline on the
      proletarian movement; and Weitling was sometimes snubbed by Marx as the Tailors’ King.<sup class="calibre13" id="noteh--31"><a class="calibre14" id="anotehfn2"></a><a class="nounder2" href="43.html#anotehfn2-r" id="noteh--33">2</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="indent" id="noteh--34">
<a class="calibre6" id="page_637"></a>So Avineri,<sup class="calibre13" id="noteh--36"><a class="calibre14" id="notehfn2"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#notehfn2-r" id="noteh--38">2</a></sup> on Marx’s “sceptical view of the proletariat’s ability to conceive its own goals
      and realize them without outside intellectual help.” Most readers will assume that <em class="calibre8" id="noteh--39">intellectual help</em> means <em class="calibre8" id="noteh--40">help from intellectuals</em> (and we will see that
      Avineri really does mean this). Now, to be sure, we have emphasized at some length that in Marx’s view the
      proletariat needed a great deal of help, for it could win only at the head of an alliance with other class
      elements. But why Avineri’s single insistence on the help of the intellectuals only, unless some other concept is
      being insinuated? We see that Avineri is so sophisticated that he refrains from rushing in where others have
      trodden, namely, putting down in so many words the common thesis that Marx looked to a revolution led by an
      intellectual elite and not by the working class. Avineri does not <em class="calibre8" id="noteh--41">say</em> this; but his
      laudable restraint makes the subsequent presentation look odd.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="noteh--42">
      Proceeding to documentation, he remarks that this skeptical view of Marx’s has “often been documented”: this
      seems to imply that a considerable documentation exists somewhere, and if he offers a few examples these must be
      particularly cogent since they are selected from such a mass.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="noteh--43">
      1. First documentation: he adduces Marx’s “remark that revolutions never start with the ‘masses’ but originate in
      elite groups.” This statement is explained by a footnote, where we learn that Marx made no such remark, that the
      “remark”—not to put a fine point on it—is a fabrication. But it is not a dishonest fabrication, for anyone who
      bothers to look down to the bottom of the page can discover that the remark is Avineri’s concoction, not Marx’s.
      The chasm between the provocative statement in the text and the irrelevancy in the small-type footnote is not
      uncommon in the methods of marxology; what is commendable is that Avineri honorably offers his own refutation.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="noteh--44">
      We discover in the footnote that the “intellectual help” came in the first case not from “intellectuals” but from
      French nobles, and in the second from Indian sepoys—not groups that come readily to mind as representatives of
      intellectuality. We discover that this help was given not to proletarians but to peasants (French peasants or
      Indian ryots). In short, the help was given by nonintellectuals to nonproletarians; and this somehow documents a
      thesis about intellectuals and proletarians. In neither of the two historical cases is there a proletariat even
      in presence, for Marx to be skeptical about.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="noteh--45">
      We discover that the flat counterposition of masses to elite is a sort of pun by Avineri: the sepoys were native
      Indian soldiers who came right out of the Indian masses. By tagging them <em class="calibre8" id="noteh--46">elite</em> Avineri is
      word-playing on the notion of a social or class elite, whereas the sepoys’ <a class="calibre6" id="page_638"></a>favored position
      was that of troops given extra privileges in order to buy them off.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="noteh--48">
      We discover that another manipulation is exercised with the word <em class="calibre8" id="noteh--49">start</em>. It was well known
      before Marx that the initial crack in a regime or system often comes on top (reacting to pressure from below, to
      be sure), after which the masses pour through the crack so opened up.<a class="calibre6" id="notehen1-r"></a><a class="nounder1" href="43.html#notehen1" id="noteh--51">*</a> Marx’s mere mention of this well-known historical pattern becomes
      documentation of a <em class="calibre8" id="noteh--52">theory</em> that the proletariat (who do not figure in the picture) can
      never realize a revolution without intellectuals, whoever they are.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="noteh--53">
      In Marx’s article, unquoted by Avineri’s documentation, the two historical cases are offered as examples of a
      preceding generalization. This generalization is not the one invented by our marxologist. Marx’s goes as follows:
      “There is something in human history like retribution; and it is a rule of historical retribution that its
      instrument be forged not by the offended, but by the offender himself.”<sup class="calibre13" id="noteh--54"><a class="calibre14" id="notehfn4"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#notehfn4-r" id="noteh--56">4</a></sup> Incidentally, the content
      of Marx’s article is a denunciation of British atrocities in India, brimming with “empathy or sympathetic
      attachment” to the oppressed people under attack.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="noteh--57">
      2. The second item of documentation concerns the split in the Communist League of September 15, 1850, which we
      have already covered from several aspects.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="noteh--58">
      There is an introductory clause: “Much as Marx always opposed …” It sounds as if it is giving Marx due credit for
      something. One sees that Marx opposed socialists who tried to “dissociate” themselves from the proletariat—the
      farthest he went in “spiritual attachment”—and it appears he opposed only those who did so “explicitly.” There is
      no documentation.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="noteh--59">
      The nub of this item is Avineri’s flat assertion that “a chief reason for the split … was Marx’s uncertainty
      about what would happen to the League if it were to be exclusively proletarian in membership.” There is no
      documentation for this statement. We have stressed, of course, that Marx always opposed proletarian exclusionism;
      what we need is enlightenment about this unexplained “uncertainty,” and some <a class="calibre6" id="page_639"></a>evidence that
      this undocumented uncertainty was “a” chief reason for the split, or had anything to do with it.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="noteh--61">
      While Avineri offers no documentation, the reliable documents about this episode are known and not
      voluminous.<sup class="calibre13" id="noteh--62"><a class="calibre14" id="notehfn5"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#notehfn5-r" id="noteh--64">5</a></sup> There is nothing in them that has any more resemblance to Avineri’s assertion
      than the footnote about French nobles and Indian sepoys has to the fabricated “remark.” There is no record that
      Marx worried about “what would happen to the League if it were to be exclusively proletarian in
      membership”—though any responsible leader should have done so—and so we have no more idea than Avineri about the
      nonexistent content of this fabricated remark. The second fiction is that Marx was “uncertain” about this
      unraised question—though it is hard to imagine that anyone could be “certain” about it. The third fiction is that
      this invented uncertainty was any reason for the split, whose reasons we know fairly well.<a class="calibre6" id="notehen2-r"></a><a class="nounder1" href="43.html#notehen2" id="noteh--66">*</a>
</div>
<div class="indent" id="noteh--67">
      3. The next piece of evidence refers to what Marx’s opponents “went so far as to accuse” Marx of, namely, “trying
      to impose intellectual discipline on the proletarian movement.” Avineri, as a responsible scholar, now provides
      us with a footnote, which refers to certain pages containing part of the minutes of the September 15 meeting.
      Unfortunately there is nothing whatever in these pages about this accusation or anything similar.<sup class="calibre13" id="noteh--68"><a class="calibre14" id="notehfn9"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#notehfn9-r" id="noteh--70">9</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="indent" id="noteh--71">
      Still, there must have been accusations flying around in all directions, like the dishes heaved by the Duchess’
      cook, since no split <a class="calibre6" id="page_640"></a>discussion is complete without them. Instead of speculating about what
      Avineri might have had in mind (like subsequent spates of slander) we must ask what this has to do with
      “documenting” Marx’s alleged views about intellectuals. The interesting thing is not what gossip the
      sectarians-in-a-frenzy “went so far” as to spread, if any, but what factual basis Avineri has for bringing up
      this trash. Plainly, if he is going to devote a total of fifteen lines (plus footnotes) to Marx’s lifetime views
      on the proletariat, it is odd to devote twenty percent of this space to unspecified gossip by unidentified
      factionalists about unmentioned crimes.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="noteh--73">
      But still, the question is somehow raised about “intellectual discipline on the proletarian movement.” It is not
      a question of Marx’s views, which are not adduced by Avineri, but of charges made by his opponents. If this
      injection of the question has any relevance, it must be because the Schapper-Willich group <em class="calibre8" id="noteh--74">opposed</em> such discipline. Did they? While we do not know what “intellectual” discipline means
      here exactly, we can be sure that the Schapper-Willich group was strongly in favor of a superdisciplined
      organization, for they were (theoretically) getting ready to sally forth into Tooley Street at any moment in
      order to overthrow every European government in sight. Willich’s plan was essentially to pounce on Germany with
      an elite brigade of five thousand well-organized bravos chosen from “the People of the Lord”—so Engels described
      it in a letter to Marx without much exaggeration.<sup class="calibre13" id="noteh--75"><a class="calibre14" id="notehfn10"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#notehfn10-r" id="noteh--77">10</a></sup> Willich was a military martinet by training and nature, and
      leaned to barracks discipline, not simply “intellectual discipline.”
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="noteh--78">
      Avineri’s unexplained phrase suggests <em class="calibre8" id="noteh--79">discipline by intellectuals</em> over hapless
      proletarians writhing in their sinister grip; but this well-known scenario was not played out in the split. It
      was the Schapper-Willich sect that, following the separation, adopted formal statutes abandoning the democratic
      setup Marx had insisted on for the Communist League, and establishing a <em class="calibre8" id="noteh--80">dictatorship of the
      Central Committee</em> in so many words, that is, the dictatorship of the ex-student Schapper and the ex-military
      martinet Willich.<sup class="calibre13" id="noteh--81"><a class="calibre14" id="notehfn11"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#notehfn11-r" id="noteh--83">11</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="indent" id="noteh--84">
      4. Avineri’s second footnote, which we have seen is mistaken about the first part of the sentence it is hung on,
      is also attached to the final revelation: that Marx sometimes “snubbed” Wilhelm Weitling as “the Tailors’ King.”
      Before we ask what this climactic offense means, let us note that the reader need not look into the footnoted
      pages of the Marx-Engels <em class="calibre8" id="noteh--85">Werke</em> for Avineri’s reference: there is no more to be found
      there on this point than on the other. Weitling was not even mentioned in the split discussion, nor was he
      involved in the situation; he had lost all influence in the League over three years previously.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="noteh--86">
<a class="calibre6" id="page_641"></a>The historic snub can be explored only as an adventure in irrelevance. The reader may assume
      that “Tailors’ King” was a simple insult. The tag “King of the Tailors” referred historically to John of Leyden,
      the leader of the Anabaptist rebels in the Reformation, one of the primitive communists in the pantheon of the
      movement. When Weitling’s critics applied the label to him, it was a sarcastic thrust at his pretensions to be a
      Great Man, a notorious failing of his. (See Engels’ remarks on this in his history of the Communist
      League,<sup class="calibre13" id="noteh--88"><a class="calibre14" id="notehfn12"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#notehfn12-r" id="noteh--90">12</a></sup> and Marx’s application of the label to Schweitzer.) Since Avineri inserts this
      tidbit without explanation, it is hard to say whether he thinks the “snub” consisted in calling Weitling a
      tailor; but of course, on the contrary, Weitling flaunted his (former) trade as a political banner—it made him a
      Certified Worker. The John of Leyden title was a rather mild jibe at overpretentions in a movement which, after
      1847, had come to see Weitling as an obsolete figure, increasingly pathetic. But even this jibe had nothing
      special to do with Marx; it appears to have been common coin. Weitling’s American biographer and admirer, Wittke,
      refers to him in this way in passing; or perhaps Wittke is quoting Weydemeyer (or Marx).<sup class="calibre13" id="noteh--91"><a class="calibre14" id="notehfn13"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#notehfn13-r" id="noteh--93">13</a></sup> Marx
      certainly used this catch-phrase about Weitling on at least one occasion: in a letter to Engels in 1853,
      commenting on the slanders printed in Weitling’s U.S. paper on the victims of the then recent Cologne Communist
      trial, Marx mentioned “the poison spread by this King of the Tailors and dictator of the Communia [utopian]
      colony.”<sup class="calibre13" id="noteh--94"><a class="calibre14" id="notehfn14"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#notehfn14-r" id="noteh--96">14</a></sup> For Weitling did indeed blossom out as a full-fledged dictator as soon as he
      got something to dictate to, in line with his firm principles in favor of a messianic dictatorship<sup class="calibre13" id="noteh--97"><a class="calibre14" id="notehfn15"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#notehfn15-r" id="noteh--99">15</a></sup>—just
      as John of Leyden became dictator over the Anabaptist community in Münster. One wonders whether Avineri got the
      point of Marx’s analogy between the two Tailor Kings.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="noteh--100">
      Whatever all this means, where or how Marx “snubbed” Weitling with this derisive label is a portentous event that
      research reveals not. Yet, without this information, how do we know whether this historic snubbery does or does
      not prove that Marx held the “sceptical view of the proletariat’s ability [etc.]” which Avineri’s documentation
      has not yet documented?
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="noteh--101">
      Finally, there is the implication that Marx’s snubbing of Weitling was a blow against the proletariat because
      Weitling was an honest-to-goodness proletarian. Leaving the non sequitur aside, our Special Note I gives
      information on Weitling’s actual class role and pretensions to intellectual dictatorship.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="noteh--102">
      5. And now to the <em class="calibre8" id="noteh--103">asses.</em> In his second footnote, hard on the mistaken reference to the
      <em class="calibre8" id="noteh--104">Werke</em>, Avineri introduces a new indictment, <a class="calibre6" id="page_642"></a>citing a letter by
      Marx. This new reference contains as many mistakes as it has lines.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="noteh--106">
      First: the quotation ascribed to Marx (“Asses more stupid than these German workers …”) was not written by Marx.
      It appeared in the middle of a report <em class="calibre8" id="noteh--107">to</em> Marx on the increasingly tense situation in
      Cologne, where the witchhunt trial was going to take place, by a Communist League member named A. Bermbach. Marx
      then sent the report on to Engels, in the letter which Avineri cites.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="noteh--108">
      Second: this letter—which Avineri thinks was “carefully” omitted from the <em class="calibre8" id="noteh--109">Werke</em> because
      of this dreadful statement about asinine workers—appears in the <em class="calibre8" id="noteh--110">Werke</em> in all its glory,
      but under a corrected date.<sup class="calibre13" id="noteh--111"><a class="calibre14" id="notehfn16"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#notehfn16-r" id="noteh--113">16</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="indentb" id="noteh--114">
      Third: although Avineri unfortunately seized on a remark about <em class="calibre8" id="noteh--115">asses</em> which was by
      somebody else, there is little difficulty in finding real invective by Marx about certified proletarians as
      “asses” and worse—and also about members of every other class, nation, party, race, creed, and color.

</div>
<div class="indentb" id="noteh--123">
      As a service to marxology, I suggest that Avineri’s gaffe about Bermbach’s report should be replaced with, say,

      We now return to Avineri’s assurance that Marx’s “sceptical view” about the proletariat “has often been
      documented.” In response to my query asking where this documentation might be found,<sup class="calibre13" id="noteh--138"><a class="calibre14" id="notehfn20"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#notehfn20-r" id="noteh--140">20</a></sup> Professor <a class="calibre6" id="page_643"></a>Avineri kindly referred me to his article on “Marx and the Intellectuals,” published shortly
      before his book. This disabused me of the notion that he had meant documentation by other marxologists; for the
      article offers only “documentation” by Marx, for a thesis involving “intellectual help” by intellectuals.<sup class="calibre13" id="noteh--142"><a class="calibre14" id="notehfn21"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#notehfn21-r" id="noteh--144">21</a></sup> If
      we limit ourselves to documentation in a literal sense (not argumentation), then what in Marx constitutes
      Avineri’s documentation?

<div class="indent" id="noteh--145">
      With one exception—the case of Eccarius which is the subject of the next section—we have already taken up all of
      his documentation elsewhere:
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="noteh--146">
      1. Marx’s recorded opposition to the <em class="calibre8" id="noteh--147">exclusion</em> of nonworkers from the International and
      the proletarian movement. This proves the workers need “help.”
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="noteh--148">
      2. Marx’s expressions of “disdain, if not outright contempt, for those leaders of the movement who were
      themselves of working-class origin … a certain intellectual <em class="calibre8" id="noteh--149">hauteur</em> is clearly visible
      in his comments.” No comments are specified, except the “Tailors’ King” snub to Weitling. (Eccarius is mentioned
      in this connection.) Ignored are Marx’s expressions of admiration for some leaders of working-class origin, like
      Bebel, and of disdain (or even <em class="calibre8" id="noteh--150">hauteur</em>) for a vast array of leaders of nonworker origin.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="noteh--151">
      3. The 1870 letter by Engels which we quoted elsewhere,<sup class="calibre13" id="noteh--152"><a class="calibre14" id="notehfn22"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#notehfn22-r" id="noteh--154">22</a></sup> about the supply of intellectuals in the
      socialist movement. Avineri does not explain why he finds this letter offensive.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="noteh--155">
      4. And finally, we are back with the <em class="calibre8" id="noteh--156">asses.</em> The Marx-Engels correspondence, says
      Avineri, is full of “allusions to the workers’ intellectual limitations, stupidity, and narrowmindedness,”
      sometimes even using such derogatory terms as “ ‘asses,’ <em class="calibre8" id="noteh--157">‘Knoten</em>,’ ‘<em class="calibre8" id="noteh--158">Straubinger</em>.’ ” If he had added that it is full of such derogation (and worse) about all other
      kinds of people, he would at last have made a completely accurate statement. Then, with the Clown in <em class="calibre8" id="noteh--159">Twelfth Night</em>, we could give its definitive justification:
    </div>
<div class="bqi" id="noteh--160">

      There is no documentation, not a footnote; no further explanation; just a magisterial sentence, summing up a
      quarter century of Marx-Eccarius relations. Eccarius is declared a totally innocent victim of Marx’s galloping
      disdain for workers, or perhaps for tailors. Let the reader now find out what is behind this scholarly judgment.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="noteh--170">
      We would hesitate to devote a few pages to this story, except that there are two other objectives to be gained,
      as bonuses. A number of marxologists (not Avineri) have repeated the myth that Marx broke with all of his
      friends, being something of an inhuman monster. We will, in passing, see how this inhuman monster treated his
      loyal follower. And in the course, we will see Marx in an unaccustomed light, I think.

<div class="indent" id="noteh--174">
      Johann Georg (in England, John George) Eccarius was born in Thuringia in 1818, became a tailor, and emigrated to
      London as a young man. He became a member of the League of the Just, which reorganized itself as the Communist
      League; a member of the League’s executive; a leader of its front organization, the German Workers Educational
      Society; and an active trade-unionist, elected a member of the London Trades Council. In the course, though
      laboring under difficult financial conditions, often poor and sick, he educated himself, and became a talented
      writer in two languages. His real talent and thinking ability encouraged his burning ambition to get ahead as a
      writer; but it was Marx who encouraged him most of all.
    </div>
<div class="indentb" id="noteh--175">
      Marx gave him his first chance to publish: Eccarius’ article on “Tailoring in London or The Struggle Between
      Large and Small Capital” appeared in his London magazine <em class="calibre8" id="noteh--176">NRZ Revue</em> in 1850. Marx helped
      him write the article, edited it, and probably formulated some <a class="calibre6" id="page_645"></a>of the passages; and then
      presented it to the public with a special blare of trumpets, which we have already partly quoted elsewhere:
    </div>
<div class="bqi2" id="noteh--178">
      The author of this article is himself a <em class="calibre8" id="noteh--179">worker</em> in one of the London tailor shops. We ask
      the German bourgeoisie how many writers they have who are capable of comprehending the actual development in
      similar fashion.

      The reader will note how, instead of the sentimental-moral and psychological critique such as <em class="calibre8" id="noteh--182">Weitling</em> and other worker-writers bring out against existing conditions, here a purely
      materialist and free conception, undistorted by emotional grumbling, confronts bourgeois society and its
      development.<sup class="calibre13" id="noteh--183"><a class="calibre14" id="notehfn23"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#notehfn23-r" id="noteh--185">23</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="noindentt" id="noteh--186">
      The pride displayed here is a political statement. Eccarius became a collaborator on the magazine, and Marx
      planned to have him write other articles.<sup class="calibre13" id="noteh--187"><a class="calibre14" id="notehfn24"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#notehfn24-r" id="noteh--189">24</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="indent" id="noteh--190">
      When the split in the Communist League came in September, Eccarius ranged himself with Marx. After the split he
      worked to counteract the Schapper-Willich group’s influence in the League and to help the Communists prosecuted
      in the Cologne witchhunt trial.<sup class="calibre13" id="noteh--191"><a class="calibre14" id="notehfn25"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#notehfn25-r" id="noteh--193">25</a></sup> In the dark days of the 1850s he became part of the very small circle of
      coworkers and cothinkers around Marx, especially as a writer.<sup class="calibre13" id="noteh--194"><a class="calibre14" id="notehfn26"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#notehfn26-r" id="noteh--196">26</a></sup> More: he became a family friend.<sup class="calibre13" id="noteh--197"><a class="calibre14" id="notehfn27"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#notehfn27-r" id="noteh--199">27</a></sup>
      When he fell ill, Marx wrote to Engels: “poor Eccarius has come down with consumption. This is the most tragic
      thing I’ve lived to see here in London”<sup class="calibre13" id="noteh--200"><a class="calibre14" id="notehfn28"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#notehfn28-r" id="noteh--202">28</a></sup>—this when Marx’s own personal affairs were often as grim. In
      other letters Marx stressed that “poor Eccarius” was breaking down under the conditions of his “tailor shop
      hell.”<sup class="calibre13" id="noteh--203"><a class="calibre14" id="notehfn29"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#notehfn29-r" id="noteh--205">29</a></sup> So that Eccarius could quit tailoring under doctor’s orders, Marx at his own
      expense (of course with Engels’ assistance) rented lodgings for him near his own home so that he could eat with
      the Marx family. Thus Eccarius was set up to devoting his full time to taking care of his health, and writing
      articles for the German-American press at three dollars an article. When his health improved, Marx and Engels
      tried unsuccessfully to get him a tailoring job in Manchester, instead of his going back to the “stink tank” in
      London where he had broken down. When his children died of scarlet fever, they collected a fund for him.<sup class="calibre13" id="noteh--206"><a class="calibre14" id="notehfn30"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#notehfn30-r" id="noteh--208">30</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="indent" id="noteh--209">
      At the same time, Marx was helping to train Eccarius as a writer, revising and correcting his articles.<sup class="calibre13" id="noteh--210"><a class="calibre14" id="notehfn31"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#notehfn31-r" id="noteh--212">31</a></sup> To
      an American comrade Marx explained why Eccarius’ production was limited: “Eccarius has to tailor from five in the
      morning till eight in the evening and is in a serious condition.” Therefore, urged Marx (whose own family was
      living from <a class="calibre6" id="page_646"></a>hand to mouth), Eccarius had first priority on payment: “If they will pay
      <em class="calibre8" id="noteh--214">money</em>, I am for Eccarius’ getting something first, so that he doesn’t need to tailor all
      day. In accordance with an arrangement with me, he is now to send regular correspondence. Do what you can to see
      he gets <em class="calibre8" id="noteh--215">something</em>.”<sup class="calibre13" id="noteh--216"><a class="calibre14" id="notehfn32"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#notehfn32-r" id="noteh--218">32</a></sup> Poor Eccarius came first.
    </div>
<div class="indentb" id="noteh--219">
      A curious incident supervened during these years, prefiguring Avineri. In his 1852-1853 pamphlet <em class="calibre8" id="noteh--220">Revelations on the Communist Trial in Cologne</em> Marx had given a detailed account of complex
      goings-on which included the following incidental sentence: “Not long before the Cologne court proceedings,
      Kinkel and Willich sent a journeyman tailor as emissary to Germany.”<sup class="calibre13" id="noteh--221"><a class="calibre14" id="notehfn33"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#notehfn33-r" id="noteh--223">33</a></sup> <em class="calibre8" id="noteh--224">Aha!</em> thundered Willich from America in the course of slander-filled articles: “Why does Herr
      Marx emphasize <em class="calibre8" id="noteh--225">journeyman tailor?”</em> There had been no emphasis. Marx actually had to
      explain that it was the simplest way to identify the man without giving his name publicly. And he added:
    </div>
<div class="bq" id="noteh--226">
      [Willich] thus charges me with high treason to journeymen tailors collectively, and seeks to assure himself of
      their votes by a Pindarjc ode on journeymen tailors. Out of consideration for the good name of journeymen
      tailors, he is generously silent about the fact that Eccarius, whom he had labeled one of the pariahs, is a
      journeyman tailor, which has not so far prevented Eccarius from becoming one of the greatest thinkers of the
      German proletariat and gaining a position of authority among the Chartists by his English articles in the <em class="calibre8" id="noteh--227">Red Republican</em>, in <em class="calibre8" id="noteh--228">Notes to the People</em>, and in the <em class="calibre8" id="noteh--229">People</em>’s <em class="calibre8" id="noteh--230">Paper</em>.<sup class="calibre13" id="noteh--231"><a class="calibre14" id="notehfn34"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#notehfn34-r" id="noteh--233">34</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="noindentt" id="noteh--234">
      We note the same pride, with the same political content. In fact Marx, as he pushed Eccarius’ reputation,
      habitually identified him as a worker, to make clear he was not just another littérateur.<sup class="calibre13" id="noteh--235"><a class="calibre14" id="notehfn35"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#notehfn35-r" id="noteh--237">35</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="indent" id="noteh--238">
      When the dark years ended, Marx had a right to think that his investment of friendship and time in Eccarius was
      going to pay off for the movement. And for a while it did. The big break came with the founding meeting of the
      International in St. Martin’s Hall, in 1864. One of the French émigrés came to Marx to ask him to speak and also
      to “supply a German worker” as a speaker. “I supplied them with Eccarius, who made an excellent showing,” Marx
      wrote Engels; Marx stayed mute on the platform.<sup class="calibre13" id="noteh--239"><a class="calibre14" id="notehfn36"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#notehfn36-r" id="noteh--241">36</a></sup> Both Eccarius and Marx were elected to the General Council.
      From here on, Eccarius worked closely with Marx in the International and, after his mentor, was the most
      important German in its leadership.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="noteh--242">
      It seems clear that without Marx to back him up Eccarius would not have lasted long in the General Council.
      Collins and Abramsky, in their valuable work <em class="calibre8" id="noteh--243">Karl Marx and the British Labour Movement</em>,
      think that his “tactless,” “clumsy and over-sensitive” personality was a big negative <a class="calibre6" id="page_647"></a>factor. “It is certain that throughout his entire career in the International Eccarius was a
      controversial figure, disliked by the English members of the General Council against whom Marx had frequently to
      defend him …” Only part of this hostility was veiled hostility to Marx by certain members; Collins-Abramsky add:
      “A man gifted with subtlety and finesse might have negotiated such difficulties; Eccarius who was humorless and
      gauche in the extreme probably exacerbated them.”<sup class="calibre13" id="noteh--245"><a class="calibre14" id="notehfn37"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#notehfn37-r" id="noteh--247">37</a></sup> For that matter, as time went on Eccarius also
      increasingly alienated his German coworkers, like Lochner, Lessner, Pfänder and Jung.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="noteh--248">
      Marx alone, as far as the record shows, saw no flaws in Eccarius.<a class="calibre6" id="notehen4-r"></a><a class="nounder1" href="43.html#notehen4" id="noteh--250">*</a> Engels agreed that Eccarius was the man to take over the leadership of
      the German movement if only he would leave London.<sup class="calibre13" id="noteh--251"><a class="calibre14" id="notehfn39"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#notehfn39-r" id="noteh--253">39</a></sup> When the International, crowning Marx’s efforts, was
      successful in helping to establish the Reform League (for universal suffrage), Eccarius was made one of its
      officers,<sup class="calibre13" id="noteh--254"><a class="calibre14" id="notehfn40"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#notehfn40-r" id="noteh--256">40</a></sup> pushed by Marx. Marx wrote admiringly of his protégé’s ability as an election
      campaigner.<sup class="calibre13" id="noteh--257"><a class="calibre14" id="notehfn41"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#notehfn41-r" id="noteh--259">41</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="indentb" id="noteh--260">
      Then the English kicked back, as Eccarius’ ambitions outran discretion. The editorship of the <em class="calibre8" id="noteh--261">Workman’s Advocate</em>, renamed <em class="calibre8" id="noteh--262">Commonwealth</em> opened up in 1866, and three
      influential trade-union leaders wanted the job; so did Eccarius. So great was the respect for Marx in
      International circles that his influence was enough to get the lowly German tailor appointed over the others.
      Resentment against Eccarius boiled over.<sup class="calibre13" id="noteh--263"><a class="calibre14" id="notehfn42"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#notehfn42-r" id="noteh--265">42</a></sup> Marx had second thoughts about his headlong support to
      Eccarius’ ambitions, and for the first time voiced an inkling (to Engels) about his friend’s “egoism”:
    </div>
<div class="bq" id="noteh--266">
      On my part it was a “political” mistake to yield to his pressure and propose him for the post … I knew in advance
      that the thing would fall on my back. Avoidance of any appearance of personal aims or misuse of personal
      influence for secret ends, and good collaboration with the English, must of course be more important for us than
      the satisfaction of Eccarius’ more or less justified ambition.
    </div>
<div class="noindentt" id="noteh--267">
<a class="calibre6" id="page_648"></a>“Dry natures like Eccarius’,” he wrote, “possess a certain dry egoism also, which easily
      leads them astray.” And then, rather meditatively, he described a previous occasion when, against Marx’s warning,
      Eccarius had pushed himself too fast, and come a cropper.
    </div>
<div class="bq" id="noteh--269">
      The poor fellow has, of course, had a life of disappointments, and the honorary posts that the English
      spontaneously granted him, like vice-president of the International, etc., misled him so much that he now thought
      he could have revenge all at once for his whole past life. If he had heeded me, operated slowly, maintained a
      modest attitude, everything would have gone best. If, despite his lack of [self-] discipline and his headstrong
      pushing, I myself even went into the muck on his behalf, 1 was particularly induced to do so out of the
      consideration that he had always worked with us and never reaped any fruits. But one always makes blunders if one
      lets oneself be influenced by such considerations.<sup class="calibre13" id="noteh--270"><a class="calibre14" id="notehfn43"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#notehfn43-r" id="noteh--272">43</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="indentt" id="noteh--273">
      But this brought about no change in Marx’s relations with Eccarius; Marx blamed himself as much as Eccarius for
      this episode. Soon afterwards Marx helped Eccarius produce his most important work to date, a series of articles
      on the political economy of John Stuart Mill, first published in <em class="calibre8" id="noteh--274">Commonwealth</em>, and then
      as a brochure in Germany.<sup class="calibre13" id="noteh--275"><a class="calibre14" id="notehfn44"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#notehfn44-r" id="noteh--277">44</a></sup> The study “was written with mighty assistance and coaching by Marx,” related
      Engels later, with “whole pages” at the end being written by Marx himself, especially in more theoretical
      passages.<sup class="calibre13" id="noteh--278"><a class="calibre14" id="notehfn45"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#notehfn45-r" id="noteh--280">45</a></sup> Marx’s help was secret; Eccarius reaped considerable prestige, of

</div>
<div class="indent" id="noteh--284">
      In the General Council, Marx’s continued support of Eccarius paid off for the latter. In July 1867 Eccarius was
      named general secretary. His literary ambitions also flowered: the <em class="calibre8" id="noteh--285">Times</em> itself took him
      on as correspondent to report on the Lausanne congress of the International. Marx approved mightily, for he
      expected that Eccarius’ dispatches, carefully formulated, would be good publicity for the International (as they
      were indeed).<sup class="calibre13" id="noteh--286"><a class="calibre14" id="notehfn47"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#notehfn47-r" id="noteh--288">47</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="indent" id="noteh--289">
      What Eccarius’ dispatches to the <em class="calibre8" id="noteh--290">Times</em> did besides was to scandalize International
      circles by their crude ridicule of the French (Proudhonist) delegation particularly. To Marx Eccarius claimed
      that the <em class="calibre8" id="noteh--291">Times</em> had rewritten his copy, and Marx swallowed this claim whole. “The <em class="calibre8" id="noteh--292">Times</em> shamefully blue-pencils Eccarius’ articles,” Marx informed Engels indignantly. He
      (Eccarius) should have realized that the “bourgeois editors” would exploit his “humorous” references to the
      French in order to ridicule the International; but (Marx enjoined Engels) we must keep Eccarius’ authorship
      secret, because “The way they edited his stories could do him enormous damage.” The trouble with this
      worker-writer, <a class="calibre6" id="page_649"></a>Marx lamented, was lack of “diplomatic skill.”<sup class="calibre13" id="noteh--294"><a class="calibre14" id="notehfn48"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#notehfn48-r" id="noteh--296">48</a></sup> But it was not
      possible to keep Eccarius’ authorship secret (I suspect Eccarius did not). On the General Council, Peter Fox
      launched an assault on Eccarius’ dispatches, and only because of Marx’s vigorous defense and counterattack did

      defended Eccarius against his English critics and the affair subsided.” Writing to Engels about his energetic
      battle to save Eccarius’ hide, Marx nevertheless added: “Still, during the debate Eccarius got hauled over the
      coals good and proper.”<sup class="calibre13" id="noteh--300"><a class="calibre14" id="notehfn50"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#notehfn50-r" id="noteh--302">50</a></sup> He hoped it would be a lesson.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="noteh--303">
      Even while Marx did this, he knew that, just before this, Eccarius had shafted Marx himself in a somewhat similar
      way; it was in a report Eccarius had written for the <em class="calibre8" id="noteh--304">Bee-Hive</em> on a General Council
      discussion about the Geneva Peace Congress. Marx had made an important speech for a half hour; yet Eccarius’
      report dismissed it with “a couple of phrases” (so Marx wrote to Engels).<sup class="calibre13" id="noteh--305"><a class="calibre14" id="notehfn51"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#notehfn51-r" id="noteh--307">51</a></sup> We will see what this
      signified about Eccarius, but at the time it seemed to be just another incomprehensible blunder.
    </div>
<div class="indentb" id="noteh--308">
      A year later, Eccarius’ congress reports for the <em class="calibre8" id="noteh--309">Times</em> stirred a violent storm, because
      of a self-serving crudity so transparent as to lay his character bare to most. While the denunciations flew, Marx
      sent Engels a cool summary of the charges against Eccarius (all true):
    </div>
<div class="bqi" id="noteh--310">
      He [Eccarius] took almost <em class="calibre8" id="noteh--311">no part</em> in the Congress and afterwards presented himself in
      the <em class="calibre8" id="noteh--312">Times</em> as the °leading mind.° There he appropriated the <em class="calibre8" id="noteh--313">General
      Council proposals</em> as his private property, and ditto the applause bestowed on them as if it were directed to
      him. He suppressed the speeches <em class="calibre8" id="noteh--314">of the others</em> as much as possible and, in order to
      flatter the <em class="calibre8" id="noteh--315">Times, falsified</em> Dupont’s concluding speech. Lessner, furthermore, has the
      grievance that when he (Lessner) read passages from my book [<em class="calibre8" id="noteh--316">Capital</em>] Eccarius
      suppressed this fact in the <em class="calibre8" id="noteh--317">Times;</em> ditto, his dispatches included the resolution on the
      book [recommending <em class="calibre8" id="noteh--318">Capital</em> to workers] only under °high pressure°; finally, he falsified
      the German resolution on war….<sup class="calibre13" id="noteh--319"><a class="calibre14" id="notehfn52"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#notehfn52-r" id="noteh--321">52</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="noindent" id="noteh--322">
      The only question was what to do about him, or to him; fury was general. Marx informed Engels: “I shall try to
      protect Eccarius against ‘positive’ measures, but this time I cannot come out for him so partisanly as I did last
      year …”<sup class="calibre13" id="noteh--323"><a class="calibre14" id="notehfn53"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#notehfn53-r" id="noteh--325">53</a></sup> When the storm broke over Eccarius’ head at the General Council, the minutes
      (which Eccarius as general secretary tried to suppress) inform us that his only defense was that “it was by
      mistake because he was so much confused.” Lafargue answered flatly that he did not believe it. But one notes in
      the minutes that Marx <a class="calibre6" id="page_650"></a>then moved to pass on, and the meeting dropped the subject.<sup class="calibre13" id="noteh--327"><a class="calibre14" id="notehfn54"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#notehfn54-r" id="noteh--329">54</a></sup> As
      he had indicated, Marx was trying to run interference for poor Eccarius without defending what he had done.
    </div>
<div class="indentb" id="noteh--330">
      Marx did not fail to understand how Eccarius had tried to shaft him (Marx) personally and what he was up to; he
      was hoping that poor Eccarius could be reformed and his talents saved. To a mutual friend he let his hair down
      and explained why Eccarius had suppressed mention of <em class="calibre8" id="noteh--331">Capital</em> more than once:
    </div>
<div class="bq" id="noteh--332">
      Eccarius, who is otherwise very sound, but at the same time very ambitious, has, in <em class="calibre8" id="noteh--333">Commonwealth</em> and on other occasions, <em class="calibre8" id="noteh--334">purposely refrained</em> from
      mentioning it. He likes to appropriate my theoretical work for <em class="calibre8" id="noteh--335">himself</em>.<a class="calibre6" id="notehen5-r"></a><a class="nounder1" href="43.html#notehen5" id="noteh--337">*</a> At the Brussels congress
      Lessner in his speech on the machinery question spoke of <em class="calibre8" id="noteh--338">my book.</em> The correspondent of
      the <em class="calibre8" id="noteh--339">Daily News</em> reported it. Eccarius, reporting the congress sessions for the <em class="calibre8" id="noteh--340">Times, suppressed</em> it. His goings-on are so much the sillier since he not only owes his
      knowledge to me but also his post as general secretary in the General Council. I alone supported him (in the
      <em class="calibre8" id="noteh--341">Commonwealth</em> too) against the attacks from the English and French sides. He is relying
      on the experiences he has gone through to see to it that I keep my eye only on the cause and shut my eyes to
      personal stupidities!<sup class="calibre13" id="noteh--342"><a class="calibre14" id="notehfn56"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#notehfn56-r" id="noteh--344">56</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="noindentt" id="noteh--345">
      Marx added elsewhere: “His egoism needs a °puff [blow] to set him right again.°”<sup class="calibre13" id="noteh--346"><a class="calibre14" id="notehfn57"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#notehfn57-r" id="noteh--348">57</a></sup> One might think that
      by this time Marx would have given up on poor Eccarius; on the contrary, we will see him continue to push
      Eccarius into new posts!
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="noteh--349">
      In any case, over two decades of this relationship have passed, and our inhuman monster (Marx) has not yet
      brought himself to see the truth about Eccarius, let alone offend him with expressions of disdain and <em class="calibre8" id="noteh--350">hauteur.</em>
</div>
<div class="indentb" id="noteh--351">
      We get a glimpse of Eccarius’ way with Marx in another letter by Marx around this time, again to a mutual friend.
      Someone (quite possibly Eccarius himself) was spreading the word of a break between him and Marx. This is a
      misunderstanding, wrote Marx:
    </div>
<div class="bq" id="noteh--352">
      … on the contrary, <em class="calibre8" id="noteh--353">to date</em> I have upheld him against the attacks of the English, etc.
      But <em class="calibre8" id="noteh--354">he</em> —his overweening and often narrow egoism perhaps developed as a result of his
      circumstances—commits unpleasant stupidities from time to time. For the most <a class="calibre6" id="page_651"></a>part I take no
      notice of them. By exception my patience gives way. Then I give him a dressing-down, and °all is right again till
      the next time. The poor devil is now very sick, and he always uses such times to say his <em class="calibre8" id="noteh--356">pater peccavi</em> [Father, I have sinned].<sup class="calibre13" id="noteh--357"><a class="calibre14" id="notehfn58"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#notehfn58-r" id="noteh--359">58</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="noindent" id="noteh--360">
      In fact Marx was still absurdly soft on the poor devil. Writing to his friend Dr. Kugelmann about the
      worker-philosopher Dietzgen, Marx seized the occasion to vaunt about—Eccarius. “I always had an inkling that he
      [Dietzgen] was ‘not a worker like Eccarius,’” he wrote.<sup class="calibre13" id="noteh--361"><a class="calibre14" id="notehfn59"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#notehfn59-r" id="noteh--363">59</a></sup> In the course of 1869 we learn incidentally
      that he is still helping Eccarius out financially from his own pocket.<sup class="calibre13" id="noteh--364"><a class="calibre14" id="notehfn60"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#notehfn60-r" id="noteh--366">60</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="indent" id="noteh--367">
      Although Eccarius was still working for the <em class="calibre8" id="noteh--368">Times</em> (which, we learn, “gave him great
      praise and made him lucrative offers”<sup class="calibre13" id="noteh--369"><a class="calibre14" id="notehfn61"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#notehfn61-r" id="noteh--371">61</a></sup>), his dispatches on the Basel Congress of 1869 launched no
      new scandal; Marx’s dressing-downs had apparently had effect. But we must pause at a new vignette of Eccarius’
      vaulting egoism at work: at the congress (reported Lessner to Marx) he went around asking every foreigner whether
      he had heard of Eccarius!<sup class="calibre13" id="noteh--372"><a class="calibre14" id="notehfn62"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#notehfn62-r" id="noteh--374">62</a></sup> The ambitious man’s egoism was so gigantic and so unconcealed that in another
      milieu it might have been accounted a mere quirk.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="noteh--375">
      No new storm having broken out over Eccarius for a while, Marx reverted to his previous course of collaboration
      with and help to him. When another International project, the Land and Labor League (for land nationalization)
      was established in October 1869, Eccarius was appointed one of the joint secretaries—a paid job,<sup class="calibre13" id="noteh--376"><a class="calibre14" id="notehfn63"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#notehfn63-r" id="noteh--378">63</a></sup>
      hence a plum that only Marx could have got for him. It is plain from the Marx-Engels correspondence that Marx was
      collaborating with him as closely as ever.<sup class="calibre13" id="noteh--379"><a class="calibre14" id="notehfn64"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#notehfn64-r" id="noteh--381">64</a></sup> <em class="calibre8" id="noteh--382">And this went on for another two
      years.</em> As late as November 1871, when Eccarius was already almost visibly going over to the hate-Marx
      faction as the International bogged down in the mire of factional warfare, Marx still persuaded the General
      Council to appoint Eccarius as secretary for the United States—a post he promptly proceeded to use to knife both
      Marx and the Council.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="noteh--383">
      But by this time the subjects we have set ourselves—Avineri’s thesis or the Marx-monster fairy tale—are no longer
      relevant. In the course of a few months, as the International disintegrated politically, Eccarius formally and
      consciously went over to the camp of the English trade-union bureaucracy that was getting into bourgeois politics
      as the lib-lab wing of the Liberal Party. In this course his rites of passage included inciting its enemies
      against the General Council and bedding down with the anarchists for a short period in a rump International
      united only by common opposition to independent labor politics. It is not disdain and <em class="calibre8" id="noteh--384">hauteur</em> that Marx could now possibly express about this poor devil <a class="calibre6" id="page_652"></a>turned
      renegade, but rather furious denunciation of him as a simple turncoat, scamp, and traitor.
    </div>
<div class="indentb" id="noteh--386">
      Only one key incident needs to be exhumed from oblivion: the point where Eccarius broke with Marx. Yes, it was
      Eccarius who decided to kick Marx demonstratively in the face, by sending a curt business note addressing him as
      “Dear Sir,” and written in English, that is, as a stranger. It was already May 1872, and Eccarius was far gone;
      but Marx had not given up hope for him. On receiving this billet-doux from Eccarius, the Marx-monster actually
      sent an immediate letter pleading with him not to be a fool and forget about it all!
    </div>
<div class="bq" id="noteh--387">
         You seem to have become foolish [Marx wrote], and since for the present I still consider this seizure of yours
      as transitory, you will allow me for the present to address you neither as Sir, nor Herr, nor Domine, and to
      write you in German instead of English.
    </div>
<div class="noindenttb" id="noteh--388">
      Our monster then reminded Eccarius how he had defended him for years, stating quite accurately that “all the
      squabbles I ever had with the English [on the General Council] from the founding of the International up to the
      last Conference have sprung simply from my always taking your part …” He reviewed some of the cases. “You seem,
      however, to imagine that when you make blunders, people have to give you compliments, instead of telling you the
      truth like everybody else.” Marvelous to relate, this letter ended as follows:
    </div>
<div class="bqi2" id="noteh--389">
      Finally, I give you a piece of good advice. Don’t think that your old personal and party friends are and remain
      any the less fond of you if they consider it their duty to face up to your °freaks° [freakish moods].
      Contrariwise, don’t imagine that the small clique of Englishmen who are using you for certain purposes are your
      friends. I could if I wished prove the contrary.
    </div>
<div class="bqi2" id="noteh--390">
      And with this, <em class="calibre8" id="noteh--391">salut.</em> Since my birthday is day after tomorrow, I would not like to reach
      it with the unpleasant conviction that I have lost one of my oldest friends and cothinkers.—<em class="calibre8" id="noteh--392">Salut fraternel</em>!<sup class="calibre13" id="noteh--393"><a class="calibre14" id="notehfn65"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#notehfn65-r" id="noteh--395">65</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="indentt" id="noteh--396">
      Eccarius apparently did not even reply to this appeal.<sup class="calibre13" id="noteh--397"><a class="calibre14" id="notehfn66"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#notehfn66-r" id="noteh--399">66</a></sup> He did noise abroad his break with his mentor;
      we know he wrote to Wilhelm Liebknecht in Germany. Liebknecht concluded from his letter that Eccarius had gone
      out of his head, and wrote to Jenny Marx for information. Jenny replied she had asked Engels to write in her
      stead about “the dirty doings and infamies, which I can’t think about without disgust and couldn’t relate coldly
      and calmly enough.” Engels’ long letter summarized mainly the events of the last period, the gory details of
      which we have spared the reader. It is a very factual presentation, <a class="calibre6" id="page_653"></a>ending with the opinion
      that Eccarius’ trouble was that he tried to turn the International into a “milch cow for himself, riding
      roughshod over all [other] considerations.” If (he said) Liebknecht wrote to the other Continental coworkers of
      the General Council—Lochner, Lessner, Pfánder, Frankel—“you will hardly get so cool and unimpassioned an answer
      as from me.”<sup class="calibre13" id="noteh--401"><a class="calibre14" id="notehfn67"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#notehfn67-r" id="noteh--403">67</a></sup> But, then, Engels had not nursed Eccarius back to health for years, as Jenny
      had, nor had he seen Eccarius at work close up, as had Eccarius’ colleagues in the Council.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="noteh--404">
      Alas, Eccarius did not have what it took to capitalize on his break with everything that had ever made his life
      significant. By 1877 he was dismissed by the <em class="calibre8" id="noteh--405">Times</em>, having nothing more it
      wanted.<sup class="calibre13" id="noteh--406"><a class="calibre14" id="notehfn68"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#notehfn68-r" id="noteh--408">68</a></sup> He was now a squeezed lemon. He died in 1889. Posthumously, this poor devil
      who had yearned to be recognized as a leader and theoretician of international socialism suffered a cruel blow:
      when the archives of the Austrian government were opened after the fall of the Hapsburgs in 1918, it was
      announced in the Austrian socialist press that Eccarius had been a spy who provided the Austrian government with
      confidential information about the International. Collins and Abramsky, who report this, explain that the
      accusation was possibly a misunderstanding, that it may have been due to Eccarius’ writing reports for and
      getting paid by an Austrian editor who was indeed a police spy, and that the charge must be considered not
      proved, pending an examination of the Austrian police archives.<sup class="calibre13" id="noteh--409"><a class="calibre14" id="notehfn69"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#notehfn69-r" id="noteh--411">69</a></sup> This is a sound
      caution.

<div class="indent" id="noteh--413">
      Let us now remind ourselves that this is how sophisticated marxology has proved—by “documentation”—that Marx held
      a skeptical view of the proletariat. For the definition of <em class="calibre8" id="noteh--414">sophisticated</em>, the reader is
      referred exclusively to the Oxford English Dictionary.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="noteh--415">
      In point of fact, the story of Marx’s hopes for Eccarius illustrates a quite different point, one of some
      importance. Marx invested so much supportive effort in Eccarius because the tailor could, and did, become a
      first-class <em class="calibre8" id="noteh--416">worker-intellectual</em> (to use a later term). The importance to Marx of such a
      proletarian cadre has been stated elsewhere in these pages: it could eliminate or reduce the need for bourgeois
      intellectuals in the movement. Eccarius, like Wilhelm Wolff, was prized because his successes showed that
      proletarian elements could eventually do the jobs that tended to be monopolized by the “eddicated” bourgeois
      whose corruptive role Marx and Engels so often denounced. In short, the facts about the Marx-Eccarius story show
      precisely the reverse of the undocumented insinuations that are so popular with marxologists.
