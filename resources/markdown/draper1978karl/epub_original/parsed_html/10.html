<div class="indent" id="ch03--2">
      The question just discussed, the ground for Marx’s orientation toward the proletariat, has a negative
      counterpart. There were popular views about the proletariat that Marx rejected, including certain grounds for
      pro-working-class sympathies.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch03--3">
      To begin with, Marx had to reject the pervasive philanthropism of the early socialists, who, as the <em class="calibre8" id="ch03--4">Communist Manifesto</em> eventually explained, “are conscious of caring chiefly for the interests of
      the working class, as being the most suffering class. Only from the point of view of being the most suffering
      class does the proletariat exist for them.” This was not primarily a sociological observation; in the case of the
      early socialists the proletariat “offers to them the spectacle of a class without any historical initiative or
      any independent political movement.”<sup class="calibre13" id="ch03--5"><a class="calibre14" id="ch03fn1"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch03fn1-r" id="ch03--7">1</a></sup> Pity and do-goodism, excellent attributes for charitably inclined ladies and
      gentlemen, stand in antithesis to the perspective of revolution: the desire to do good for the people is
      counterposed against the need for the people to do it themselves.
    </div>
<h3 class="h2" id="ch03lev1">1. THE REJECTION OF ILLUSIONS</h3>
<div class="indent" id="ch03--9">
      Equally important was the fact that the revolutionaries’ historical analysis relieved them of the natural impulse
      to harbor comforting illusions about the individuals or strata making up the chosen class, as if the latter was
      truly a chosen people.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch03--10">
      During Marx’s youth, the propagandistic elocution about The People that emanated from the bourgeois revolutionary
      tradition of ’89 and ’93 had been transmogrified in the early socialist movement into <a class="calibre6" id="page_50"></a>philanthropic-humanitarian rhetoric about the suffering proletariat. It can be read in great
      quantity, in perhaps its most attractive guise, in English Chartist literature; it can be seen in its most
      repulsive form in Eugène Sue’s “socialistic” romances like <em class="calibre8" id="ch03--12">The Mysteries of Paris.</em>
      Idealization of “proletarians” (really artisanal workers for the most part) in the French communist clubs was
      reflected in the roseate glow of Marx’s first reaction to meeting circles of genuine workers in Paris.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch03--13"><a class="calibre14" id="ch03fn2"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch03fn2-r" id="ch03--15">2</a></sup> It was the
      development of his historical and theoretical analysis that freed him to be as tough-minded as necessary about
      the ignorance, backwardness, or venality of sections of the working class as it is, along with seeing their
      capacity for militancy, sacrifice, heroism, and other laudable qualities. This analysis, with the help of
      educational experience, also gave him another context: the capacity of the bourgeoisie and its intelligentsia to
      be outdone by no one in ignorance, backwardness, and venality, with less excuse.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch03--16">
      In fact, in another year Marx had disposed of this traditional approach. In <em class="calibre8" id="ch03--17">The Holy
      Family</em> he answered Bruno Bauer’s diatribes against the masses in this way: “When socialist writers ascribe
      this [revolutionary] world-historic role to the proletariat, it is not at all, as Critical Criticism [Bauer]
      pretends to believe, because they regard the proletariat as <em class="calibre8" id="ch03--18">gods.</em> Rather the
      contrary.”<sup class="calibre13" id="ch03--19"><a class="calibre14" id="ch03fn3"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch03fn3-r" id="ch03--21">3</a></sup> The contrary was a great deal of overemphasis on the “dehumanization” of the
      proletariat, serving to underline the factors of objective necessity. The proletariat “cannot emancipate itself
      without abolishing the conditions of its own life. It cannot abolish the conditions of its own life without
      abolishing <em class="calibre8" id="ch03--22">all</em> the inhuman conditions of life of society today which are summed up in its
      own situation.”<sup class="calibre13" id="ch03--23"><a class="calibre14" id="ch03fn4"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch03fn4-r" id="ch03--25">4</a></sup>

<div class="indent" id="ch03--26">
      The mythology that makes White Knights out of horny-handed workers or Galahads out of certified proletarians was
      later elaborated by radical literati out slumming; but it has nothing to do with Marx. His correspondence,
      particularly with Engels, can yield a thick anthology of uninhibited damnations against workers and workers’
      groups, as well as against all other known classes, groups and creeds, for behaving like asses, sheep, knaves,
      traitors, clowns, reactionaries, and renegades—all of which proves his impartial cantankerousness.<a class="calibre6" id="ch03en1-r"></a><a class="nounder1" href="43.html#ch03en1" id="ch03--28">*</a> During the American Civil War, Marx
      could offhandedly write Engels that “England has <a class="calibre6" id="page_51"></a>disgraced herself more than any other
      country, the workers by their christian slave nature, the bourgeois and aristocrats by their enthusiasm for
      slavery,”<sup class="calibre13" id="ch03--30"><a class="calibre14" id="ch03fn5"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch03fn5-r" id="ch03--32">5</a></sup> and later rebound to enthusiasm for English workers’ support to the North. In a
      letter to Marx, Engels commented on the education of the Chartist leftist Ernest Jones:
    </div>
<div class="bq" id="ch03--33">
      … without our doctrine he … would never have found out how on the one hand the instinctive class hatred of the
      workers against the industrial bourgeoisie, the sole possible basis for the reorganization of the Chartist party,
      can not only be retained but even widened, developed and made to serve as the foundation of enlightening
      propaganda, and how on the other hand one can be progressive all the same and oppose the reactionary cravings of
      the workers and their prejudices.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch03--34"><a class="calibre14" id="ch03fn6"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch03fn6-r" id="ch03--36">6</a></sup>

<div class="indent" id="ch03--37">
      To call the proletariat a revolutionary class is a condensation: it means a class with the historical potential
      of making a revolution; it is a label for a social drive; it is not a description of current events. This
      revolutionary class begins, like everybody else, by being filled with “reactionary cravings” and prejudices:
      otherwise the proletarian revolution would always be around the corner. Marx’s theory looks on the proletariat as
      an objective agency of social revolution in the process of becoming. In this respect his conception of the
      proletariat as the historically revolutionary class is similar to his reiterated view that the bourgeoisie was
      such a revolutionary class in a previous era, in spite of its well-known timidity and narrow-mindedness.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch03--38">
      One of the illusions, therefore, that Marx combats is the illusion of the Instant Revolution. Put crudely it
      goes: <em class="calibre8" id="ch03--39">If the proletariat is by nature revolutionary, then why doesn’t it go and make a
      revolution?</em> This unhistorical ultimatism crops up frequently in socialist history, but not as an outcome of
      Marx’s theory; it typically reflects the impatience of bourgeois intellectuals who cannot afford to wait.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch03--40">
      Such was the case with the ultraleftists in the Communist League after the failure of the revolution to sweep
      Europe in 1849. One of them wrote Marx in 1851: “Your warning that one should not harbor any illusions about the
      proletariat was really very well taken by me.” Thereupon this fire-eater, who had been impatient for a good
      insurrection the year before, repudiated socialism in another year and wound up life as a minister of the,
      kaiser.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch03--41"><a class="calibre14" id="ch03fn7"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch03fn7-r" id="ch03--43">7</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="indent" id="ch03--44">
      The proletariat is a part of bourgeois society; it is born and raised in the same slough. The problem of
      revolution begins there, it does not <a class="calibre6" id="page_52"></a>end. As Laura Marx once put it, in a letter to Engels:
      “The rottenness of our society breaks out, there is no denying it, as well among the workmen as the Wilsons
      [referring to a French deputy symbolizing corruption] and a revolution is badly needed to sweep the world
      clean.”<sup class="calibre13" id="ch03--46"><a class="calibre14" id="ch03fn8"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch03fn8-r" id="ch03--48">8</a></sup> Over a long life Engels observed the corruption of workers, including
      revolutionary workers, by bourgeois society under various pressures. Commenting on the rife corruption of the
      Social-Democracy’s bourgeois intellectual parliamentarians in the 1880s, he thought back to a comparison with an
      old practical problem:
    </div>
<div class="bq" id="ch03--49">
      The necessarily more or less bourgeois parliamentarians [of the Social-Democratic party] are an inevitable evil
      just like the case of workers who are blacklisted by the bourgeoisie, hence left jobless, and who are saddled on
      the party as professional propagandists. The latter case was already rife in 1839-1848 among the Chartists and I
      was able to observe it at that time. Give them a per-diem allowance and they will go over to the dominant
      bourgeois and petty-bourgeois or “educated” deputies. But all that will be overcome. My confidence in our
      proletariat is just as unqualified as my mistrust of the wholly rotten German philistinedom is unbounded.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch03--50"><a class="calibre14" id="ch03fn9"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch03fn9-r" id="ch03--52">9</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="noindent" id="ch03--53">
      How will it be overcome?
    </div>
<h3 class="h2" id="ch03lev2">2. THE PROLETARIAT AS PROCESS: MATURATION</h3>
<div class="indent" id="ch03--55">
      So far we have often referred to the proletariat as if it constituted a homogeneous whole. All such global
      statements are approximations at best. Most of the problems of proletarian revolution stem from the massive role
      of divisions, disproportions, and disparities within the working classes, among its different sectors, and among
      its individuals. The process of overcoming these diversities and discords is a key part of the road to
      proletarian revolution.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch03--56">
      One can view this process as one of maturation. Maturation has several sides (physical, intellectual, emotional,
      and so on) even in the simple case of an individual; so also in the case of a class, which is a more complex
      phenomenon. To mention a few prominent aspects:
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch03--57">
      1. There is the process of maturation of the objective conditions <a class="calibre6" id="page_53"></a>under which the proletariat
      develops, that is, the maturation of the economic system itself.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch03--59">
      2. This is closely connected with a process of homogenization in the conditions of existence of different sectors
      of the working class (though this process is never complete). There are innumerable subdivisions of this problem,
      from the effect of labor aristocracies to the radicalizing (or alienating) effect of different occupations; we
      will have occasion to mention some in the course of illustrations.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch03--60">
      3. In explaining Marx’s theory of the state and social evolution, there is inevitable emphasis on the “ruling
      ideas of the ruling class,” the decisive effect of bourgeois domination on social outlooks. The working class, of
      course, is as subject to this effect as the rest of society; in fact, it is the chief target. The process of
      maturation is, in these terms, the process in which the working class frees itself from the impact of bourgeois
      power, propaganda, and socioeconomic pressures. But all other differences aside, that part of the working class
      which is always under the strongest pressure from the bourgeois world is its leadership. As the interface between
      the proletariat and its dominators, workingclass leaders take the brunt of this pressure, and (like earth strata
      suffering from slippage) it is this layer that is most easily deformed by the resulting stresses and strains. The
      process of maturation demands an eye on the relation between the class and its leadership or representatives.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch03--61">
      4. Finally, maturation is closely associated with the self-organization of the class; in fact, the latter can be
      viewed as the measuring rod of the former. Insofar as organization is the barometer of maturation, some of the
      problems of maturation will come up concretely below in <a class="nounder1" href="11.html#ch04" id="ch03--62">Chapters 4</a> and <a class="nounder1" href="12.html#ch05" id="ch03--63">5</a> on trade-unionism.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch03--64">
      We begin here with the first and basic aspect of the question. The maturation of the proletariat goes hand in
      hand, if not step by step, with the level of development of the capitalist economy itself. There cannot be a
      strong proletariat without widespread or intensive industrialization. Contrariwise, weak development of industry
      and commerce implies an underdeveloped proletariat. In addition, disparities will arise in the stage of social
      development of the working class within a country and between countries.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch03--65">
      When the 1848 revolution broke out, Engels noted, both the bourgeoisie and the proletariat of Germany were more
      backward than the <a class="calibre6" id="page_54"></a>French and English. (“Like master, like man.”) The different stages of
      development induce different reactions to the revolutionary wave.
    </div>
<div class="bq" id="ch03--67">
      °°The working-class movement itself never is independent, never is of an exclusively proletarian character until
      all the different factions of the middle class [that is, the bourgeoisie] and particularly its most progressive
      faction, the large manufacturers, have conquered political power …<sup class="calibre13" id="ch03--68"><a class="calibre14" id="ch03fn10"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch03fn10-r" id="ch03--70">10</a></sup>

      The big bourgeoisie, the “large manufacturers,” are more progressive in the basic economic sense that, by
      developing industry on a large scale, they also develop the social conditions for the growth, organization, and
      education of a modern proletariat: that is, they produce their own gravediggers.
    </div>
<div class="bq" id="ch03--72">
      Now, in Germany the mass of the working class were employed, not by those modern manufacturing lords of which
      Great Britain furnishes such splendid specimens, but by small tradesmen, whose entire manufacturing system is a
      mere relic of the Middle Ages. And as there is an enormous difference between the great cotton lord and the petty
      cobbler or master tailor, so there is a corresponding distance from the wide-awake factory operative of modern
      manufacturing Babylons to the bashful journeyman tailor or cabinet-maker of a small country town, who lives in
      circumstances and works after a plan very little different from those of the like sort of men some five hundred
      years ago.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch03--73"><a class="calibre14" id="ch03fn11"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch03fn11-r" id="ch03--75">11</a></sup>

<div class="noindent" id="ch03--76">
      The lack of modern economic conditions (continues Engels) means “a pretty equally general absence of modern
      ideas.” In the Germany of 1848 a large part of the working class actually raised the cry for a return to the
      medieval guild system. Only a “mere minority” were even capable as yet of thinking in terms of their emancipation
      as a class. But after all, it was only four years before, with the uprisings of the Silesian and Bohemian textile
      workers, that a working-class movement had come into existence in Germany at all!<sup class="calibre13" id="ch03--77"><a class="calibre14" id="ch03fn12"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch03fn12-r" id="ch03--79">12</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="indent" id="ch03--80">
      Some thirty years later, by the 1880s, the picture in Germany was vastly different, and still changing. In
      letters Engels used to give the German party’s editor, E. Bernstein, a sort of correspondence course in this
      question. In the immediate background was the problem of disparities within the working-class movement, in the
      first place of opportunistic currents in the party, and of the relationship between radicalization and
      impoverishment in the mass. In one such letter Engels began by <a class="calibre6" id="page_55"></a>expressing his joy that “The
      center of gravity of the movement has shifted from the semirural districts of Saxony into the <em class="calibre8" id="ch03--82">big industrial cities”:</em>
</div>
<div class="bqi" id="ch03--83">
      The mass of our people in Saxony consists of hand-weavers, who are doomed to extinction by the steam loom, and
      only drag out an existence on starvation wages through side jobs (gardening, toy carving, etc.). These people are
      in an economically reactionary situation and represent a declining stage of production. Therefore they are, to
      say the least, not the natural-born representatives of revolutionary socialism to the same extent as the workers
      in large-scale industry. They are not on that account reactionary by nature (as, for instance, the remnants of
      the hand-weavers here [in England] finally became—the hard core of the “Conservative Working Men”), but they are
      unreliable in the long run. Especially also because of their terribly miserable condition, which makes them far
      less capable of resistance than the urban workers, and because of their dispersion, which makes it easier to
      enslave them than the people of the big towns. In view of the facts given in the <em class="calibre8" id="ch03--84">Sozialdemokrat</em>, the heroism with which these poor devils have still held out in such numbers is
      indeed to be admired.
    </div>
<div class="noindent" id="ch03--85">
      But misery and militancy do not add up to the historic mission of the proletariat:
    </div>
<div class="bqi1" id="ch03--86">
      But they are not the right kind of nucleus for a great national movement. Under certain circumstances—as from
      1865 to 1870—their misery makes them more immediately responsive to socialist views than the big-city people. But
      the same misery also makes them unreliable. A drowning man grasps at every straw, and cannot wait for the
      rescuing boat to cast off from shore. The boat is the socialist revolution; the straw is the protective tariff
      and [Bismarckian] state-socialism. It is indicative that in our old districts it is almost only the Conservatives
      that have any chance against us. And if Kayser [opportunist Social-Democratic deputy] could perpetuate such an
      absurdity as the protective tariff business, without the others daring to come right out against it, the trouble
      lies (as Bebel himself wrote me) nowhere else than among the voters, especially Kayser’s!
    </div>
<div class="bqi2" id="ch03--87">
      Now everything is different. Berlin, Hamburg, Breslau, Leipzig, Dresden, Mainz, Offenbach, Barmen, Elberfeld,
      Solingen, Nuremberg, Frankfurt, Hanau, <em class="calibre8" id="ch03--88">plus</em> Chemnitz and the Erzgebirge <a class="calibre6" id="page_56"></a>districts—that provides an entirely different foothold. The class which is revolutionary because of
      its economic position has become the nucleus of the movement.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch03--90"><a class="calibre14" id="ch03fn13"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch03fn13-r" id="ch03--92">13</a></sup>

      The last sentence emphasizes that objective social situation is the basic factor conditioning the revolutionary
      maturation of the proletariat, though other elements may bring about conjunctural radicalization (misery, for
      example). The unstable radicalism of the old declining crafts was also one of the chief weaknesses of the First
      International in Britain, since the International’s base lay more among these crafts than in heavy

      Engels was often more interested in the political consequences of these patterns than in the theory of

      We cannot draw the mass of the nation over to us without this mass gradually developing itself. Frankfurt,
      Munich, Königsberg cannot suddenly become as pronouncedly proletarian as Saxony, Berlin, the mining-industry
      districts. The petty-bourgeois elements among the leaders will temporarily find in the masses, here and there,
      the background they lacked hitherto. What has hitherto been a reactionary current among individuals can now
      reproduce itself as a necessary element of development—locally—among the masses. This would make change in
      tactics necessary, in order to lead the masses farther along without thereupon leaving the bad leaders on

      All this emphasizes the objective side of the development. But the social-historic process is naturally
      accompanied by changes in consciousness (social psychology). Another way of looking at both aspects is suggested

<div class="indent" id="ch03--104">
      The term <em class="calibre8" id="ch03--105">bourgeoisification</em> may suggest the image of a virginally uncorrupted proletariat
      being debauched by a pathological process. The historical reality is not that simple-minded.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch03--106">
      The proletariat comes into the world in an already bourgeoisified <a class="calibre6" id="page_57"></a>milieu; and outside this
      milieu the main alternatives are simply more reactionary prebourgeois conditions and ideas. But the proletariat
      does not arrive panoplied in full modernity any more than does the bourgeoisie; it evolves over a historical era
      from more backward conditions, trailing the old consciousness as well. As society itself is bourgeoisified, so
      too is the proletariat—that is, developed into the modern working class typical of bourgeois society. At this
      stage, bourgeoisification also means progress and maturation.

<div class="indent" id="ch03--108">
      For a whole transitional era, complained Marx and Engels, German society—all classes, hence also the
      proletariat—remained under the sign of the pigtail, symbol of prebourgeois backwardness. As Engels explained:
      °°“A country cannot pass through 200 years like what 16481848 were for Germany without leaving a small impression
      of the philistine even on the working class. Our revolution of 48/49 was too short and too incomplete to wipe

      From the outset we have fought to the utmost against the petty-bourgeois philistine mentality within the party,

      It happens that Engels’ target here is the reformist leadership of the Social-Democratic Party itself, but he is
      not describing them as merely bearers of bourgeoisification; for the bourgeois intelligentsia, like the
      bourgeoisie, was also infected with “the hereditary German plague.” Under German conditions, the debilitating
      consciousness they promoted <a class="calibre6" id="page_58"></a>derived also from earlier influences, as did the flabbiness of
      the German bourgeoisie itself in face of the Bismarckian state.

      A distinction must be made therefore: a <em class="calibre8" id="ch03--121">modernized</em> proletariat develops along with the

      another matter; for this modern proletariat arrives in struggle with the bourgeoisie.

<div class="indentb" id="ch03--122">
      In another letter directed against the reformist leadership, Engels likewise counterposed the influence of
      modernizing forces on the proletariat against the narrow backwardness of social relations in the country:
    </div>
<div class="alpha-list" id="ch03--123">
      I never concealed the fact that in my opinion the masses in Germany are much better than the gentlemen [who are
      their] leaders … Germany is an atrocious country for people who have little will-power. The narrowness and
      pettiness of civil as well as political conditions, the small-town character of even the big cities, the small
      but constantly increasing pettifoggeries in the struggle with police and bureaucracy—all this enervates instead
      of spurring on to resistance; and so in this “big children’s nursery” [as Heine put it] many become childish
      themselves. Petty conditions beget petty outlooks, so that it takes great understanding and energy for anyone
      living in Germany to see beyond the immediate, to keep one’s eye on the large-scale interconnection of world
      events, and not to fall into that self-complacent “objectivity” which sees no further than its nose and precisely
      for that reason is the most narrowminded subjectivity even when it is shared by thousands of such subjects.

<div class="bqi2" id="ch03--124">
      … [This trend] must be fought resolutely. And here the mass of workers themselves furnish the best point of

      social and political, are petty and trivial and revolve around trivialities which elsewhere have long been
      settled, their struggle is the only one with grandeur, the only one that is up to the mark of the times, the only

      The same pattern could be seen in France, though it was more modernized than Germany. There the mass legacy from
      the prebourgeois past was the peasantry, and sectors of the proletariat were <a class="calibre6" id="page_59"></a>continuously
      being recruited from this source. A worker did not become a modern proletarian the day after he left the farm in
      the Franche-Comté and got a job in a Paris workshop. This could be seen on a big scale especially when
      Bonaparte’s prefect for Paris, Haussmann, carried through an urban renewal project in Paris involving much
      building and boulevard construction, work that gave new employment to building-trades workers, thus buying them
      off as supporters of the Second Empire. This was the source of “the imperialistic [Bonapartist], Haussmannist
      building-trade proletariat stemming from the peasants, which Bonaparte created in the big towns,” wrote
      Engels.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch03--131"><a class="calibre14" id="ch03fn19"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch03fn19-r" id="ch03--133">19</a></sup> These new-minted proletarians were yesterday’s peasants, therefore peasants

      England, the most modern society in Europe, was also notoriously encrusted with traditionalism in thought as well

      There is still another complication, a countervailing factor arising from prebourgeois conditions. While big

      undisputed industrial domination of the world. In Germany, too, the development of large-scale industry since

      Even in the 1890s, when this sad state of affairs was changing rapidly, Engels was as ready to express his
      impatience at the English workers “with their sense of fancied national superiority, with their essentially
      bourgeois ideas and views, with the narrowmindedness of their ‘practical’ outlook, with their leaders who are
      strongly infected with parliamentary corruption,” though he immediately added: “But things are moving forward for

      Especially with regard to England, there was a long-term factor that overshadowed the short-term pattern of boom
      and bust. This, as Engels emphasized many times over several decades, was England’s economic monopoly position on
      the world market, the profits of which trickled down to its working class and muted its struggle. As early as
      1856 Engels had noted this effect in the specific case of Ireland: “Ireland may be regarded as the first English
      colony … and one can already notice here that the so-called liberty of English citizens is based on the
      oppression of the colonies.”<sup class="calibre13" id="ch03--201"><a class="calibre14" id="ch03fn31"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch03fn31-r" id="ch03--203">31</a></sup> As he and Marx were to reiterate later, the loss of Ireland could be decisive

      Colonies were a special form of superexploitation, but economically England’s industrial superiority levied an

<div class="bq" id="ch03--205">
      … the English proletariat is actually becoming more and more bourgeois, so that this most bourgeois of all

      the antics of the English socialist sects, he explained that “apart from the unexpected, a really general
      workers’ movement will come into existence here [in England] only when the workers feel that England’s world

      “Sharing the feast” is a key idea. Insofar as the proletariat does get a sufficient share of the feast, the class

      mentioned that the proletariat’s interface with the bourgeoisie, its leadership, is inevitably under the greatest
      social pressure. On a somewhat less ideological level, it must also be stressed that it is much easier for the
      bourgeoisie to “share the feast” with a restricted sector of the working class than with the whole. This
      understandable strategy applies to several such sectors (especially the labor aristocracy, as we shall see) but
      it applies most forcibly to that thin section of the proletariat which is both indispensable and specially

      It would be a mistake to see this solely in cash terms, a worse mistake to see the problem as simple bribery.
      Such cases, while frequent enough, are least interesting. Even where money is directly involved, its power can be
      exerted publicly or semipublicly. When Engels wrote that “The leaders [of the English movement] are almost all
      petty <a class="calibre6" id="page_64"></a>unreliable fellows … while the two big bourgeois parties stand there, purse in hand, on

      But the more profound respect in which a labor leadership is bought off is not by money at all, but by social
      cooptation (which naturally may be accompanied by perquisites). Marx called the turn on two trade-union leaders
      who were still active in the General Council of the International when he observed (to Engels) that they “are
      both possessed with a mania for compromise and a thirst for respectability.”<sup class="calibre13" id="ch03--244"><a class="calibre14" id="ch03fn40"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch03fn40-r" id="ch03--246">40</a></sup> When both openly embraced
      bourgeois respectability, after the to-do of the respectables over the Paris Commune, it was not because they
      were being paid in money. The trade-union candidates coopted by the Liberals, wrote Engels, are “so-called
      workers’ representatives, that is, those people who are forgiven their being members of the working class because
      they themselves would like to drown their quality of being workers in the ocean of their liberalism …”<sup class="calibre13" id="ch03--247"><a class="calibre14" id="ch03fn41"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch03fn41-r" id="ch03--249">41</a></sup>

      The most repulsive thing here [in England] is the bourgeois “respectability” which has grown deep into the bones

      own pride but also its inborn respect for its “betters” and “superiors,” is so old and firmly established that
      the bourgeois still find it fairly easy to get their bait accepted. I am not at all sure, for instance, that John
      Burns is not secretly prouder of his popularity with Cardinal Manning, the Lord Mayor, and the bourgeoisie in
      general than of his popularity with his own class…. And even Tom Mann, whom I regard as the best of the lot, is
      fond of mentioning that he will be lunching with the Lord Mayor. If one compares this with the French, one

      This sort of thing does not happen because a John Burns is more corruptible than any other John, for it is only

      In the last analysis, it is misleading to consider something called bourgeoisification as an independent
      phenomenon. It is a useful term especially for the more extreme manifestations of a bourgeois mentality and of
      cooptation to a bourgeois lifestyle, but at bottom the characteristics and pressures it denotes are mainly the
      negative side of the proletariat’s maturation toward class-consciousness. In a bourgeois society, everything is

<div class="indent" id="ch03--272">
      The splitting up of the working class into antagonistic fractions, and the overcoming of this split, are crucial
      to the process leading to proletarian revolution. A survey of differences inside the working class would show a
      very long list of important points of short-term and long-term conflict inside the class—about as much as beset
      the capitalist class.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch03--273"><a class="calibre14" id="ch03fn47"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch03fn47-r" id="ch03--275">47</a></sup> All of them are rooted in, and some concern only, intra-class competition for
      livelihood. Marx stated this pattern very early, as the basis for a long-range view of proletarian development:
    </div>
<div class="bqi" id="ch03--276">
      Competition separates individuals from one another, not only the bourgeois but still more the workers, in spite
      of the fact that it brings them together. Hence it is a long time before these individuals can unite, apart from
      the fact that for the purpose of this union—if it is not to be merely local—the necessary means, the big
      industrial cities and cheap and quick communications, have first to be produced by large-scale industry. Hence
      every organized power standing over against these isolated individuals, who live in conditions daily reproducing
      this isolation, can only be overcome after long struggles. To demand the opposite would be tantamount to
      demanding that competition should not exist in this definite epoch of history, or that the individuals should
      banish from their minds conditions over which in their isolation they have no control.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch03--277"><a class="calibre14" id="ch03fn48"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch03fn48-r" id="ch03--279">48</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="indent" id="ch03--280">
      Many of these areas of competition are more important as trade-union problems than for present purposes; but the
      type of internal conflict which we take for illustration here is also one that traditionally has racking
      political effects. This is the antagonisms among different groups (taken by ethnic or national origin, color,
      creed, or other division) within the proletariat of a single country. This question has a long dark history; we
      will give a couple of brief illustrations.

      1. <em class="calibre8" id="ch03--282">Irish workers in England.</em> Marx saw this problem as intimately linked to the need for
      Ireland’s liberation from English rule, which, by draining Ireland economically, forced its surplus labor into
      the English market, and “thus forces down wages and lowers the moral and material condition of the English
      working class”:

      As a consequence of this analysis, one of the main fields of activity of the International in England, under
      Marx’s leadership, was the struggle of the Irish workers, who were well represented in the General Council. There
      were successes; reporting an important demonstration, held in spite of a police ban, Engels related:

<div class="bqi" id="ch03--304">
      This is the first time an Irish demonstration has been held in Hyde Park; it was very successful … It is also the

      classes, are now offering one another the hand of friendship; this gratifying fact is due principally to the
      influence of the last General Council of the International, which has always directed all its efforts to unite

      2. <em class="calibre8" id="ch03--310">Black workers in the United States.</em> Irish workers were the <a class="calibre6" id="page_68"></a>“niggers” of England, as we have seen Marx mention above, but it was the American case that
      provided the biggest arena for this pattern of exploitation. It is in the U.S. melting pot that the widest
      variety of racial and national conflicts have been kept boiling; the effect was to split the proletariat and
      corrupt the socialist movement, which was also shot through with anti-Chinese racism as the importation of
      Chinese cheap labor undercut working conditions.

<div class="indent" id="ch03--312">
      Our concern here is not with justice for the oppressed, but something else. Just as the liberation of Ireland was
      a necessity for <em class="calibre8" id="ch03--313">English</em> freedom from capitalist rule, so also Marx saw the special
      oppression of black labor in the United States as a life-and-death problem of the class struggle of the entire

<div class="bqi" id="ch03--314">
      In the United States of North America, every independent movement of the workers was paralyzed so long as slavery
      disfigured a part of the Republic. Labor with a white skin cannot emancipate itself where labor with a black skin
      is branded. But out of the death of slavery a new life at once arose. The first fruit of the Civil War was the
      eight hours’ agitation …<sup class="calibre13" id="ch03--315"><a class="calibre14" id="ch03fn52"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch03fn52-r" id="ch03--317">52</a></sup>

<div class="noindent" id="ch03--318">
      During the Civil War one of the bases for Marx’s support to Northern victory was the thesis that the enslavement
      of blacks also meant the superexploitation of white workers. If slavery spread to new states, argued Marx in
      1861, then—
    </div>
<div class="bq" id="ch03--319">
      The slave system would infect the whole Union. In the Northern states, where Negro slavery is in practice
      unworkable, the white working class would gradually be forced down to the level of helotry. This would accord
      with the loudly proclaimed principle that only certain races are capable of freedom, and as the actual labor is
      the lot of the Negro in the South, so in the North it is the lot of the German and the Irishman, or their direct
      descendants.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch03--320"><a class="calibre14" id="ch03fn53"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch03fn53-r" id="ch03--322">53</a></sup>

<div class="indentb" id="ch03--323">
      In the United States, the English-Irish antagonism became intertwined with native-immigrant and black-white
      antagonisms in one cluster of internecine hatreds that was the bulwark of the Democratic Party, to which Marx
      referred as “this conservative and °blackleg° element.”<sup class="calibre13" id="ch03--324"><a class="calibre14" id="ch03fn54"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch03fn54-r" id="ch03--326">54</a></sup> In the first place, Marx linked transatlantic
      tension between England and America with the latter’s growing Irish population: “The English and American
      governments (or the classes they represent) play on these feelings in order to perpetuate the covert struggle
      between <a class="calibre6" id="page_69"></a>the United States and England.” This tension also provides England with a pretext for
      maintaining “a <em class="calibre8" id="ch03--328">big standing army</em>, which, if need be, as has happened before, can be used
      against the English workers after having done its military training in Ireland.”<sup class="calibre13" id="ch03--329"><a class="calibre14" id="ch03fn55"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch03fn55-r" id="ch03--331">55</a></sup> In the United States, the
      Irish made their way up over the backs of the blacks. When, in the 1862 elections after the Republicans had
      finally come out for the abolition of slavery, the Democrats made gains in New York and elsewhere, Marx pointed
      to some elements in the ethnic pattern:
    </div>
<div class="alpha-list" id="ch03--332">
      The <em class="calibre8" id="ch03--333">city</em> of New York, mightily torn apart by the Irish mob, actively involved in the
      slave trade up to recent times, the seat of the American money market, and full of owners of mortgages on
      Southern plantations, was from time immemorial decisively “Democratic,” just as Liverpool is still pro-Tory
      today….
    </div>
<div class="bqi2" id="ch03--334">
      … The Irishman sees in the Negro a dangerous competitor. The sturdy farmers of Indiana and Ohio hate the Negro in
      second place after the slaveholder. To them he is a symbol of slavery and the debasement of the working class,
      and the Democratic press daily threatens them with an inundation of their territories by the “nigger.”<sup class="calibre13" id="ch03--335"><a class="calibre14" id="ch03fn56"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch03fn56-r" id="ch03--337">56</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="indenttb" id="ch03--338">
      The Democratic Party, the bulwark of black oppression in this period, flourished especially on the basis of
      pullulating ethnic antagonisms splitting the working class. The German and Irish workers whom Marx had referred
      to in 1861 were succeeded by immigrant waves of Italians, East Europeans, Chinese, and others, and the melting
      pot became a steaming cauldron of ethnic hostilities as each stratum was educated to trample on the lower in
      accordance with the American Way of Life. Engels offered a summary view in 1892:
    </div>
<div class="bqi2" id="ch03--339">
      Your great obstacle in America, it seems to me, lies in the exceptional position of the native workers. Up to
      1848 one could only speak of the permanent working class as an exception: the small beginnings of it in the
      cities in the East always had still the hope of becoming farmers or bourgeois. Now a working class has developed
      and has also to a great extent organized itself on trade-union lines. But it still takes up an aristocratic
      attitude and wherever possible leaves the ordinary badly paid occupations to the immigrants, of whom only a small
      section enter the aristocratic trades. But these immigrants are divided into different nationalities and
      understand neither one another nor, for the most part, the language of the country. And your [U.S.] bourgeoisie
      <a class="calibre6" id="page_70"></a>knows much better even than the Austrian government how to play off one nationality against
      the other: Jews, Italians, Bohemians, etc., against Germans and Irish, and each one against the other, so that
      differences in the standard of life of different workers exist, I believe, in New York to an extent unheard-of
      elsewhere. And added to this is the total indifference of a society which has grown up on a purely capitalist
      basis, without any comfortable feudal background, towards the human beings who succumb in the competitive
      struggle: “there will be plenty more, and more than we want, of these damned Dutchmen, Irishmen, Italians, Jews
      and Hungarians”; and, to cap it all, John Chinaman stands in the background who far surpasses them all in his
      ability to live on next to nothing.

      understands only itself: Czechs, Poles, Italians, Scandinavians, etc. And then the Negroes. To form a single
      party out of these requires quite unusually powerful incentives. Often there is a sudden violent élan, but the

      We saw that in the course of the young Marx’s development, the adoption of an orientation toward the proletariat
      as the revolutionary class first had to solve the problem posed by Hegel’s position, which <a class="calibre6" id="page_71"></a>counterposed classes with particular (selfish) interests against a universal class which stood for
      the general interests of society against all particularism. Marx not only rejected the notion that the state
      bureaucracy was such a universal class, but also the idea that any class embodied society’s universal interest in
      some eternal way. The universal class, in a given historical context, was one whose own interests were such as to
      coincide with the transformation needed by society as a whole. In this sense, he nominated the proletariat as the
      universal class of the coming era, hence the class agent of revolution.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch03--354"><a class="calibre14" id="ch03fn59"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch03fn59-r" id="ch03--356">59</a></sup>

      integration is possible only for the revolutionary class of the era. It is necessary in order to broaden the
      social base of proletarian revolution.

<h3 class="h2" id="ch03lev7">7. REVOLUTIONIZING THE REVOLUTIONARY CLASS</h3>
<div class="indent" id="ch03--402">
      There is a final problem Marx had to solve, the solution to which is the capstone of his theory of revolution.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch03--403">
      The young Marx began, like all other socialists of the time, with the proletarian seen as victim. Emphasizing,
      and at first exaggerating, the proletariat’s total estrangement from the rest of society, he rang changes on its
      “dehumanization” as part of a Hegelian pattern whereby only complete dehumanization can negate itself into
      complete realization <a class="calibre6" id="page_73"></a>of humanity, and so forth.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch03--405"><a class="calibre14" id="ch03fn69"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch03fn69-r" id="ch03--407">69</a></sup> This was suitable for
      philosophic theses, but the Hegelian dialectic had no solution for the political difficulty this talk creates. It
      makes a workable argument for intellectuals denouncing the system for brutifying the people, but—can one expect
      these poor brutes to make a revolution, let alone build a new society?
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch03--408">
      Even if the exaggerated language is dropped, it is still true, not only of the proletariat but of the upper
      classes and scornful intellectuals, that all strata of the population under a stultifying system are mentally
      crippled by the ruling ideas they absorb, are cramped by tradition and habit into patterns of acquiescence.
      <em class="calibre8" id="ch03--409">You expect these wretches to make a revolution?</em>
</div>
<div class="indent" id="ch03--410">
      Marx’s answer is: no. These people as they are cannot make a revolution or build a new world. They will have to
      be changed and transformed before they are fit to take power or wield it. But they will not be changed by
      preachments, books, leaders, or commands. They will become fit to rule only through their own struggle—a course
      of struggles against intolerable conditions, to change the conditions and thus change themselves.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch03--411">
      On the one hand, then, it is important for Marx to point to the goal of proletarian revolution now, not waiting
      until a new and fit generation has arisen, since no such happy result will ever eventuate if the struggle is not
      begun <em class="calibre8" id="ch03--412">before</em> it has a possibility of being consummated. On the other hand, the same
      principle shows how a revolutionary can maintain an objective and cold-eyed view of the defects and inadequacies
      of the class, without illusions, since only such an attitude comprises the need for change. The principle is so
      basic that even before he was a socialist, Marx knew that if a child is told not to walk until it is able to
      walk, it will never be able to walk.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch03--413"><a class="calibre14" id="ch03fn70"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch03fn70-r" id="ch03--415">70</a></sup>

      As in so many other questions, the first suggestions of this view appear dimly in <em class="calibre8" id="ch03--417">The Holy

      The point is made yet again, this time against a challenge by Max Stirner: “a society cannot be made new,” said
      Stirner, “so long as those of whom it consists <em class="calibre8" id="ch03--443">and</em> who constitute it remain as of old.”
      This is the old static dilemma. Marx replies that the communist proletarians do not remain as of old.
    </div>
<div class="bqi" id="ch03--444">
      The tireless propaganda work carried on by these proletarians, <a class="calibre6" id="page_75"></a>their daily discussions among
      themselves [in the communist clubs], sufficiently prove how little they themselves want to remain “as of old” and
      how little they in general want people to remain “as of old.” … they know too well that only under changed
      circumstances will they cease to be “as of old,” and therefore they are determined to change these circumstances
      at the first opportunity. In revolutionary activity the changing of oneself coincides with the changing of
      circumstances.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch03--446"><a class="calibre14" id="ch03fn76"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch03fn76-r" id="ch03--448">76</a></sup>

      In Berlin the people who made the March 18 revolution were soon quieted by the king’s promises. This, wrote

      This, it turned out, was the epitaph of the revolution in Germany. Summing up the events in France, in 1850, Marx
      buried illusions with the statement that the workers were still incapable of accomplishing their tasks;

      world market:

      Praising an economic study by a working tailor, Marx made the point: “Before the proletariat wins its victory on

      Engels, in replying to this speech [writes Schoyen], made plain his and Marx’s view that revolution would come

      Two decades later, Engels had a similar point to make about the still-backward Spanish working class, leading,

      to a Constituent: “what position was the International to take?”

      Spain is so backward a country industrially that <em class="calibre8" id="ch03--481">immediate</em> complete emancipation of the

      preliminary stages of development and clear away quite a number of obstacles. The republic offered an opportunity
      to compress the course of these preliminary stages into the shortest possible period of time, and to rapidly
      eliminate these obstacles. But this opportunity could be made use of only through the active <em class="calibre8" id="ch03--482">political</em> intervention of the Spanish working class. The mass of workers felt this; everywhere
      they pressed for participation in the event, insisting that the opportunity be utilized to take action, instead
      of leaving the field free to the action and intrigues of the possessing classes, as heretofore.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch03--483"><a class="calibre14" id="ch03fn83"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch03fn83-r" id="ch03--485">83</a></sup>

      The maturation of the proletariat was not a detached process, like the training of plants in a greenhouse before

      The “great dictum”—that revolutionary struggle changes the revolutionary—was Marx’s solution to the old static
      dilemma. In 1848-1849 the revolution had proved that the working class was not yet ready to cope; but it had also
      shown the difference between revolutionary and prerevolutionary days. Struggle was the school in which the
      education took place; revolution speeded up the curriculum and enriched the course.

      But only socialists with such a theory of revolution could look on it that way. Most of the Forty-eighters faded
      away as the ground cooled, with more or less bluster. More rather than less bluster characterized the group in
      the Communist League which broke with Marx at this time on the ground that one either made a revolution right
      away or went to sleep. Either way there was no question of a long-term perspective in which a class was fitted to
      cope.

<div class="indent" id="ch03--504">
      Well before this split, Marx had stated more than once that the time <a class="calibre6" id="page_78"></a>dimension of the
      revolutionary development had to be a lengthy one. Even in his “Address to the Communist League of March 1850,”
      written while he still thought that the international revolutionary situation was continuing, he had warned that
      “the German workers are not able to attain power and achieve their class interests without completely going
      through a lengthy revolutionary development,” in the course of which they had the task of “clarifying their minds
      as to what their class interests are.”<sup class="calibre13" id="ch03--506"><a class="calibre14" id="ch03fn87"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch03fn87-r" id="ch03--508">87</a></sup> We have also seen what he had written in his series of articles <em class="calibre8" id="ch03--509">The Class Struggles in France.</em> But a minority group in the Central Committee of the league led
      by Schapper and Willich (supported by a majority of the London membership) had absorbed little of Marx’s
      conception of revolution. For them, power boiled down to an act of will. There was nothing unexpected about this,
      since this was the traditional mind-set of the old Jacobin-style revolutionism (sometimes called Blanquism after
      its best-known representative). It was the pre-Marx revolutionism of the European movement. These revolutionaries
      had no need for a lengthy period of self-change in the movement since they did not really expect the class as
      such to move at all: the rule of the revolutionary band would be imposed by a <em class="calibre8" id="ch03--510">coup de
      main</em>, and a period of educational dictatorship would follow.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch03--511">
      This trend was brought out virulently by the stresses of émigré disappointments after a failed revolution; the
      concluding debate took place at a meeting of the league’s Central Committee on September 15, 1850. In a speech
      Marx formulated the issue around the “great dictum”:
    </div>
<div class="bq" id="ch03--512">
      In place of the critical outlook the Minority substitutes a dogmatic one; in place of the materialist, an
      idealist one. Instead of the actual conditions, <em class="calibre8" id="ch03--513">pure will</em> becomes the drive-wheel of the
      revolution for them. Whereas we tell the workers: “You have fifteen, twenty, fifty years of civil wars and
      peoples’ struggles to go through, not only to change the conditions but in order to change yourselves and make
      yourselves fit for political rule,” you say on the contrary: “We must come to power right away, or else we might

<a class="calibre6" id="page_79"></a>On the practical side, this principle on how the proletariat becomes “fit for political rule”
      also makes the revolutionary fit for waiting out and working through periods of nonrevolutionary struggles. Marx
      had to refer to it again in writing on two subsequent defeats of the French working class, each of which ushered
      in a difficult period for the socialists. In his study of Bonaparte’s accession to power, reviewing the 1848
      period Marx dwelt on the gap between the limited bourgeois-democratic aims of the February revolution and the
      advanced social stamp which the fighting ability of the proletariat had put on it.
