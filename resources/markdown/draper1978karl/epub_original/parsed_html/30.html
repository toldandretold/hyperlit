    HAMANN</strong>
<br class="calibre12" id="noteb--3"/>
    A note to <a class="nounder4" href="12.html#ch05" id="noteb--4">Chapter 5</a>, page 145</h2>
<div class="indent" id="noteb--5">
      There is an alleged statement by Marx on trade-union/party relations that has cropped up regularly for the last
      fifty years or so, often in efforts to prove that Marx held syndicalist or reformist views of some sort on the
      matter.<a class="calibre6" id="noteben1-r"></a><a class="nounder1" href="43.html#noteben1" id="noteb--7">*</a> According to this
      story, Marx confided these opinions for the first and only time to a total stranger during a trip abroad—a
      stranger who had arranged this meeting for his own purposes and who then proceeded to publish his own account of
      the conversation in the course of a faction fight.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="noteb--8">
      To separate the kernels of truth from the chaff, it is enough to bring the facts together. In the course of this
      inquiry we will also get a look at the German trade-union movement of the 1860s, on which we have cited Marx
      elsewhere, and we will have done an exercise in the evaluation of Marx-quotations.
    </div>
<h3 class="h2" id="noteblev1">1. A CHAT WITH STRANGERS</h3>
<div class="indent" id="noteb--10">
      In late 1869 Marx took a month off for a restorative trip to Germany with his ailing daughter Jenny, mainly for a
      stay with his friend Dr. Kugelmann in Hanover, where he stopped from September 18 to October 7. There a Hanover
      unionist named J. Hamann requested a discussion, which took place on September 30. Writing to Engels with some
      miscellaneous news, Marx included the following item:
    </div>
<div class="bqi" id="noteb--11">
<a class="calibre6" id="page_581"></a>I have <em class="calibre8" id="noteb--13">just</em> chatted away an hour with a delegation of 4 Lassalleans
      who were sent to me by the local branch of the General German Workers Association. Naturally 1 behaved in a very
      reserved and diplomatizing manner, but <em class="calibre8" id="noteb--14">sub rosa</em> I told the people what they had to be
      told. We parted good friends. Their invitation in the name of the Association, to deliver a lecture for them, I
      naturally declined.<sup class="calibre13" id="noteb--15"><a class="calibre14" id="notebfn2"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#notebfn2-r" id="noteb--17">2</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="indentt" id="noteb--18">
      This is the conversation in which Marx is supposed to have enunciated unique opinions. On the contrary, we see,
      Marx was “reserved” about his views and “diplomatized” in expressing them. That is, he was afraid that too strong
      an exposition of his criticisms of the Lassallean GGWA would disturb the delegation of “Lassalleans,” and so he
      tactfully limited himself to his essential critique of the organization.<a class="calibre6" id="noteben2-r"></a><a class="nounder1" href="43.html#noteben2" id="noteb--20">*</a> He was even gratified when, despite this critique, they “parted good
      friends.” All this means that he had not the least idea of what Hamann’s group stood for or what they were
      doing—and that Hamann did not tell him, merely posing questions for answer. It means that Marx did not even know
      that his visitors belonged to an active opposition to the GGWA leadership that was soon going to split away.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="noteb--21">
      This should not be surprising, for the ignorance was mutual. At this point Marx was apprised only of the public
      facts about the conflict in the Schweitzer movement. (It was only days later, on October 3, that Marx finally met
      with some leaders of the opposition who had joined up with Bebel and Liebknecht; Liebknecht himself was unable to
      come to Hanover.) On his part, a man like Hamann could have no idea of how Marx really felt about the Schweitzer
      leadership in the movement. This was at the tail end of a period when Schweitzer had been making overtures to the
      International and to Marx, and when publicly Marx was maintaining an attitude of neutrality between the
      Schweitzer organization and the Bebel-Liebknecht group.<sup class="calibre13" id="noteb--22"><a class="calibre14" id="notebfn3"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#notebfn3-r" id="noteb--24">3</a></sup> The result: Hamann had no reason to know that Marx
      was hostile to Schweitzer’s views, and Marx obviously assumed his visitors were Schweitzer men from the local
      Lassallean branch.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="noteb--25">
      This was not exactly the ideal situation for Marx to decide to reveal an opinion he had never expressed before!
      On the contrary, if we want to know in general what Marx told the Hanover delegation about trade-union/party
      relations, we need only look to the exposition (also <a class="calibre6" id="page_582"></a>“diplomatizing”) in Marx’s letter to
      Schweitzer himself of October 13, 1868.<sup class="calibre13" id="noteb--27"><a class="calibre14" id="notebfn4"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#notebfn4-r" id="noteb--29">4</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="indent" id="noteb--30">
      But if we want to know what Marx’s exposition meant to Hamann—and how Hamann might tend to represent Marx’s views
      to his fellow unionists who were getting ready for a crucial vote on Schweitzer’s dictatorship—we have to
      summarize the situation that faced these unionists at that very moment.
    </div>
<h3 class="h2" id="noteblev2">2. THE TRADE-UNIONISTS’ REVOLT OF 1869</h3>
<div class="indent" id="noteb--32">
      Following is a brief summary for our present limited purposes.<sup class="calibre13" id="noteb--33"><a class="calibre14" id="notebfn5"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#notebfn5-r" id="noteb--35">5</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="indent" id="noteb--36">
      The middle 1860s in Germany saw a sharp rise in strike struggles and workers’ organization. By 1868 there was a
      strike wave, and trade unions started developing rapidly. The GGWA, the only socialist organization that existed
      as yet on a national scale, was hostile to this development. Lassalleanism saw the working class essentially as
      shock troops to be mobilized by a political leadership vis-à-vis the state power. Its organizational form was a
      presidential dictatorship by statute, first under Lassalle and then under Schweitzer. In the Lassallean concept,
      any workers’ organization other than the Lassallean political party was an irrelevancy, and an organization
      independent of party control was a threat to Humanity.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="noteb--37">
      But the reality of the class struggle outside the GGWA impelled dissidents to raise their voices inside the
      organization, especially by the time of its Hamburg congress in September 1868. The congress went so far as to
      come out in favor of strikes, but recoiled at the un-Lassallean proposal that socialists should actually help to
      found trade unions; a majority voted this counterrevolutionary idea down. But Schweitzer himself was willing to
      be more flexible than the sect members whom he had helped to fossilize with “infallible” Lassallean concepts. He
      wanted to tack and veer before the storm of strikes in order to bring these unruly forces under proper control,
      instead of flatly confronting them as an enemy. He therefore set about—with the help of the cigarworkers’ leader,
      F. W. Fritzsche—to establish trade-union organizations, trade unions that would be integral cogs in his party
      empire and completely subject to his presidential dictatorship.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="noteb--38">
      Meanwhile, outside of Prussia, August Bebel and Wilhelm Liebknecht were slowly breaking with their stultifying
      course of subordinating the workers’ circles in which they had influence to the bourgeois-liberal <a class="calibre6" id="page_583"></a>People’s Party. Under continual pressure from Marx and from the intense upsurge in working-class
      struggles, Bebel and Liebknecht finally started moving toward independent class organization. Their movement
      began helping to form trade unions, but on the basis of model statutes drawn up by Bebel which established a
      pattern of organizational autonomy for the unions. These unions usually had the word “International” in their
      titles, in order to imply a link with <em class="calibre8" id="noteb--40">the</em> International even though a statutory link was
      illegal.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="noteb--41">
      When the GGWA met at Elberfeld in March 1869, the anti-Schweitzer opposition had managed to get Bebel and
      Liebknecht on the platform to present their case. To be sure, the majority upheld Schweitzer, but a third of the
      delegates abstained from voting: a bad moral defeat for him. “With this,” Engels wrote Marx with his usual
      bounce, “the disintegration process of specific Lassalleanism has begun and must proceed swiftly.”<sup class="calibre13" id="noteb--42"><a class="calibre14" id="notebfn6"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#notebfn6-r" id="noteb--44">6</a></sup> The
      congress even amended the statutes so as to reduce the presidential powers.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="noteb--45">
      After the congress the pressure on Schweitzer continued, and the “dictator” (as Engels’ letter had called him)
      panicked. On June 18 he decreed a merger with a splinter group of true-Lassalleans that the Countess Hatzfeldt
      (Lassalle’s ex-patron) had whittled off a couple of years before. This merger, uncomplicated by a membership
      vote, also restored the old presidential powers in full dictatorial splendor. The dissidents had had enough; led
      by Wilhelm Bracke, they denounced this “coup d’état” and headed toward a split. By August 7 they held a joint
      congress with the Bebel-Liebknecht forces at Eisenach and formed the Social-Democratic Workers Party
      (“Eisenachers”).
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="noteb--46">
      But even before this, the trade-unionists imprisoned in the Schweitzerian barracks had begun to revolt too.
      Fritzsche led the revolt in the cigarworkers’ union, which he had founded in 1865. Schweitzer promptly issued a
      decree removing him from office. On July 14 the GGWA Executive gave the president power to expel oppositionists
      at will. Then the racking struggle against the dictatorship spread to the metalworkers’ union.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="noteb--47">
      And this brings us to J. Hamann, the chief treasurer of the metalworkers’ union in Hanover. Not because of his
      prominence in these events—on the contrary, I cannot even verify his first name from the sources<a class="calibre6" id="noteben3-r"></a><a class="nounder1" href="43.html#noteben3" id="noteb--49">*</a>—but because, as this storm was
      coming to a head, he got the <a class="calibre6" id="page_584"></a>idea of asking the visiting leader of the International for an
      opinion on some of the issues.
    </div>
<h3 class="h2" id="noteblev3">3. BACKGROUND OF THE CONVERSATION</h3>
<div class="indent" id="noteb--52">
      The “Lassallean” metalworkers’ union (<em class="calibre8" id="noteb--53">Allgemeine Deutsche Metallarbeiterschaft</em>) had been
      founded only a year before under the leadership of Louis Schulze of Hanover, who was now the union president.
      Around the end of August 1869, Schulze went to Berlin to protest the July 14 decree, unsuccessfully, and sent a
      circular to the membership attacking the dictatorship. A Schweitzer lieutenant returned the favor with a foray
      into Hanover, the seat of the Union Executive. There was an exchange of claims about who had what majority; then
      Schulze resigned his post, with a blast against Schweitzer, thereby precipitating a new election to take the
      issue to the membership. The vote was indecisive, however, for the anti-Schweitzer vote was divided between two
      candidates. (It was about this point in the fast-breaking events that Hamann’s conversation with Marx took place;
      but let us finish this chapter of the story before returning to it.)
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="noteb--54">
      On October 9, Schweitzer called on his dictatorial powers to settle the opposition’s hash. In a long statement
      defending the central party’s control over its unions, and attacking the metalworkers’ Executive for not
      expelling Schulze as a supporter of Bebel-Liebknecht, the Lassallean pope decreed that the Executive was
      dissolved, installed his own man as president of the union, and announced a second election from which Schulze
      would be excluded. The encyclical then lambasted the followers of Bebel-Liebknecht as splitters and infiltrators,
      and called on all good members to report on other members who helped these “tools or supporters of the
      bourgeoisie.” Schweitzer ended with a paean to “unity and strength”: “Long live party unity!”
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="noteb--55">
      As Schweitzer’s man launched the inevitable witch-hunt against Schulze’s supporters, the latter looked around for
      an alternative. There was one. In mid-August another metalworkers’ union had been founded at a congress in
      Nuremberg, of the “International” type, that is, based on Bebel’s model statutes. A fusion was soon arranged
      between the dissident group of the GGWA union and the new “International” union. On November 28-30, at a congress
      in Brunswick, the two met <a class="calibre6" id="page_585"></a>together and established a new and autonomous organization, the
      Internationale Metallarbeiterschaft. The GGWA union’s treasury was brought over to the new union by J. Hamann,
      who remained chief treasurer.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="noteb--57">
      On the eve of this unity congress, in the November 27 issue of the Eisenach party’s weekly—now called the <em class="calibre8" id="noteb--58">Volksstaat</em> and still edited by Liebknecht—there is an interesting group of three items, on an
      inside page largely devoted to trade-union news, notices and other accounts. The first is a final Call to the
      members of the ex-Lassallean metalworkers’ union to attend the Brunswick congress, signed by Carl Bomm as
      business manager. The third is a report on a visit to Hanover by Schweitzer himself on the previous Sunday,
      relating how his meeting had been energetically upset by metalworkers led by Bomm, Schulze, and Hamann, who
      attacked Schweitzer from the floor and then staged a walkout.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="noteb--59">
      Sandwiched in between these two items of factional interest is—Hamann’s report on his conversation with Marx on
      issues involved (unbeknown to Marx) in this turmoil. More accurately, it is the <em class="calibre8" id="noteb--60">Volksstaat</em>’s reprint of Hamann’s report; as the first sentence shows, Hamann’s account had
      originally appeared in the union’s monthly bulletin, as part of a Call (<em class="calibre8" id="noteb--61">Aufruf</em>)—that is,
      as a direct contribution to the split, not simply as a report of general political interest.<a class="calibre6" id="noteben4-r"></a><a class="nounder1" href="43.html#noteben4" id="noteb--63">*</a>
</div>
<div class="indent" id="noteb--64">
      Following is the complete text of the item, as it was published in the <em class="calibre8" id="noteb--65">Volksstaat</em>.<sup class="calibre13" id="noteb--66"><a class="calibre14" id="notebfn9"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#notebfn9-r" id="noteb--68">9</a></sup>
</div>
<h3 class="h2" id="noteb--69">MARX ON TRADE UNIONS</h3>
<div class="bqi" id="noteb--70">
      The following appears in a Call by J. Hamann, the chief treasurer of the Allgemeine Deutsche Metallarbeiterschaft
      (see No. 4 of the trade-union organ published in Hanover): The trade unions can never and must never be made
      dependent on a political organization—this is proved to us only too clearly by the present decline of our union.
      This is also the opinion of the greatest political economist and writer now living, Dr. Karl Marx, Lassalle’s
      teacher, who stopped over in Hanover for a short time. I too could not refrain from getting personally acquainted
      with the man of science, and requested a discussion with him in order to hear the advice of this great inquirer
      into social questions and his opinions on trade unions. This was kindly vouchsafed to me; and the next day I
      visited him along with four friends, and held a <a class="calibre6" id="page_586"></a>discussion for one and a half hours. Here I
      bring out only the main points and adhere strictly to the truth.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="noteb--72">
      My first question to Dr. Karl Marx was this: Must the trade unions predominantly be dependent on a political
      organization, if they are to be viable? The answer was: “The trade unions should never be connected up with a
      political organization nor be made dependent on one, if they are to fulfill their task; should this happen, it
      means a deathblow to them. The trade unions are the schools for socialism. In the trade unions the workers are
      trained to be socialists, for there the struggle with capital is carried on before their eyes day-in day-out. All
      political parties, no matter which, without exception, inspire the masses of workers for only a temporary period
      of time, whereas the trade unions have a lasting hold on the mass of workers, only they are in a position to
      constitute a real workers’ party and set up a bulwark against the power of capital. The greater mass of the
      workers have arrived at the understanding that their material condition must be improved, no matter which party
      they want to belong to. But if the material condition of the worker is improved, then he can devote himself more
      to the upbringing of his children; his wife and children will not have to go into the factories; he himself can
      improve his mind and take better care of his body; and he then becomes a socialist without being aware of it.”
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="noteb--73">
      The second question I raised was this: Is it proper for a trade union to possess its own organ? I then explained
      that, since a while back, we had been publishing our accounts monthly in circulars, and special circumstances
      affecting the union’s interests had brought the question up for discussion, but the reproach had been hurled at
      us from various quarters that it was presumptuous and overweening, an offence against the organization, and more
      of the same. The answer was as follows: “I am not surprised to hear that; but you should not pay attention to
      such phrases; indeed, a union’s organ is the binding link; in its pages the various opinions for-and-against
      should come up for discussion, the wage conditions in the various trades should be made known, but never should
      it be the property of an individual person—rather, if it is to fulfill its purpose it must be the property of the
      collectivity. The grounds for this I need not enlarge on further, for they are so obvious that everyone must
      understand that this is one of the prime basic conditions for the trade unions to reach full flowering.”
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="noteb--74">
      Such is the opinion of this man, who is generally known to be the greatest authority in the science of political
      economy. If anyone doubts this statement, he can address himself directly to Dr. Karl Marx, 1, Modena Villas,
      Maitland Park, London, for the latter has stated he will be glad to confirm this statement of his. <a class="calibre6" id="page_587"></a>Finally, he also offers us this advice: never to attach ourselves to a person, but always keep
      one’s eyes on the issue and form our opinion on the basis of it. “It’s not Liebknecht, or Dr. Schweitzer, or
      myself that matters to you, only the issue—this is the truth.”
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="noteb--76">
      And with this statement I can only concur fully.
    </div>
<div class="right" id="noteb--77">
      J. Hamann
    </div>
<h3 class="h3a" id="noteblev4">4. THE BLURRED IMAGE</h3>
<div class="indent" id="noteb--79">
      Were it not for the latter-day use made of this minor polemical contribution to the 1869 fight, it would be a
      sterile business to try to deduce from its words just what Marx might have told his visitors as they sat around
      Dr. Kugelmann’s living room. This implies no accusation against Hamann’s bona fides. More knowledgeable people
      have spent more time on more of Marx’s words than Hamann was able to do, and have reported less accurately what
      they absorbed. To try to discern the original through this blurred echo of it is something like making out the
      details of an unfocused form photographed in the dusk, through a warped window, on film that already bears an
      underlay of images.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="noteb--80">
      For one thing, Hamann’s fulsome praise of Marx does not imply acquaintance with Marx’s writings or ideas. He knew
      Marx was the “greatest political economist” etc. because both sides in the socialist struggle had recently said
      so. Both Schweitzer’s and Liebknecht’s organs had published flattering notices on <em class="calibre8" id="noteb--81">Capital</em>
      and its author; the Basel Congress of the International, then at its zenith, had just taken place and had
      officially recommended Marx’s <em class="calibre8" id="noteb--82">Capital</em> to the world.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="noteb--83">
      As for the image underlay: what we have of Hamann’s ideas (brief passages of argumentation in the course of Calls
      published in the <em class="calibre8" id="noteb--84">Volksstaat</em>) suggests nothing more than an elementary reformist emphasis
      on the material aims of good trade-unionism as against excessive politicalization. In another context there would
      be little reason to stress this. Hamann was in a violently polarizing situation, where the Schweitzerites swung
      to overwhelming emphasis on the primacy of politics over immediate interests—interpreted as the primacy of the
      party leadership over the unionists—while the opposition swung to a heavy and healthy emphasis on the necessary
      autonomy of the “economic” organization and the role of the immediate struggle as an organizer of troops in the
      class struggle. Both polarizations, as they flew apart, headed in disastrous directions, as we know from the
      eventual tendencies taken on in the movement. But we can hardly expect a <a class="calibre6" id="page_588"></a>Hamann to figure
      out in advance solutions to the basic problems of the movement, when even the “theoretician” of the
      anti-Schweitzerians, namely Liebknecht, fell on his face continually, as the Marx-Engels correspondence records.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="noteb--86">
      This comment would be supererogatory except that this bedeviled Hanover metalworker, caught in the midst of a
      tumultuous split, is supposed—after a chat with Marx—to have become a reliable authority on Marx’s views, even if
      they had not been communicated in a “reserved and diplomatizing manner.” This reflects not on Hamann himself but
      only on the authorities who quote his squib with the same gravity as they quote from the <em class="calibre8" id="noteb--87">Communist Manifesto.</em>
</div>
<div class="indent" id="noteb--88">
      Hamann’s use of quotation marks should not be understood as a claim that he had transcribed Marx’s exact words.
      It is a fact—a deplorable fact—that it was common practice to use quote marks for paraphrased summaries, not only
      in popular journalism but even in more serious places.<a class="calibre6" id="noteben5-r"></a><a class="nounder1" href="43.html#noteben5" id="noteb--90">*</a> Hamann is honestly giving his own summary of what he had gathered from Marx’s
      conversation. As he said, he was bringing out “only the main points.”
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="noteb--91">
      The main point dealt with the subordination of the trade unions to the organizational discipline of the political
      party, as against the trade union’s need for organizational autonomy. Schweitzer stood for the first, the
      opposition for the second; and on this main issue, Marx’s position was strongly and unequivocally on the side of
      the opposition. This was what Hamann discovered during the conversation; and on this he was quite right. But as
      soon as we get beyond this, things get blurry.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="noteb--92">
      The primitiveness of Hamann’s grasp of the other issues is shown by the first sentence he ascribes to Marx: “The
      trade unions should never be connected up [<em class="calibre8" id="noteb--93">in Zusammenhang gebracht</em>] with a political
      organization nor be made dependent on one …” Here two different thoughts are treated as interchangeable. The
      International was precisely a format for bringing trade unions into a <em class="calibre8" id="noteb--94">connection</em> with the
      political movement, a type of connection alien to Lassalleanism. Marx was then at the height of accomplishing,
      very publicly, precisely what Hamann’s report has him warning against, if the words are taken seriously. It is
      this obviously garbled paraphrase which later was taken to be evidence that Marx favored what came to be called
      the “neutrality” of trade unions <a class="calibre6" id="page_589"></a>in politics—a conception which is the mirror image of
      Schweitzer’s political barracks-control.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="noteb--96">
      The other element in the Hamann report that is most clearly garbled is the sentence in which Marx is supposed to
      say that <em class="calibre8" id="noteb--97">only</em> the trade unions “are in a position to institute a real workers
      party.”<a class="calibre6" id="noteben6-r"></a><a class="nounder1" href="43.html#noteben6" id="noteb--99">*</a> Marx could not
      possibly have made any such generalization. A bare five weeks before this conversation, Marx’s friends along with
      Hamann’s had just constituted a real workers’ party, at Eisenach—and not at all on the organizational basis of
      trade unions. It is possible to speculate what Hamann heard that came off his pen in this form (perhaps the idea
      that a trade-union basis was one way for a workers’ party to come into existence), but such speculation is only a

      On the other hand, there are shards of Marxiana in this report of Hamann’s which sound quite authentic, as one
      might expect: “The trade unions are the schools of socialism,” and so on. Marx’s warning against the cult of
      personality was directed against the cult of Lassalle as much as of Schweitzer; he had said as much elsewhere.
      But there is nothing new to be learned.

      The “authenticity” of the Hamann report is sometimes taken as proved by the fact that Marx sent in no correction,
      although he probably saw it in the paper.<a class="calibre6" id="noteben7-r"></a><a class="nounder1" href="43.html#noteben7" id="noteb--103">*</a><a class="calibre6" id="noteben8-r"></a><a class="nounder1" href="43.html#noteben8" id="noteb--105">*</a>
      But if the circumstances are understood, <a class="calibre6" id="page_590"></a>it is clear that there was nothing much for him to
      correct that would have seemed important at the time. It is not reasonable to credit Marx with sufficient ESP to
      anticipate the future triumphs of marxology in the interpretation of Marx-quotes. It was enough for Marx that
      readers of Hamann’s report in the difficult situation of 1869 would have been moved a step in the right direction
      by its concrete meaning for the ongoing struggle.
