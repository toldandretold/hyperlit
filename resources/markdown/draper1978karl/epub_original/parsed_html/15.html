<div class="indent" id="ch07--2">
      When Marx first confronted the problem of changing society, the revolution that loomed large was not the
      proletarian revolution but the bourgeois revolution: the revolutionary change needed to abolish the legacy of
      feudalism and the regime of absolutism, and to put the bourgeoisie<a class="calibre6" id="ch07en1-r"></a><a class="nounder1" href="43.html#ch07en1" id="ch07--4">*</a> in direct control of the state. Our discussion of Bonapartism<sup class="calibre13" id="ch07--5"><a class="calibre14" id="ch07fn2"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch07fn2-r" id="ch07--7">2</a></sup> has already
      raised some questions about the revolutionary role of the bourgeoisie in this, its own revolution. In this
      chapter we will be particularly concerned with the relation between the bourgeois revolution and the proletarian
      socialist revolution. This is a complex of problems on which Marx’s theory of revolution went through a number of
      alterations as it developed. It can be understood only step by step.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch07--8">
      This question was fated to be one of the most controversial of the ensuing century; and so the nature of Marx’s
      views is often obscured by the dust of later disputes. The reader is urged to resist a common tendency to view
      Marx’s ideas through the prism of the discussions on permanent revolution and bourgeois-democratic revolution
      that raged in the Russian socialist movement in the first two decades of the twentieth century. All of the
      Russian-born theories—Trotsky’s on permanent revolution, Lenin’s on “democratic dictatorship of the <a class="calibre6" id="page_170"></a>proletariat and peasantry,” and the Mensheviks’ on bourgeois-revolution-first—appealed to Marx’s
      authority as usual; but it is doubtful that any of them fully grasped Marx’s views. Besides, it is useful to
      repeat that phrases and formulations used a half century apart, under differing social conditions, do not
      necessarily have exactly the same content; a concrete examination must be made.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch07--10">
      The twentieth-century controversy is outside our purview, but out of these disputes came a common marxological
      myth. The myth had it that only in a momentary aberration in 1850 did Marx discount the revolutionary character
      of the bourgeoisie in this type of historical situation. In point of fact, Marx, along with many other
      revolutionaries of the day, started out in 1843 with a rejection of the bourgeoisie’s revolutionary potentiality.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch07--11">
      For this we must go back to the essay in which he first identified the proletariat as the bearer of the socialist
      revolution, his introduction to a critique of Hegel’s political thought.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch07--12"><a class="calibre14" id="ch07fn3"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch07fn3-r" id="ch07--14">3</a></sup>
</div>
<h3 class="h2" id="ch07lev1">1. MARX’S STARTING POINT IN 1843</h3>
<div class="indent" id="ch07--16">
      In this early article Marx raised a question that had to be resolved before nominating the proletariat as the
      revolutionary class: <em class="calibre8" id="ch07--17">what about the bourgeoisie?</em> After all, it was a question of
      absolutist Germany, where the bourgeoisie was not in power and suffered from the rule of obsolete classes.
      Whatever one thought of the potentiality of the proletariat, wasn’t the bourgeoisie a revolutionary class in its
      own way and for its own aims?
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch07--18">
      Marx’s answer here is no. In fact, his argument closely links his thesis that the proletariat is <em class="calibre8" id="ch07--19">the</em> revolutionary class with the opinion that the bourgeoisie is not revolutionary at all. He
      does not yet seem to consider that there may be more than one revolutionary class, on different levels.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch07--20">
      He does recognize that the bourgeoisie was the revolutionary class in the France of 1789, but thinks this is no
      longer so since it now holds political power in that country. The French pattern (on which he has just been
      reading widely) as well as the English suggests that backward Germany may be slated to go through the same
      stages. It is to this suggestion that Marx firmly answers no: the German bourgeoisie has <a class="calibre6" id="page_171"></a>already missed its historic opportunity to be the revolutionary class of the nation. Clearly
      involved in Marx’s argument is a concept of “uneven and combined development” (to use a later term).
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch07--22">
      He sees the German bourgeoisie as virtually inert. It has negated its historic revolutionary role through
      timidity and cowardice. He notes that “other nations dared to carry out a revolution” but “our rulers were
      afraid” to do so; while we do not enjoy the benefits of others’ revolutions, we do suffer from their
      counterrevolutions. Running through all of German society are the legitimation of baseness, the ancestral knout,
      despicable phenomena of all sorts, wretchedness in government.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch07--23"><a class="calibre14" id="ch07fn4"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch07fn4-r" id="ch07--25">4</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="indent" id="ch07--26">
      In France and England this problem is posed in a modern way, because a partial emancipation has already taken
      place there: industry and wealth (the bourgeoisie) have emancipated themselves from the old political world, from
      semifeudal absolutism. “In France and England, then, it is a matter of abolishing monopoly [<em class="calibre8" id="ch07--27">understand</em>: capitalism] that has proceeded to its final consequences [<em class="calibre8" id="ch07--28">at any
      rate</em>, <em class="calibre8" id="ch07--29">to bourgeois political power</em>]; in Germany it is a matter of going on to the
      final consequence of monopoly. There it is a question of solution, and here [in Germany] it is first a question
      of collision.”<sup class="calibre13" id="ch07--30"><a class="calibre14" id="ch07fn5"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch07fn5-r" id="ch07--32">5</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="indent" id="ch07--33">
      But, continues Marx’s argument, if that were all there was to it, then Germany’s perspective would be like
      Russia’s: no revolutionary prospect at all as yet. But in fact Germany’s development has been uneven: “they are
      about to begin in Germany with what France and Germany are about to end.” For “the <em class="calibre8" id="ch07--34">total</em>
      German development goes beyond the <em class="calibre8" id="ch07--35">political</em> German development.” For example, the
      theoretical conceptions that have become rife in Germany, mainly in philosophic guise, are the fruit not merely
      of the backward German conditions but of the advanced European conditions to the west. Thus there is a force at
      work, theory, which is a part of the total German development, for “theory too becomes a material force as soon
      as it grips the masses.”<sup class="calibre13" id="ch07--36"><a class="calibre14" id="ch07fn6"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch07fn6-r" id="ch07--38">6</a></sup><a class="calibre6" id="ch07en2-r"></a><a class="nounder1" href="43.html#ch07en2" id="ch07--40">*</a>
</div>
<div class="indent" id="ch07--41">
<a class="calibre6" id="page_172"></a>But will it be possible to bridge the “enormous discrepancy” between theory and social
      reality in Germany? “The question is posed: can Germany attain a practice” which is on a level with its best
      theory, can it make a revolution which will raise it not only to the height already attained by France and
      England “but to the <em class="calibre8" id="ch07--43">human height</em> which will be the immediate future of these nations”?
      That is: can it make not merely a partial (bourgeois-democratic) revolution but the basic “radical revolution”
      which will go even beyond the bourgeois stage reached in France and England?<sup class="calibre13" id="ch07--44"><a class="calibre14" id="ch07fn9"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch07fn2-r" id="ch07--46">9</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="indent" id="ch07--47">
      Marx is aware that posing this possibility should give one pause: “But Germany has not climbed up to the
      intermediate stages of political emancipation along with the modern nations. … How can it, with a <em class="calibre8" id="ch07--48">salto mortale</em> [daring leap], jump not only over its own limitations but at the same time over the
      limitations of the modern nations … ?” The premises for such a “radical revolution” appear to be lacking.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch07--49"><a class="calibre14" id="ch07fn10"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch07fn10-r" id="ch07--51">10</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="indent" id="ch07--52">
      To help make the leap, Marx points to another element of uneven and combined development in the total German
      picture: Germany, to be sure, has not had its share of modern political struggles, but it <em class="calibre8" id="ch07--53">has</em> “shared the <em class="calibre8" id="ch07--54">sufferings</em> of that development, without sharing its
      gratifications and partial satisfactions.”
    </div>
<div class="bq" id="ch07--55">
      So one day Germany will find itself on the level of European decadence before it ever stood on the level of
      European emancipation. It will be comparable to a <em class="calibre8" id="ch07--56">fetish worshiper</em> who languishes away
      from the diseases of Christianity.
    </div>
<div class="noindent" id="ch07--57">
      Hence the German regimes
    </div>
<div class="bq" id="ch07--58">
      are driven to combine the <em class="calibre8" id="ch07--59">civilized defects</em> of the <em class="calibre8" id="ch07--60">modern political
      world</em>, whose advantages we do not possess, with the <em class="calibre8" id="ch07--61">barbarous defects</em> of the <em class="calibre8" id="ch07--62">ancien regime</em>, which we enjoy in full…
    </div>
<div class="noindent" id="ch07--63">
      It is this combined development which brings about the peculiar situation that this backward Germany naively
      “shares all the illusions of the constitutional political system without sharing its realities.” This
      “eclecticism” (Marx’s label for this combination of unevenly developed elements) “will reach a height undreamed
      of before,” as is shown by the case of Prussia’s king “who proposes to play all the roles of monarchy, feudal and
      bureaucratic, absolute and constitutional, autocratic and democratic” at the same time in his own person.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch07--64"><a class="calibre14" id="ch07fn11"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch07fn11-r" id="ch07--66">11</a></sup>

<a class="calibre6" id="page_173"></a>The conclusion:

<em class="calibre8" id="ch07--70">Germany</em>, <em class="calibre8" id="ch07--71">representing the defect of the political present erected into a
      whole world of its own</em>, will not be able to break down the specifically German limitations without breaking
      down the general limitation of the political present.
    </div>
<div class="noindent" id="ch07--72">
      That is the first flat statement: Germany will not be able to get rid of its absolutist holdovers from feudalism
      without at the same time going further.
    </div>
<div class="bqi2" id="ch07--73">
      It is not the <em class="calibre8" id="ch07--74">radical</em> revolution that is a utopian dream for Germany, not <em class="calibre8" id="ch07--75">general human</em> emancipation, but rather the partial, the <em class="calibre8" id="ch07--76">merely</em> political
      revolution, the revolution that leaves the pillars of the house standing.
    </div>
<div class="noindentt" id="ch07--77">
      This partial, merely political revolution would mean only the emancipation of “part of civil society” (the
      bourgeoisie), whereas Marx is directing the argument to the necessity of “the general emancipation of
      society.”<sup class="calibre13" id="ch07--78"><a class="calibre14" id="ch07fn12"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch07fn12-r" id="ch07--80">12</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="indent" id="ch07--81">
      At this point we get one of the better-known passages: only that class can emancipate the whole of society which
      is identified as the general representative of all of society. Marx continues:
    </div>
<div class="bqi" id="ch07--82">
      But every particular class in Germany lacks the consistency, incisiveness, courage, and ruthlessness that could
      stamp it as the negative representative of society. Not only that, but every rank of society likewise lacks that
      breadth of soul that identifies itself, if only for the moment, with the soul of the people …<sup class="calibre13" id="ch07--83"><a class="calibre14" id="ch07fn13"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch07fn13-r" id="ch07--85">13</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="noindent" id="ch07--86">
      Most particularly the German bourgeoisie lacks these qualities, which once made the French bourgeoisie the
      revolutionary representative of its society. In contrast, in Germany
    </div>
<div class="bq" id="ch07--87">
      even the opportunity for playing a great role is always already past before it is present, and every class is
      involved in the struggle against the class below it as soon as it begins a struggle against the class above it.
      Hence the princes get into a struggle against the monarchy, the bureaucrats against the nobility, and the
      bourgeoisie against all of them, while the proletariat is already beginning to get into a struggle against the
      bourgeoisie. The middle class hardly dares to conceive the idea of emancipation from its own standpoint when the
      development of social conditions along with the progress of political theory pronounces that standpoint itself to
      be antiquated or at least problematic.
    </div>
<div class="noindent" id="ch07--88">
<a class="calibre6" id="page_174"></a>That is another flat statement that the bourgeoisie cannot make its own revolution,
      qualified at the end (“at least problematic”). But the qualification fades as Marx contrasts France with Germany:
    </div>
<div class="bq" id="ch07--90">
      In France partial emancipation is the basis of universal emancipation. [<em class="calibre8" id="ch07--91">That is, the already
      accomplished bourgeois revolution is the basis for the coming universal one.</em>] In Germany universal
      emancipation is the conditio sine qua non of any partial emancipation. [<em class="calibre8" id="ch07--92">That is, here a
      complete social revolution is the condition for winning even bourgeois political democracy.</em>] In France it is
      the reality, in Germany it is the impossibility, of stage-by-stage liberation that must give birth to complete
      freedom.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch07--93"><a class="calibre14" id="ch07fn14"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch07fn14-r" id="ch07--95">14</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="indent" id="ch07--96">
      We now have the assertion of a flat impossibility. It is on the basis of this line of thought that Marx goes on
      to the more famous passage in which he first points to the proletariat as the class that can do <em class="calibre8" id="ch07--97">what the bourgeoisie cannot do.</em><sup class="calibre13" id="ch07--98"><a class="calibre14" id="ch07fn15"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch07fn15-r" id="ch07--100">15</a></sup> This despite the fact that “The proletariat is just beginning
      to come into existence in Germany only now as a result of the rising <em class="calibre8" id="ch07--101">industrial</em>
      movement.” (Not even the Silesian weavers’ revolt has yet taken place.) The conclusion is:
    </div>
<div class="bq" id="ch07--102">
      In Germany <em class="calibre8" id="ch07--103">no</em> kind of bondage can be broken without breaking <em class="calibre8" id="ch07--104">every</em> kind of bondage. <em class="calibre8" id="ch07--105">Fundamental-minded</em> Germany cannot revolutionize
      without revolutionizing <em class="calibre8" id="ch07--106">from the foundation up.</em>
</div>
<div class="noindent" id="ch07--107">
      And then a last sentence expects that this revolution will begin in France and subsequently arouse
      Germany.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch07--108"><a class="calibre14" id="ch07fn16"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch07fn16-r" id="ch07--110">16</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="indent" id="ch07--111">
      While Marx thus started with what was essentially a primitive theory of permanent revolution, we will see that he
      proceeded to go through a complex course of rethinking in the course of experience, first circling away from this
      view, before coming squarely back to it in a more sophisticated form, as the outcome of the revolution of
      1848-1849. In all this Engels’ role was more important than is usually realized.
    </div>
<h3 class="h2" id="ch07lev2">2. DEMOCRACY AND COMMUNISM</h3>
<div class="indent" id="ch07--113">
      Marx’s view, that the coming revolution in Germany could only take place under the aegis of the proletariat, was
      amended in the course of the 1840s. One factor was not merely some theoretical deduction about the bourgeoisie,
      but the bourgeoisie’s own behavior.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch07--114">
<a class="calibre6" id="page_175"></a>The image held by Marx in 1843 of the German bourgeoisie as an inert class had been largely
      true until about 1840.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch07--116"><a class="calibre14" id="ch07fn17"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch07fn17-r" id="ch07--118">17</a></sup> This was one reason why the eatly socialists tended to dismiss it as a
      potentially revolutionary force. “The year 1840 was a turning-point in the history of Germany,” Marx and Engels
      wrote later.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch07--119"><a class="calibre14" id="ch07fn18"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch07fn18-r" id="ch07--121">18</a></sup> By 1843 there had already been some significant oppositional stirrings of
      liberalism; still, by the middle forties the bourgeoisie was clearly showing how timid it was for all that. In
      contrast, in June 1844 the first attention-compelling workers’ revolts took place in Germany (Silesia and
      Bohemia). In the midst of these events, therefore, the picture was blurry. It was not until 1846-1847 that the
      movement of bourgeois liberalism got moving quite visibly.<a class="calibre6" id="ch07en3-r"></a><a class="nounder1" href="43.html#ch07en3" id="ch07--123">*</a> Let us keep this time sequence in mind as we trace Marx’s and Engels’ view of the
      question. Their ideas on the subject did not evolve simply in their skulls, but in reaction to events whose
      meaning was not immediately plain.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch07--124">
      In the spring of 1845 Engels was assuming, like Marx, that the “imminent” social revolution (coming “in a very
      short time,” too) could not be stopped by any bourgeois advances, and that it would go right through to the goal
      of “the Community system” (“communism”).<sup class="calibre13" id="ch07--125"><a class="calibre14" id="ch07fn20"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch07fn20-r" id="ch07--127">20</a></sup> In the fall, when, as we have seen,<sup class="calibre13" id="ch07--128"><a class="calibre14" id="ch07fn21"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch07fn21-r" id="ch07--130">21</a></sup> Engels became quite clear
      that it was the proletariat that would have to carry through the social revolution, he embodied this view in a
      context which left no room for a first-stage bourgeois revolution:
    </div>
<div class="bq" id="ch07--131">
      °° … we do not count on the middle classes at all. The movement of the proletarians has developed itself with
      such astonishing rapidity, that in another year or two we shall be able to muster a glorious array of working
      [-class] Democrats and Communists— for in this country [Germany] Democracy and Communism are, as far as the
      working classes are concerned, quite synonymous.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch07--132"><a class="calibre14" id="ch07fn22"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch07fn22-r" id="ch07--134">22</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="noindent" id="ch07--135">
      And he contrasts “the movement” with the bourgeois-liberal agitation for merely constitutional rights.
    </div>
<div class="indentb" id="ch07--136">
      Engels’ blanket identification of “Democracy and Communism” is the keynote here. It asserts the <em class="calibre8" id="ch07--137">telescoping</em> of the two tasks before Germany: the establishment of democratic institutions and
      the abolition <a class="calibre6" id="page_176"></a>of capitalism along with absolutism. At the end of 1845 Engels enlarges on
      this theme in an important statement which begins by pointing to the “social” (not merely political-democratic)
      side of the French Revolution:
    </div>
<div class="alpha-list" id="ch07--139">
      The French Revolution was from beginning to end a social movement, and since then a purely political democracy
      has altogether become an impossible chimera.
    </div>
<div class="bqi2" id="ch07--140">
<em class="calibre8" id="ch07--141">Democracy nowadays is communism.</em> Any other democracy can still exist only in the heads of
      theoretical visionaries who do not bother their heads about what is really happening, for whom principles are not
      developed by men and circumstances but arise out of themselves. Democracy has become the proletarian principle,
      the principle of the masses. … The democratic masses can be confidently counted in when reckoning up the
      communist forces. And when the proletarian parties of the various nations get together, they are entirely right
      in inscribing the word “Democracy” on their banners, for, with exceptions that don’t count, all European
      Democrats in the year 1846 are more or less clear communists.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch07--142"><a class="calibre14" id="ch07fn23"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch07fn23-r" id="ch07--144">23</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="indentt" id="ch07--145">
      It is vital to understand that at this time “Democracy” did not mean only certain political ideas or “values” or
      procedures, but rather primarily a political <em class="calibre8" id="ch07--146">movement</em> or <em class="calibre8" id="ch07--147">tendency</em>, aiming to put power in the hands of the People in one sense or another.<a class="calibre6" id="ch07en4-r"></a><a class="nounder1" href="43.html#ch07en4" id="ch07--149">*</a> In the socialist language of the
      day, a “pure democracy” meant a pure-and-simple democracy, a purely political democracy, which might give the
      bourgeoisie what it wanted but offered nothing to satisfy the social aspirations of the masses; hence “Democracy”
      must be a social movement too, a movement for deeper social change.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch07--150">
      This is an “algebraic” conception: the Democratic <em class="calibre8" id="ch07--151">x</em> was given one meaning by the

      By 1846, for the reasons already given, we first find Engels conceding that the bourgeoisie is going to play a
      revolutionary role to some extent at least. Now we get a two-stage view of the course of the revolution: in the
      first stage the bourgeoisie wins political power for itself; in the second stage, which follows immediately, the
      working class proceeds to overthrow the bourgeoisie. But there is no stopping point between the two stages; they
      flow into each other continuously.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch07--160">
      Here is how Engels puts it in March 1846. First he explains very clearly the difference between democracy as
      conceived and practiced by the bourgeoisie, which makes democratic rights dependent on wealth, and the democratic
      conceptions of the proletarian movement. Then:
    </div>
<div class="bq" id="ch07--161">
      °°in all countries, during the time from 1815 to 1830, the essentially democratic movement of the working
      classes, was more or less made subservient to the liberal movement of the bourgeois. The working people, though
      more advanced than the middle classes, could not yet see the total difference between liberalism and
      democracy—emancipation of the middle classes and emancipation of the working classes; they could not see the
      difference between liberty of <em class="calibre8" id="ch07--162">money</em> and liberty of <em class="calibre8" id="ch07--163">man</em>, until
      money had been made politically free, until the middle class had been made the exclusively ruling class. … In all
      countries the middle classes were, from 1815 to 1830, the most powerful component, and, therefore, the leaders of
      the revolutionary party. The working classes are necessarily the instruments in the hands of the middle classes,
      as long as the middle classes are <em class="calibre8" id="ch07--164">themselves revolutionary</em> or progressive. The distinct
      movement of the working classes is, therefore, in this case always of secondary <a class="calibre6" id="page_178"></a>importance.
      But from that very day when the middle classes obtain full political power—from the day on which all feudal and
      aristocratic interests are annihilated by the power of <em class="calibre8" id="ch07--166">money—</em>from the day on which the
      middle classes <em class="calibre8" id="ch07--167">cease</em> to be progressive and revolutionary, and become stationary
      themselves, from that very day the working class movement takes the lead and becomes the <em class="calibre8" id="ch07--168">national movement.</em><sup class="calibre13" id="ch07--169"><a class="calibre14" id="ch07fn27"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch07fn27-r" id="ch07--171">27</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="indent" id="ch07--172">
      “Democracy”—the goal of <em class="calibre8" id="ch07--173">the Democracy</em>, the social program of the masses—is still equated
      with the proletarian revolutionary movement and not with the bourgeois movement, which is “liberalism.” This has
      not changed. But the revolution is now envisaged as going through a necessary stage in which the “progressive and
      revolutionary” bourgeoisie exhausts its progressiveness by winning power, so that the revolution must <em class="calibre8" id="ch07--174">continue on</em> beyond this stage in order to gain real Democracy, which is “the liberty of <em class="calibre8" id="ch07--175">man,”</em> not of money—that is, communism.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch07--176">
      So Engels; no reliable expression of Marx’s thinking on this subject at this time is extant.<a class="calibre6" id="ch07en5-r"></a><a class="nounder1" href="43.html#ch07en5" id="ch07--178">*</a> However, since the spring of 1845
      Marx and Engels had worked together closely in Brussels, not only on their joint literary work but also as
      movement activists. Their organizational activity was simultaneously on three levels: building a communist
      political center (first the Communist Correspondence Committee, later the Communist League); building the German
      Workers Educational Union, a broader proletarian club; and building the left-wing Democratic movement (the
      International Democratic Union in Brussels, then the Democratic Association, and cooperating with the Fraternal
      Democrats organized by the London left Chartists).
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch07--179">
<a class="calibre6" id="page_179"></a>This organizational pattern should be seen from the vantage point of Engels’ explanations
      about the relationship of Democracy and Communism. The Democratic organizations involved were definitely not
      bourgeois-liberal in political character; rather, they united Communists, revolutionary workers, and
      nonproletarian Democrats who were willing to go at least part of the way with the Communists. In 1845-1846 the
      Communist group around Marx in Brussels was signing itself the “Democratic Communists,”<sup class="calibre13" id="ch07--181"><a class="calibre14" id="ch07fn32"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch07fn32-r" id="ch07--183">32</a></sup> and a Brussels police
      report on Marx identified him as a “dangerous Democrat and Communist.”<sup class="calibre13" id="ch07--184"><a class="calibre14" id="ch07fn33"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch07fn33-r" id="ch07--186">33</a></sup>

<div class="indent" id="ch07--187">
      By 1847 the Prussian bourgeoisie had forced a sort of constitution out of the king, and the convocation of the
      Diet had accelerated the pace of events. In March, Engels (also Marx later in the year) had no doubt that the
      bourgeoisie was going to take political power in short order. They “are almost forced by circumstances to change
      the governmental system” in spite of their “indolence.” Engels added: “There is, besides, no doubt, that, under
      present circumstances, the people will support the middle classes, and by their pressure from without, which
      indeed is very much wanted, strengthen the courage and enliven the energies of those within.” The economic
      distress of the people would ensure this. Outside of this greater emphasis on the bourgeoisie’s playing out its
      revolutionary role, Engels’ picture of the course of the revolution remained unchanged. The “Democratic movement”
      and the “Democratic party” were still counterposed to the movement of the bourgeoisie, not identified with it.

<div class="bq" id="ch07--188">
      °°From the moment, however, the middle classes establish their own government, identify themselves with a new
      despotism and aristocracy against the people, from that moment democracy takes its stand as the only, the
      exclusive movement party; from that moment the struggle is simplified, reduced to two parties, and changes, by
      that circumstance, into a “war to the knife.”<sup class="calibre13" id="ch07--189"><a class="calibre14" id="ch07fn34"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch07fn34-r" id="ch07--191">34</a></sup>

<div class="indent" id="ch07--193">
      We must now take into account a new factor which gave Marx and Engels a considerable push toward increased
      emphasis on the revolutionary role of the bourgeoisie, that is, the expectation that it would <a class="calibre6" id="page_180"></a>play a leading part in overthrowing absolutism and its old ruling classes.

<div class="indent" id="ch07--195">
      They found they had to combat a dangerous tendency among the petty-bourgeois socialists—encouraged by the
      regime—to utilize the antibourgeois hatred of the workers <em class="calibre8" id="ch07--196">in order to mobilize them on the
      side of the more reactionary class still in power.</em> Concentrating on the new evils brought by bourgeois
      development and exploitation, this tendency pointed to the bourgeoisie as the enemy, and told the workers:
      <em class="calibre8" id="ch07--197">The enemy of your enemy is your friend.</em> <a class="calibre6" id="ch07en6-r"></a><a class="nounder1" href="43.html#ch07en6" id="ch07--199">*</a> As Engels wrote in his draft for the Manifesto: “From the ills of
      present-day society this group draws the conclusion that feudal and patriarchal society should be restored
      because it was free from these ills.”<sup class="calibre13" id="ch07--200"><a class="calibre14" id="ch07fn40"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch07fn40-r" id="ch07--202">40</a></sup> This was not the first, and would not be the last, time that this ploy was
      worked in order to mobilize support for a more reactionary force against a more immediate exploiter.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch07--203">
      This “reactionary socialism,” or “feudal socialism,” came especially from a tendency calling itself the “True
      Socialists.” In the spring of 1847 Engels wrote a pamphlet against this tendency, but only two sections of his
      manuscript are extant. In one of them he argues that the absolute monarchy can be overthrown only by the
      bourgeoisie, and not by petty-bourgeois elements who are in the tow of the feudalists.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch07--204"><a class="calibre14" id="ch07fn41"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch07fn41-r" id="ch07--206">41</a></sup> In this connection he has
      a significant paragraph about the German working class. For the first time he states clearly that, in its present
      socioeconomic stage of development, it cannot <em class="calibre8" id="ch07--207">as yet</em> take over the leadership role in the
      revolution.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch07--208">
      There are two counts against it, he writes. It is too “split up” into different economic sectors, and it is too
      thinly scattered over the big country, with few concentration points. These characteristics make it <a class="calibre6" id="page_181"></a>difficult for it “to constitute itself into <em class="calibre8" id="ch07--210">one</em> class,” that is, to
      constitute itself into one united class political movement. “So little is the mass of workers in Germany prepared
      to take over leadership in public affairs.”<sup class="calibre13" id="ch07--211"><a class="calibre14" id="ch07fn42"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch07fn42-r" id="ch07--213">42</a></sup>

      Thus the issue is posed that will be the main subject of this and the following three chapters, as well as of
      innumerable basic disputes in the socialist movement.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch07--215">
      A couple of months later, Engels brought out another reason why the stage of bourgeois power must be gone through
      first:
    </div>
<div class="bqi" id="ch07--216">
      Only when a <em class="calibre8" id="ch07--217">single</em> class—the bourgeoisie—stands forth as the exploiter and oppressor;
      only when poverty and misery can no longer be written down to the account of one social estate now and another
      one at another time, or simply of the unlimited monarchy together with its bureaucrats: only then ensues the last
      decisive struggle … between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch07--218"><a class="calibre14" id="ch07fn43"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch07fn43-r" id="ch07--220">43</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="noindent" id="ch07--221">
      The conception here is that the evils of the old system overlay and obscure the new evils of the bourgeois order,
      and must first be abolished in order to be able to concentrate all the forces of progress against the new ruling
      class, which now can no longer throw the blame for things on its own enemy, absolutism.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch07--222">
      There were other blasts the same year against the socialists who sought to channel anticapitalism into support
      for the “enemy of our enemy.” Early in the year Engels worked on, but did not finish, an attack on a number of
      True-Socialist littérateurs; among other things it castigated indifference to bourgeois “political revolutions”
      and to other political issues of interest to the bourgeoisie.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch07--223"><a class="calibre14" id="ch07fn44"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch07fn44-r" id="ch07--225">44</a></sup> Another was <a class="calibre6" id="page_182"></a>written by
      Marx’s close friend of the Communist League, Wilhelm Wolff: “Such questions and such views can come only from
      those among us who are blinded by an otherwise quite justified hatred of the bourgeoisie …” We certainly aim to
      destroy the bourgeoisie— “However, are we proletarians in Germany ready to completely transform the social
      disorder, in our own interests, i.e., can we throw out the bourgeoisie right away and put the principles of
      communism into practice?” Wolff explained why the bourgeoisie must first get rid of the absolutist regime, and
      argued that political freedoms and democratic processes are vital for the proletarian struggle to overthrow the
      bourgeoisie itself.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch07--227"><a class="calibre14" id="ch07fn45"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch07fn45-r" id="ch07--229">45</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="indent" id="ch07--230">
      The same month that Wolff’s article appeared, September, Marx entered the lists with an article directed against
      a government organ which had tried to capitalize on the line of the “True Socialists.” The title of this article,
      “The Communism of the <em class="calibre8" id="ch07--231">Rheinische Beobachter,”</em> indicated the problem: this organ of the
      reactionaries was pretending to a certain anticapitalism in order to deflect popular discontent to the
      bourgeoisie rather than to the regime. Marx, in the name of “the most revolutionary of all the revolutionary
      parties in Germany,” declared roundly that “the Communists have nothing in common” with either the profeudal
      socialists or the profeudal government organs that pushed this political line.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch07--232">
      The government paper had argued that the liberal bourgeoisie only wants to use the people as “cannon fodder” in
      order to seize state power for itself. Yes, answered Marx, we know that the bourgeoisie pursues only its own
      interests, but it is false to conclude that the popular movement is therefore “exploited by the liberal
      bourgeoisie for its own ends.”
    </div>
<div class="bqi" id="ch07--233">
      The people—or, to replace this loose and variable expression with a definite one, the proletariat—reasons
      altogether differently … The proletariat does not ask whether the people’s welfare is the main consideration or a
      secondary one to the bourgeoisie, whether they <em class="calibre8" id="ch07--234">want</em> to use the proletariat as
      cannon-fodder or not. The proletariat does not ask what the bourgeoisie merely <em class="calibre8" id="ch07--235">want</em> but

      rule of the bureaucracy, or the one which the liberals strive for, the rule of the bourgeoisie, that will offer
      it more means to attain its own ends. … the rule of the bourgeoisie not only puts entirely new weapons in the
      hands of the proletariat for the struggle <em class="calibre8" id="ch07--240">against</em> the bourgeoisie but also obtains an
      entirely different status for the proletariat, a status as a recognized party.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch07--241"><a class="calibre14" id="ch07fn47"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch07fn47-r" id="ch07--243">47</a></sup>

      The “new weapons” which the proletariat will know how to use are such institutions as “freedom of the press and
      freedom of association.” The gentlemen of the <em class="calibre8" id="ch07--245">Rheinische Beobachter</em> “imagine that the
      proletariat wishes to be helped; it does not occur to them that the proletariat expects help from no one but

<div class="indentb" id="ch07--259">
      Like Engels earlier in the year, Marx explained why the proletariat was not yet ready to take the place of the
      bourgeoisie in the overthrow of absolutism. He did this in a polemic against a democratic liberal named Heinzen,
      in October-November. On this point it was the most thorough statement to date.
    </div>
<div class="bqi2" id="ch07--260">
      … if the proletariat overthrew the political rule of the bourgeoisie, its victory would be only transitory, only
      an incident in <a class="calibre6" id="page_184"></a>the service of the <em class="calibre8" id="ch07--262">bourgeois revolution</em>, as in the
      year 1794, so long as in the course of history, in its “movement,” the material conditions have not yet been
      created which render necessary the abolition of the bourgeois mode of production and therefore also the
      definitive overthrow of bourgeois political rule. Accordingly, the Reign of Terror in France necessarily served
      only the purpose of sweeping away the remnants of feudalism from French soil with its powerful hammer-blows. The
      timidly overcareful bourgeoisie would not have completed this job in decades. The bloody action of the people
      therefore only cleared the way for it. Similarly the overthrow of the absolute monarchy would be simply a thing
      of the moment if the economic conditions for the rule of the bourgeois class have not yet attained maturity….
    </div>
<div class="bqi2" id="ch07--263">
      The property question, which is a world-historical question in “our time,” therefore takes on meaning only in the
      <em class="calibre8" id="ch07--264">modern bourgeois society.</em> The more developed this society is, the more therefore the
      bourgeoisie has developed economically in a country, and the more state power has assumed a bourgeois expression,

      But why should the German workers prefer “the <em class="calibre8" id="ch07--270">direct rule of the bourgeoisie</em> to the
      brutal oppression of the absolute government”? Essentially Marx gave the answers we have already seen.<a class="calibre6" id="ch07en8-r"></a><a class="nounder1" href="43.html#ch07en8" id="ch07--272">*</a> This passage ended as follows:

      This article also devoted some emphasis to the reluctance of the bourgeoisie to fight for fear of the class

      18431844, with which we began this chapter:
    </div>
<div class="bqi" id="ch07--283">
      As I have already pointed out in [that article], Germany has a Christian-Germanic blight of its own. Its
      bourgeoisie was so retarded that it is beginning its struggle with the absolute monarchy and seeking to establish
      its own political power at a time when in all developed countries the bourgeoisie is already engaged in the
      sharpest struggles with the working class and its political illusions are already outlived in the consciousness
      of Europe. In this country where the political squalor of the absolute monarchy still exists together with a
      whole retinue of decayed semifeudal social orders and relations, yet on the other hand—partially indeed as a
      result of industrial development and Germany’s dependence on the world market—there exist the modern antagonisms,
      between bourgeoisie and working class and the struggle that arises therefrom: for example, the workers’ revolts
      in Silesia and Bohemia. Therefore the German bourgeoisie already finds itself in a position of antagonism to the
      proletariat before it has yet constituted itself politically as a class.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch07--284"><a class="calibre14" id="ch07fn54"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch07fn54-r" id="ch07--286">54</a></sup>

<div class="indentb" id="ch07--287">
      This lays the basis for what was actually going to happen in the coming revolution, though Marx does not yet see
      the full import of his own point. Here is another passage from Marx’s exposition:
    </div>
<div class="alpha-list" id="ch07--288">
      They [the bourgeoisie] know better [than Heinzen] where the shoe pinches. They know that in revolution the
      <em class="calibre8" id="ch07--289">rabble</em> becomes impertinent and starts to grab. Therefore the gentlemen of the bourgeoisie
      try as much as possible to change the <em class="calibre8" id="ch07--290">absolute</em> monarchy into a <em class="calibre8" id="ch07--291">bourgeois</em> monarchy in an amicable way without a revolution.
    </div>
<div class="bqi2" id="ch07--292">
      But in Prussia, as previously in England and France, the absolute monarchy does not let itself be bourgeoisified
      amicably. It does not abdicate amicably. Besides their personal prejudices, the princes have their hands tied by
      a whole civil, military and clerical bureaucracy—components of the absolute monarchy which by no means want to
      change their status as rulers for one as servants with respect to the bourgeoisie. For another thing, the feudal
      orders hold back; for them it is a question of To-be-or-not-to-be, that is, property or expropriation. It is
      clear that the absolute monarchy, in spite of all the servile genuflections of the bourgeoisie, perceives its
      real interests to lie on the side of these feudal orders.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch07--293"><a class="calibre14" id="ch07fn55"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch07fn55-r" id="ch07--295">55</a></sup>

      This predicted quite accurately what the 1848 revolution was soon <a class="calibre6" id="page_186"></a>going to show. But Marx
      did not resolve the implied dilemma, or even continue to discuss it here. If the bourgeoisie is afraid of making
      its own revolution, and the regime cannot otherwise be overthrown, and the proletariat is not yet ready to do the
      job, what happens to the bourgeois revolution, let alone the prospect of an immediately succeeding more radical
      Democratic revolution?

<h3 class="h2" id="ch07lev6">6. THE BLOC OF DEMOCRATIC CLASSES</h3>
<div class="indent" id="ch07--299">
      It was about this time, autumn 1847, that Engels started sketching the outline of a more complex approach to the
      problem of the coming revolution.<a class="calibre6" id="ch07en9-r"></a><a class="nounder1" href="43.html#ch07en9" id="ch07--301">*</a>

<div class="indent" id="ch07--302">
      He had already pointed out that the German proletariat was still split up, scattered, and small. This put a
      question mark over the proletariat’s ability not only to carry out the revolution against absolutism but even to
      achieve the second-stage revolution against the bourgeoisie—by itself. In a polemic against the same Heinzen,
      Engels developed a conception of the revolutionary Democracy as a <em class="calibre8" id="ch07--303">bloc of lower classes led by
      the proletariat</em>, <em class="calibre8" id="ch07--304">mobilized against the bourgeoisie as well as against absolutism</em>,
      <em class="calibre8" id="ch07--305">on the basis of a transitional type of program.</em>
</div>
<div class="indent" id="ch07--306">
      What are the tasks of the Democracy? asks Engels.
    </div>
<div class="bq" id="ch07--307">
      … its task is to make clear the oppression of the proletarians, small peasants and petty-bourgeoisie—for in
      Germany these constitute the “people”—by the bureaucracy, nobility and bourgeoisie …
    </div>
<div class="noindent" id="ch07--308">
      Note that the bourgeoisie, as before, is listed on the other side of the barricades, even though absolutism still
      has to be overthrown.
    </div>
<div class="bq" id="ch07--309">
      Its [the revolutionary Democracy’s] task is to demonstrate that the conquest of political power by the
      proletarians, small peasants and petty-bourgeoisie is the first condition for carrying out these means.
    </div>
<div class="noindent" id="ch07--310">
<a class="calibre6" id="page_187"></a>Political power is now to be conquered not by the proletariat alone but by a bloc of
      classes—proletariat, small peasantry and petty-bourgeoisie.
    </div>
<div class="bq" id="ch07--312">
      Furthermore its task is to examine to what extent one can count on the early attainment of Democracy, what means
      are available to the party, and with what other parties it must combine as long as it is too weak to stand
      alone.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch07--313"><a class="calibre14" id="ch07fn56"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch07fn56-r" id="ch07--315">56</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="indent" id="ch07--316">
      But (argues Engels) Heinzen is wrong in orienting toward the small peasants, who are least capable of
      revolutionary initiative. For six hundred years all progressive movements have stemmed from the towns. “The
      industrial proletariat of the towns has become the copestone of all modern democracy; the petty-bourgeois and
      still more the peasants are completely dependent on its initiative.” Denominating the proletariat as the
      copestone of modern democracy means assigning it the <em class="calibre8" id="ch07--317">hegemony</em> of the Democratic bloc.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch07--318">
      But the program of this Democratic revolution cannot begin by being the complete Communist program. Another kind
      of program is necessary for this stage, a transitional program.<a class="calibre6" id="ch07en10-r"></a><a class="nounder1" href="43.html#ch07en10" id="ch07--320">*</a> This is the program which all the Democrats (Communist Democrats or
      non-Communist Democrats) are prepared to support—even Heinzen, for his social-reform proposals “are such as the
      <em class="calibre8" id="ch07--321">Communists</em> themselves propose as preparation for the abolition of private property.” But
      for the Communists these measures are preparatory only:
    </div>
<div class="bq" id="ch07--322">
      They are possible as preparations, as intermediate steps transitional to the abolition of private property, but
      not otherwise.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch07--323"><a class="calibre14" id="ch07fn58"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch07fn58-r" id="ch07--325">58</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="noindentb" id="ch07--326">
      The gulf between the Communists and Heinzen is that, for the latter, these measures are final; they are the end,
      not the means; they are “not intended for a revolutionary situation but for a peaceful bourgeois situation.” On
      the contrary, these measures are impossible for a stable bourgeois situation, and the bourgeois economists who
      oppose these measures are right in maintaining this as long as they remain within the framework of the
      private-property system. But the economists’ objections “lose all force as soon as one views these social reforms
      as pure <em class="calibre8" id="ch07--327">mesures de salut public</em>, as revolutionary and transitional measures.” <a class="calibre6" id="page_188"></a>Engels then repeats this latter point: these measures must be considered
    </div>
<div class="alpha-list" id="ch07--329">
      not as final measures but as transitional <em class="calibre8" id="ch07--330">mesures de salut public</em> flowing out of the
      transitional struggle of the class itself.
    </div>
<div class="bqi2" id="ch07--331">
      For Mr. Heinzen they are without rhyme or reason, since they are put forward as wholly arbitrary, artificially
      concocted, philistine do-gooder enthusiasms …<sup class="calibre13" id="ch07--332"><a class="calibre14" id="ch07fn59"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch07fn59-r" id="ch07--334">59</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="noindentt" id="ch07--335">
      This makes Heinzen a bad Democrat; and, adds Engels, we do not attack him because he is not a Communist—we attack
      him because he is a bad Democrat.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch07--336">
      Finally, an important statement on the bloc of Communists and Democrats:
    </div>
<div class="bqi" id="ch07--337">
      The Communists, far from starting unprofitable quarrels with the Democrats under present conditions, rather come
      out at this time in all practical party questions as Democrats themselves. In all civilized countries, Democracy
      has the political rule of the proletariat as its necessary result, and the political rule of the proletariat is
      the first presupposition of all Communist measures. As long as Democracy has not yet been won, so long therefore
      do Communists and Democrats fight together, and so long are the interests of the Democrats likewise those of the
      Communists. Till then the differences between the two parties are purely theoretical in nature and can very well
      be discussed theoretically without thereby disturbing their common action in any way. It will even be possible to
      come to an understanding on many measures to be undertaken immediately after the attainment of Democracy in the
      interest of the hitherto oppressed classes, e.g., the operation of the big industries and railways by the state,
      education of all children at state expense, etc.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch07--338"><a class="calibre14" id="ch07fn60"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch07fn60-r" id="ch07--340">60</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="indent" id="ch07--341">
      It is to be noted that Engels has quite got over his earlier naive opinion that “with exceptions that don’t
      count, all European Democrats … are more or less clear Communists.”<sup class="calibre13" id="ch07--342"><a class="calibre14" id="ch07fn61"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch07fn61-r" id="ch07--344">61</a></sup> It is now a question of a
      united front between different tendencies (“parties”)—a more complicated problem. Also, Engels now believes that
      the transitional period of the revolution starts with a mixed-class state power (“the attainment of Democracy”)
      which is not yet definitively committed to establishing Communism. And finally: the state power is committed only
      to certain measures, to a transitional program which, from the Communist standpoint, is merely preliminary to a
      Communist society, but which, to be carried out, objectively necessitates going over to Communism.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch07--345">
<a class="calibre6" id="page_189"></a>The formulation of this transitional program goes through various drafts in the next few
      months, and winds up as the ten-point program at the end of <a class="nounder1" href="14.html#part02" id="ch07--347">Part II</a> of the <em class="calibre8" id="ch07--348">Communist Manifesto.</em>
</div>
<div class="indent" id="ch07--349">
      Engels’ conception of a limited bloc between the proletarian movement and the radical petty-bourgeoisie must,
      however, be distinguished from another view that still existed in the minds of the Communist League membership.
      The month before Engels’ article, this old concept had been embodied in the leading article in the <em class="calibre8" id="ch07--350">Kommunistische Zeitschrift</em>, probably written by Schapper. It views a coalition of proletariat
      and petty-bourgeoisie as natural simply because it does not see a <em class="calibre8" id="ch07--351">class</em> difference
      between the two strata, or sees it only dimly. Reflected here is still the mentality of the artisanal workers,
      who have not quite reconciled themselves to the proletarian condition of propertylessness. Schapper wrote:
    </div>
<div class="bq" id="ch07--352">
      In present-day society proletarians are all those who cannot live on their capital, the worker as well as the man
      of learning, the artist as well as the small bourgeois; and even if the small bourgeoisie still possesses some
      property, yet it is obviously approaching with giant strides the condition which will wholly put it on a par with
      the rest of the proletarians. Therefore we can already count it in our ranks, for it has as great an interest in
      guarding against a condition of complete propertylessness as we have to emerge from that condition. Let us unite,
      therefore, and both sectors can be helped.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch07--353"><a class="calibre14" id="ch07fn62"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch07fn62-r" id="ch07--355">62</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="noindent" id="ch07--356">
      Would-be Communists like Schapper had not yet established the <em class="calibre8" id="ch07--357">independence</em> of the
      proletarian standpoint from that of the petty-bourgeoisie. Engels’ program started from differences between the
      two classes, and asked whether they can march together for a while, and how far.
    </div>
<h3 class="h2" id="ch07lev7">7. THE REVOLUTIONARY DEMOCRACY AND THE PROLETARIAT</h3>
<div class="indent" id="ch07--359">
      The transitional program for the victory of the Democracy in the coming revolution, in Engels’ view, went right
      up to the outbreak of the revolution itself. He did not cease to insist that Democracy had to mean Communism
      <em class="calibre8" id="ch07--360">in the end.</em>
</div>
<div class="indentb" id="ch07--361">
      But not everything that was called “democratic” was of a piece with <a class="calibre6" id="page_190"></a>this Democracy, and he
      was at pains to keep the line clear. In November of 1847 he discussed the civil war going on in Switzerland
      between the reactionary “Sonderbund” cantons and the more modern Swiss regions. Old Switzerland (<em class="calibre8" id="ch07--363">Urschweiz</em>, the original High Alps cantons) and Norway, he comments, are two of the most backward
      regions of Europe, yet both are “democratically organized.”
    </div>
<div class="alpha-list" id="ch07--364">
      But there are democracies of various sorts, and it is very necessary for the Democrats of the civilized countries
      finally to reject responsibility for the Norwegian and Old Swiss democracy.
    </div>
<div class="bqi2" id="ch07--365">
      The Democratic movement in all civilized countries is, in the last instance, striving for the political rule of
      the proletariat….

<div class="bqi2" id="ch07--366">
      The Democracy of the civilized countries, <em class="calibre8" id="ch07--367">modern</em> Democracy, therefore has absolutely
      nothing in common with the Norwegian and Old Swiss democracy.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch07--368"><a class="calibre14" id="ch07fn63"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch07fn63-r" id="ch07--370">63</a></sup>

</div>
<div class="indent" id="ch07--374">
      Now who are these other, non-Communist but revolutionary, Democrats who are to constitute the allies in the
      coming victory of Democracy? For one thing, Marx and Engels are at this very time working hand in hand with a
      group of them in Brussels.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch07--375"><a class="calibre14" id="ch07fn65"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch07fn65-r" id="ch07--377">65</a></sup> But since Belgium is not expected to be the center of the revolution, France is
      more to the point. For this country, Engels points explicitly to the political movement around the
      left-Democratic (or Social-Democratic) organ <em class="calibre8" id="ch07--378">La Réforme</em>, whose leader is Ledru-Rollin. In
      January 1848 Engels once again repeats his view that
    </div>
<div class="bq" id="ch07--379">
      °°all modern democracy is based upon the great fact, that modern society is irreparably divided into two
      classes—the bourgeoisie … and the proletarians … [And] the acknowledged tendency of modern Democrats in all

      latter constituting the immense majority of the people …<sup class="calibre13" id="ch07--380"><a class="calibre14" id="ch07fn66"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch07fn66-r" id="ch07--382">66</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="noindent" id="ch07--383">
<a class="calibre6" id="page_191"></a>and his article identifies these forces in France as Ledru-Rollin’s movement around <em class="calibre8" id="ch07--385">La Réforme:</em>

<div class="bq" id="ch07--386">
      °°It has saved the honour, independence, and the strength of French Democracy as a distinct party. It has
      maintained the principle of the Revolution … It has asserted the rights of the working classes in opposition to
      middle-class encroachments. It has unmasked these bourgeois radicals—who would make the people believe that no
      class oppression exists—who will not see the frightful civil war of class against class in modern society,— and
      who have nothing but vain words for the working people.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch07--387"><a class="calibre14" id="ch07fn67"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch07fn67-r" id="ch07--389">67</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="noindent" id="ch07--390">
      Even immediately after the February revolution, Engels still continued to regard the <em class="calibre8" id="ch07--391">Reforme</em> group as representatives of the workers and “Communists without knowing it.”<sup class="calibre13" id="ch07--392"><a class="calibre14" id="ch07fn68"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch07fn68-r" id="ch07--394">68</a></sup> How
      disillusioned Marx and Engels were later to become with Ledru-Rollin’s politics is to be read in Marx’s <em class="calibre8" id="ch07--395">Class Struggles in France.</em> But the workers who looked to Ledru-Rollin—that is, likewise had
      illusions about him—were those who made the February and June insurrections in Paris.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch07--396">
      In their relations with these French revolutionary Democrats, Marx and Engels regarded themselves as representing
      the revolutionary Democracy across the border. For example, in the autumn of 1847 Engels contacted Louis Blanc as
      a representative of “the London, Brussels, and Rhineland Democracy,” and in this capacity informed the Frenchman
      that “You can regard M. Marx as the leader of our party (i.e., of the most advanced section of the German
      Democracy …) and his recent book against M. Proudhon as our program.”<sup class="calibre13" id="ch07--397"><a class="calibre14" id="ch07fn69"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch07fn69-r" id="ch07--399">69</a></sup> This makes very clear
      that there was no question about hiding socialist views behind a façade; for, on the one hand, Blanc was himself
      a leading French socialist, and on the other, the program embodied in Marx’s <em class="calibre8" id="ch07--400">Poverty of
      Philosophy</em> openly advocated the revolutionary overthrow of the bourgeoisie by the proletariat. The point is
      that the revolutionary Democracy was conceived as an umbrella movement uniting conscious socialists or Communists
      with those who were “Communists without knowing it.”
    </div>
<div class="indentb" id="ch07--401">
      On the eve of the revolution, in an article published January 23, 1848, Engels summarized the prerevolutionary
      period of 1847. He still believes that a compromise is no longer possible between the bourgeoisie and the regime;
      “a life-and-death struggle” between these opponents will end with the victory of the liberals.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch07--402"><a class="calibre14" id="ch07fn70"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch07fn70-r" id="ch07--404">70</a></sup> But
      then the united forces of the Democrats and Communists will move:
    </div>
<div class="bqi2" id="ch07--405">
<a class="calibre6" id="page_192"></a>We are no friends of the bourgeoisie, as is well known. But this time we do not grudge them
      their [coming] triumph. We can calmly smile at the haughty airs with which they look down, especially in Germany,
      on the apparently tiny band of Democrats and Communists.
    </div>
<div class="bqi2" id="ch07--407">
      … The gentlemen actually believe that they are working in their own behalf…. And yet nothing is more obvious than
      that they are only paving the way everywhere for <em class="calibre8" id="ch07--408">us</em>, the Democrats and Communists; that
      they will gain at most a few years of uneasy enjoyment of victory, to be forthwith overthrown in turn. Everywhere
      the proletariat stands at their rear … in France and Germany, silent and reserved but on the quiet preparing the
      downfall of the bourgeoisie …<sup class="calibre13" id="ch07--409"><a class="calibre14" id="ch07fn71"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch07fn71-r" id="ch07--411">71</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="noindentt" id="ch07--412">
      Then, with a visible assumption of brashness in the face of the “haughty airs,” Engels addresses the bourgeoisie
      rhetorically: You are working in our interest; fight on and clear the social ground for us; and
    </div>
<div class="bq" id="ch07--413">
      As a reward for that, you shall be allowed to rule for a short time … but do not forget: “The executioner stands

<h3 class="h2" id="ch07lev8">8. TRANSITION TO THE “SECOND REVOLUTION”</h3>
<div class="indent" id="ch07--418">
      The <em class="calibre8" id="ch07--419">Communist Manifesto</em> came off the press a few days afterward. But before taking it up,
      we have to go back a little way, to Engels’ draft for the Manifesto, written at about the same time as the
      polemics against Heinzen. The draft is clearer on this issue than the more circumspect Manifesto is going to be.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch07--420">
      A good deal of the draft needs no detailed review now, since it only repeats what we have already seen. In the
      coming “decisive struggle” between the bourgeoisie and absolutism, the Communists want the bourgeoisie to win,
      and as quickly as possible, “in order as soon as possible to overthrow them again.” And “from the day when the
      absolute governments fall, comes the turn for the fight between bourgeois and proletarians.” The “reactionary
      socialists” are identified as the antibourgeois but profeudal elements we have already discussed.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch07--421"><a class="calibre14" id="ch07fn73"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch07fn73-r" id="ch07--423">73</a></sup>

<div class="indent" id="ch07--424">
      The answer to Question 17 states that it will not be possible for the coming proletarian revolution to abolish
      private property “at <em class="calibre8" id="ch07--425">one</em> stroke.” The reason, however, is not simply that realistically
      this process will take some time. Rather, the proletarian revolution will “be <a class="calibre6" id="page_193"></a>able to
      abolish private property only when the necessary quantity of the means of production has been created.” One of
      the tasks of proletarian rule itself is to bring this about.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch07--427"><a class="calibre14" id="ch07fn74"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch07fn74-r" id="ch07--429">74</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="indent" id="ch07--430">
      This is the context for Question 18: “What will be the course of this revolution?” The answer is in terms of a
      specific kind of transitional period.
    </div>
<div class="bqi" id="ch07--431">
<em class="calibre8" id="ch07--432">Answer:</em> In the first place it will inaugurate a <em class="calibre8" id="ch07--433">democratic
      constitution</em> and thereby directly or indirectly the political rule of the proletariat.
    </div>
<div class="noindent" id="ch07--434">
      Indirectly in a country like Germany—
    </div>
<div class="bq" id="ch07--435">
      where the majority of the people consists not only of proletarians but also of small peasants and
      petty-bourgeois, who are only now being proletarianized and in all their political interests are becoming more
      and more dependent on the proletariat and therefore soon [<em class="calibre8" id="ch07--436">N.B.: not now</em>] will have to
      conform to the demands of the proletariat. This will perhaps involve a second fight, but one that can end only in
      the victory of the proletariat.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch07--437">
      This is a very enlightening consideration: in effect, there may have to be a “second revolution.” During the
      contemplated transitional period, in fact, there is a question mark left hanging over the reality of “proletarian
      rule,” at least in a country like Germany. What gives this transitional period its specific transitional
      character is this: (1) it is based on a bloc of classes—proletariat, small peasantry, and petty-bourgeoisie—under
      the hegemony of the proletariat; (2) it is a transition not from proletarian rule to the realization of
      socialism, but rather it is a transition to definitive proletarian rule itself, out of a revolutionary Democratic
      regime which is more ambiguous in character.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch07--438">
      Hence the answer continues as follows with regard to the transitional period, the name of which is Democracy:
    </div>
<div class="bqi" id="ch07--439">
      Democracy would be quite useless to the proletariat if it were not immediately used as a means of carrying
      through further measures directly attacking private ownership and securing the means of subsistence of the
      proletariat.
    </div>
<div class="noindent" id="ch07--440">
      And a twelve-point program then follows to concretize this.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch07--441">
      In the last paragraph of the answer, we are given to understand that the realization of the program will develop
      not so much in accordance merely with technical possibilities (as would be true of any workers’ state) but in

      come to see that they have to come along in the direction of consistent Communism—or else make the “second fight”
      necessary.

      In the answer to Question 19 we are told that “The communist revolution … will be a revolution taking place
      simultaneously in all civilized countries, that is, at least in England, America, France and Germany.” But its
      further evolution in these different countries is not expected to be uniform. “In each of these countries it will
      develop more quickly or more slowly” depending on the degree of industrialization already attained. “It will
      therefore be slowest and most difficult to carry out in Germany …”<sup class="calibre13" id="ch07--447"><a class="calibre14" id="ch07fn76"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch07fn76-r" id="ch07--449">76</a></sup>

      In the answer to Question 24, which distinguishes different kinds of socialists, we gather that, on the political
      side, the transitional period implies the joint power of the Communists and the tendency of “democratic
      socialists.” This latter tendency—the social-reform wing of the Democracy—“in the same way as the Communists
      desire part of the measures listed in Question [18] not, however, as a means of transition to communism but as
      measures sufficient to abolish the misery of present society and to cause its evils to disappear.” It is these
      allies who will have to be brought along as the revolutionary regime has to make more and more radical inroads on
      private property. They are mixed in class basis: some are “proletarians who are not yet sufficiently enlightened
      regarding the conditions of the emancipation of their class,” and some “are members of the petty-bourgeoisie, a
      class which, until the winning of Democracy and the realization of the socialist measures following upon it, has
      in many respects the same interest as the proletariat.”<sup class="calibre13" id="ch07--453"><a class="calibre14" id="ch07fn77"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch07fn77-r" id="ch07--455">77</a></sup>

      “Until the winning of Democracy”—and afterward? One gathers that the “democratic socialists” will sort themselves

      the uninterrupted continuation of the revolution.

<div class="indent" id="ch07--460">
      In contrast, the final text of the Manifesto by Marx avoided a definite statement on many of the problems we have
      been mooting, or referred to them in an open-ended way. There was more than one reason.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch07--461">
      In the first place, most of the document viewed the problems of social evolution from a great historical height
      where the immediate issues of a country like Germany dwindled from sight. When it said that “the bourgeoisie has
      at last, since the establishment of Modern Industry and of the world market, conquered for itself, in the modern
      representative State, exclusive political sway,”<sup class="calibre13" id="ch07--462"><a class="calibre14" id="ch07fn78"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch07fn78-r" id="ch07--464">78</a></sup> it was making a statement that was then applicable to only two
      European countries at most—and the word <em class="calibre8" id="ch07--465">exclusive</em> was an exaggeration for both of
      them.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch07--466"><a class="calibre14" id="ch07fn79"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch07fn79-r" id="ch07--468">79</a></sup> It was because the Manifesto took the long view that it survives so well. But
      for 1848 it took up “what is to be done” only in the very brief Part IV.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch07--469">
      Secondly, it is sometimes forgotten that the Manifesto was written not as an exposition of Marx’s and Engels’
      personal opinions but as a program to be accepted and signed by an organization.<a class="calibre6" id="ch07en12-r"></a><a class="nounder1" href="43.html#ch07en12" id="ch07--471">*</a> Clear-cut statements on immediate political perspectives
      were bound to be more controversial than a long-term theoretical statement, both inside and outside the Communist
      League. In addition, as we have already suggested, it is possible that Marx at this point may have had less
      decided views on the matter than Engels.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch07--472">
      In any case, it is only on the last page of the Manifesto that the <a class="calibre6" id="page_196"></a>political issue of the
      coming German revolution is taken up at all, though it had already entered obliquely into the discussion of the
      various socialist schools in <a class="nounder1" href="24.html#part03" id="ch07--474">Part III</a>, with two
      extensive attacks on the profeudal socialist tendencies. It is on this last page that we find that in Germany the
      bourgeoisie has conquered no sway at all but “is on the eve of a bourgeois revolution.” The political perspective
      is formulated with an escape clause:
    </div>
<div class="bqi" id="ch07--475">
      In Germany they [the Communists] fight with the bourgeoisie whenever it acts in a revolutionary way, against the
      absolute monarchy, the feudal squirearchy, and the petty-bourgeoisie.
    </div>
<div class="noindentb" id="ch07--476">
      The statement is circumspect (“whenever it acts in a revolutionary way”) and makes no prediction on whether it
      will so act. The stress is on the long view even here, hostility to the bourgeoisie—
    </div>
<div class="alpha-list" id="ch07--477">
      in order that the German workers may straightway use, as so many weapons against the bourgeoisie, the social and
      political conditions that the bourgeoisie must necessarily introduce along with its supremacy, and in order that,
      after the fall of the reactionary [pro-absolutist] classes in Germany, the fight against the bourgeoisie itself
      may immediately begin.
    </div>
<div class="bqi2" id="ch07--478">
      … the bourgeois revolution in Germany will be but the prelude to an immediately following proletarian revolution.
    </div>
<div class="noindentt" id="ch07--479">
      The idea of immediacy is stressed three times. The revolution is to move uninterruptedly from the bourgeois state
      into the proletarian revolution.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch07--480"><a class="calibre14" id="ch07fn83"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch07fn83-r" id="ch07--482">83</a></sup>

      What in Engels’ draft had been a fairly clear view of the course of the revolution, through a transitional period
      marked by the victory of the Democracy, leaves its mark on the Manifesto only in passing references, which are
      suitably noncommittal. The most obvious of these is the formulation that
    </div>
<div class="bq" id="ch07--489">
      the first step in the revolution by the working class, is to raise the proletariat to the position of ruling
      class, to win the battle of democracy [<em class="calibre8" id="ch07--490">die Erkämpfung der Demokratie</em>].<sup class="calibre13" id="ch07--491"><a class="calibre14" id="ch07fn85"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch07fn85-r" id="ch07--493">85</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="noindent" id="ch07--494">
      So goes the standard (Moore-Engels) translation done forty years later. <a class="calibre6" id="page_197"></a>In terms of our
      present discussion, the last phrase—literally, “the winning of Democracy”—means: the attainment of the stage
      marked by the political power of the Democracy.<a class="calibre6" id="ch07en13-r"></a><a class="nounder1" href="43.html#ch07en13" id="ch07--497">*</a> It is, in German as in English, a rather hazy way to put it, which leaves open—probably
      intentionally— whether this winning refers to the victory of the Democratic bloc over the reaction or to the
      victory of the proletariat at the head of the Democracy. Here this victory is flatly equated with establishing
      the proletariat as the ruling class, without any more explanation than this issue receives elsewhere in the
      Manifesto.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch07--498">
      The ten-point program that follows<sup class="calibre13" id="ch07--499"><a class="calibre14" id="ch07fn88"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch07fn88-r" id="ch07--501">88</a></sup> echoes many of the previous versions of the transitional program;
      but—again—it is not presented in that context, nor as a program for a bloc of Communists and other revolutionary
      forces, even though such blocs are envisaged in Part IV.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch07--502">
      Another reticence of the Manifesto concerns its treatment of the class composition of the Democracy: there is no
      treatment. We have seen that, repeatedly and vigorously, articles by Engels had included the petty-bourgeoisie as
      a constituent of the antibourgeois bloc of the Democracy. This was to be a bloc of the proletariat, small
      peasantry, and petty-bourgeoisie: so Engels had explained in his article against Heinzen and in his draft of the
      Manifesto. But this conception nowhere appears in the Manifesto itself.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch07--503">
      On the contrary, where the petty-bourgeoisie is characterized, it is dismissed as reactionary and worse: “In
      Germany the <em class="calibre8" id="ch07--504">petty-bourgeois</em> class, a relic of the sixteenth century … is the real social
      basis of the existing state of things.”<sup class="calibre13" id="ch07--505"><a class="calibre14" id="ch07fn89"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch07fn89-r" id="ch07--507">89</a></sup> This hostile formulation is contained not in the section on
      “Petty-Bourgeois Socialism” but in the following section on “True Socialism.” In fact, this helps to explain what
      is involved. For it is in polemics against “True Socialism” that the harshest indictments of the
      petty-bourgeoisie are found. The main danger seen is the effort to mobilize a petty-bourgeois socialistic
      (reform) movement to support the obsolete ruling classes against the coming bourgeois revolution. This
      apprehension exists even for Engels, at the very same time that he is advocating the Democratic bloc of
      proletariat, small peasantry, and <a class="calibre6" id="page_198"></a>petty-bourgeoisie. In his 1847 unfinished pamphlet, he had
      sought to counter the “True Socialist” faith in the absolutist-bureaucratic status quo with the argument that the
      line of social progress involves the bourgeoisie’s accession to power. In line with this emphasis he argues that
      no other class—not the petty-bourgeoisie, not the peasantry—can play this progressive social role today. “The
      petty-bourgeois,” he writes, “is conservative so long as the ruling class merely gives a few concessions; the
      bourgeois is revolutionary, until he himself rules.”<sup class="calibre13" id="ch07--509"><a class="calibre14" id="ch07fn90"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch07fn90-r" id="ch07--511">90</a></sup> Thus there is a tendency for the petty-bourgeoisie to be
      taken in tow by the feudal elements.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch07--512">
      But Engels makes clear that this pattern of the past is no longer quite valid. His analysis is more up-to-date
      than the flat hostility that Marx wrote into the Manifesto shortly afterward. The petty-bourgeoisie, Engels goes
      on to say, is squeezed between the political power of the nobility and the bureaucratic state, on the one hand,
      and the economic’power of the bourgeoisie, on the other; but more and more even its reactionary sectors see the
      advantages of lining up with the bourgeoisie. Germany, he writes, has just about arrived at the stage where the
      petty-bourgeoisie under pressure “is taking the heroic resolve of abandoning the nobility and throwing itself on
      the bosom of the bourgeoisie,” and is daily coming more and more under the hegemony of that class.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch07--513"><a class="calibre14" id="ch07fn91"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch07fn91-r" id="ch07--515">91</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="indent" id="ch07--516">
      In contrast, the Manifesto seems to leave no room for a positive approach to the petty-bourgeoisie. It even ends
      with a passage that speaks of fighting in Germany “with the bourgeoisie whenever it acts in a revolutionary way”
      against the monarchy, nobility, <em class="calibre8" id="ch07--517">and the petty-bourgeoisie</em>, this class being lumped with
      the counterrevolution.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch07--518"><a class="calibre14" id="ch07fn92"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch07fn92-r" id="ch07--520">92</a></sup> <a class="nounder1" href="7.html#part01" id="ch07--521">Part I</a> too had
      lumped the petty-bourgeoisie with the prebourgeois reaction in a list of classes which the proletariat fights as
      “the enemies of their enemies.”<sup class="calibre13" id="ch07--522"><a class="calibre14" id="ch07fn93"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch07fn93-r" id="ch07--524">93</a></sup> Thus, whereas Engels had been listing the petty-bourgeoisie as part of the
      Democratic alliance for revolution, the Manifesto listed it on the other side of the barricades, as nothing more
      than an ally of the absolutist-feudal reaction. What this reflects is the fact that at this point Marx saw
      petty-bourgeois Feudal Socialism and True Socialism looming very large as a dangerous obstacle to the revolution.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch07--525">
      But this totally negative approach to the petty-bourgeoisie, which is a peculiarity of the Manifesto, did not
      last beyond it. A month after it had come off the press, and with the revolution already breaking out, the two
      authors put out a flysheet containing the “Demands of the <a class="calibre6" id="page_199"></a>Communist Party [Tendency] in
      Germany,” which—for the first time in an official way—came out foursquare in favor of the Democratic bloc of
      proletariat, small peasantry, and petty-bourgeoisie exactly as <em class="calibre8" id="ch07--527">Engels</em> had been writing
      about it.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch07--528">
      For the sake of convenience, let us anticipate the next chapter by looking at some leading features of this brief
      document, which was issued as a supplement to the Manifesto and used as such.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch07--529">
      While the Manifesto was laconic and noncommittal on the immediate political program in the leading countries,
      this subject required concrete attention as soon as the revolution broke out. When Berlin erupted on March 18,
      Marx, Engels, and a Communist League group were in Paris, and drew up the flysheet of demands in preparation for
      activity in Germany. These seventeen demands constituted an adaptation of the ten-point program suggested in the
      Manifesto as the first steps of proletarian rule. Besides the fact that proletarian rule was not yet here, that
      ten-point list had been abstractly drafted for disparate countries, and before the onset of a directly
      revolutionary situation. The new list of seventeen “Demands” is specifically directed to Germany, and is tailored
      to the uncertain circumstances that obtained at the end of March.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch07--530">
      The flysheet contained no general political discussion or perspective, for the members of the League were
      supposed to use it in conjunction with the Manifesto itself,<sup class="calibre13" id="ch07--531"><a class="calibre14" id="ch07fn94"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch07fn94-r" id="ch07--533">94</a></sup> which thereby provided its political context.
      Directed to Germany, the new demands were formulated to be less thoroughgoing than the Manifesto’s ten points,
      which had had England and France very prominently in mind. For example, inheritance is to be limited, not
      abolished. Although a number of inroads into bourgeois economic power were still proposed in the Demands,
      including a number of nationalizations, the greater thrust was against the royal power and the landowners; and in
      explanation of the demand (no. 10) fqr a state bank to replace all private banks, it is even written that “this
      measure is necessary in order to bind the interests of the conservative bourgeoisie to the cause of the
      revolution.”<a class="calibre6" id="ch07en14-r"></a><a class="nounder1" href="43.html#ch07en14" id="ch07--535">*</a> This is the
      clearest indication of continued willingness to “fight with the bourgeoisie whenever it acts in a revolutionary
      way.”<sup class="calibre13" id="ch07--536"><a class="calibre14" id="ch07fn96"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch07fn96-r" id="ch07--538">96</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="indent" id="ch07--539">
<a class="calibre6" id="page_200"></a>Finally, the Demands definitely dropped the Manifesto’s view of the petty-bourgeoisie as
      counterrevolutionary; rather, it includes this class in the united front of potentially revolutionary forces: “It
      is to the interest of the German proletariat, the petty-bourgeoisie and the small peasantry to support these
      demands with all possible energy.”<sup class="calibre13" id="ch07--541"><a class="calibre14" id="ch07fn97"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch07fn97-r" id="ch07--543">97</a></sup> This united front pointedly excludes the bourgeoisie itself. In other
      words, on this issue it turned out that the view embodied in the Manifesto was a temporary aberration. From this
      time on, it was the conception developed by Engels that became the joint view of the partnership.
    </div>
<div class="toc-part" id="ch07--544">

<div class="indent" id="ch07--545">
      While it is true that the Manifesto was not written as a guide to immediate political problems in a particular
      country, its lacunae and unclarities in this field suggest how moot many of these problems were on the eve of the
      revolution. In any case, the revolution came on the heels of the Manifesto’s publication, and all bets were off.
      Fifteen years later, Marx would remark in a letter to his friend: “the easy-going delusions and the almost
      childish enthusiasm with which, before February 1848, we greeted the era of revolution have gone to the
      devil.”<sup class="calibre13" id="ch07--546"><a class="calibre14" id="ch07fn98"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch07fn98-r" id="ch07--548">98</a></sup> Certainly, it was during the thirteen months of their participation in the
      revolution in Germany itself, and then during the following years of reflection on the events, that Marx and
      Engels worked out their more mature views on the questions which, before 1848, could be raised but not
      successfully answered.

<div class="indent" id="ch07--549">
      These questions above all concerned the relationship between the bourgeois revolution of the day (the revolution
