<div class="indent" id="ch16--3">
      There is a considerable marxological literature devoted to the subject of Marx’s views on “intellectuals,” for
      the <em class="calibre8" id="ch16--4">soi-disant</em> intellectuals are endlessly fascinated by the subject. But Marx did not
      address himself to the question, which did not become a prominent preoccupation until after his time; and it is
      difficult to say what an intellectual is—there are scores of definitions and two rarely agree. It is more
      fruitful to begin with something more definite.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch16--5">
      Most discussions about intellectuals actually operate by pointing a finger rather than defining. They may point
      to certain occupations (like writers or professors), or to certain occupational groups (like professionals or
      white-collar workers), or to certain sociopsychological categories (like scholars or “thinkers”). These elements
      are all found in the general area dominated by brain work or intellectual (mental) labor as distinguished more or
      less clearly from manual and physical labor.
    </div>
<h3 class="h2" id="ch16lev1">1. MARX’S AREA OF CONCERN</h3>
<div class="indent" id="ch16--7">
      We begin by examining Marx’s views on the role of elements typical of this general area, without being concerned
      with whether we are really discussing “intellectuals,” whatever they are. The way in which Marx posed the
      question to himself was more concrete: it concerned the role of <em class="calibre8" id="ch16--8">educated people</em> (the
      so-called “educated classes”) and of education as a class attribute.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch16--9">
      Marx naturally recognized that the proletarian movement needs people with a variety of advanced skills,
      abilities, talents, training, and knowledge. In many or most cases these attributes are furthered by a <a class="calibre6" id="page_482"></a>more or less high degree of education. Moreover, some occupations which socialists want to affect,
      or which they need for the new social order, depend heavily on a high level of formal training: scientists and
      technologists, professionals of many sorts, teachers on several levels, academics in general, students in
      particular, writers and artists, and others who are primarily engaged in the production and dissemination of
      ideas.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch16--11">
      Especially in Marx’s time, this type of ability was usually to be sought among the so-called “educated
      classes”—which meant the social strata that could afford long schooling for their scions.<a class="calibre6" id="ch16en1-r"></a><a class="nounder1" href="43.html#ch16en1" id="ch16--13">*</a> The working classes tend to suffer
      from relatively poor access to formal education, both because of deliberate discrimination and because of biases
      built into the system (for example, workers’ families cannot so easily afford long abstinence from paid work even
      if education is free). Hence the above-listed occupations, especially because of the educational prerequisites,
      tended to be filled by the progeny of the upper classes, from the more affluent reaches of the petty-bourgeoisie
      through the bourgeoisie on to the aristocracy or its remnants.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch16--14">
      The consequence was a serious disadvantage for the proletarian movement for many practical purposes. The class
      background of the proletariat prepared it well for many movement needs—organizational efficiency and militancy,
      for instance—but poorly for the struggle in the arena of national opinion using the available instruments of
      publicism.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch16--15">
      Therefore the acquirement of educated recruits took on a special importance. But these tended to be bourgeois
      elements, however sympathetic to the working class. A potentiality was created; an extra class tension was
      introduced into the proletarian movement, reflecting class antagonisms outside the movement. This was the nature
      of the problem. This problem concerns <em class="calibre8" id="ch16--16">educated</em> recruits, not necessarily people called
      intellectuals. Unless, of course, an intellectual is defined as an educated person, as has been done; but this
      empties the word of any special meaning.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch16--17">
      The focus of Marx’s interest, then, was not on the disjunction Intellectuals versus Workers—whatever that may be
      defined to mean. <a class="calibre6" id="page_483"></a>That view of the problem was invented later by intellectuals. Marx’s
      concern was directed to the class background, hence the class-biased training and predispositions, of the
      educated elements who could be useful to the proletarian movement if they could be assimilated. This is the main
      subject of the next three chapters.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch16--19">
      In this chapter we consider Marx’s views on the role of intellectual (mental) labor in general. There is going to
      be a constant problem with the ambiguity of the English word <em class="calibre8" id="ch16--20">intellectual</em>, which leads to
      ambiguous English translations from the German. For example, <em class="calibre8" id="ch16--21">geistige Arbeit</em> means
      intellectual or mental labor or “brain work” as distinct from manual or physical labor; but it does not mean the
      work specifically performed by an “intellectual” (which as a noun in English acquires a specially portentous
      meaning). <em class="calibre8" id="ch16--22">Geistig</em> has a scope not easily duplicated by any single English word: mental,
      spiritual, moral, intellectual, psychological, all in the sense of pertaining to the mind rather than the body.
      (But in English one no longer says <em class="calibre8" id="ch16--23">spiritual labor</em> when one means intellectual or mental
      labor, as is done in the extant translation of Marx’s <em class="calibre8" id="ch16--24">Theories of Surplus Value</em>.)<sup class="calibre13" id="ch16--25"><a class="calibre14" id="ch16fn3"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch16fn3-r" id="ch16--27">3</a></sup> When <em class="calibre8" id="ch16--28">intellectual</em> becomes a noun, the German equivalent is not a derivative of <em class="calibre8" id="ch16--29">Geist</em> but rather <em class="calibre8" id="ch16--30">Intellektuelle</em>, <em class="calibre8" id="ch16--31">Intelligenz</em>. In
      the following pages, <em class="calibre8" id="ch16--32">intellectual</em> as an adjective (as in <em class="calibre8" id="ch16--33">intellectual
      labor</em>) never means <em class="calibre8" id="ch16--34">pertaining to intellectuals;</em> it is used much as Marx uses the
      German <em class="calibre8" id="ch16--35">geistig</em>.
    </div>
<h3 class="h2" id="ch16lev2">2. INTEGRAL HUMAN LABOR</h3>
<div class="indent" id="ch16--37">
      The distinction between intellectual and physical labor, between the labor of head and hand, is a real one, even
      if not absolute. It is their <em class="calibre8" id="ch16--38">separation</em> which, to Marx, is a distortion of humanity. The
      labor of the whole person involves both.
    </div>
<div class="indentb" id="ch16--39">
      Marx takes this as a fundamental proposition in <em class="calibre8" id="ch16--40">Capital</em>. In fact, he defines human labor,
      as distinct from the sometimes similar labor of animals, on the basis of this criterion. What marks labor as
      human is its intellectual (mental) component. “We presuppose labor in a form that stamps it as exclusively
      human,” he writes. It is true that a spider does weaving and a bee does the work of an architect—
    </div>
<div class="bq" id="ch16--41">
      But what distinguishes the worst architect from the best of bees is this, that the architect raises his structure
      in imagination before <a class="calibre6" id="page_484"></a>he erects it in reality. At the end of every labor-process, we get a
      result that already existed in the imagination of the laborer at its commencement, hence already existed in
      idea-form [<em class="calibre8" id="ch16--43">ideel</em>].<a class="calibre6" id="ch16en2-r"></a><a class="nounder1" href="43.html#ch16en2" id="ch16--45">*</a> He not only effects a change of form in the material on which he works, but he also
      realizes a purpose of his own that gives the law to his modus operandi, and to which he must subordinate his
      will.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch16--46"><a class="calibre14" id="ch16fn4"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch16fn4-r" id="ch16--48">4</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="noindentt" id="ch16--49">
      The alteration of the material in the labor process was “designed from the commencement,” he adds. The material
      is adapted to “the wants of man.”<sup class="calibre13" id="ch16--50"><a class="calibre14" id="ch16fn5"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch16fn5-r" id="ch16--52">5</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="indent" id="ch16--53">
      In his essay on “The Part Played by Labor in the Transition from Ape to Man,” Engels later emphasized the
      evolutionary task performed by labor, but it must be added: by <em class="calibre8" id="ch16--54">human</em> labor. While
      stressing the decisive role of the hand, he writes: “Thus the hand is not only the organ of labor, <em class="calibre8" id="ch16--55">it is also the product of labor</em>.” The mental component of labor was itself an attribute of a
      physical advance, the human brain. Engels writes that only through a long and complex evolution in which physical
      change (of the hand, for instance) interacted with mental-physical change in the brain and senses—only through
      this process of change “has the human hand attained the high degree of perfection that has enabled it to conjure
      into being the pictures of Raphael, the statues of Thorwaldsen, the music of Paganini.”<sup class="calibre13" id="ch16--56"><a class="calibre14" id="ch16fn6"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch16fn6-r" id="ch16--58">6</a></sup> Just as, for Marx, the labor
      process is not merely an exertion of muscle, so also the process of artistic creation is not merely an activity
      of little gray cells. The whole person is involved in both cases; and to the extent that this is not true, the
      person is being crippled.
    </div>
<div class="indentb" id="ch16--59">
      The combination of intellectual and physical labor is natural when one is working purely individually; but the
      combination of laborers permits separation:
    </div>
<div class="bqi" id="ch16--60">
      So far as the labor-process is purely individual, one and the same laborer unites in himself all the functions
      that later on become separated. … As in the natural body head and hand wait upon each other, so the labor-process
      unites the labor of the hand with that of the head. Later on they part company and even become deadly foes. The
      product ceases to be the direct product of the individual, and becomes a social product, produced in common by a
      collective laborer, i.e., by a combination of workmen …<sup class="calibre13" id="ch16--61"><a class="calibre14" id="ch16fn7"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch16fn7-r" id="ch16--63">7</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="indentt" id="ch16--64">
<a class="calibre6" id="page_485"></a>Such separation reaches a high point in capitalism, and its most extreme forms are
      characteristic of capitalism. Physical and intellectual labor remain associated in the labor process only in the
      “collective laborer,” the aggregate of workers producing a particular commodity; but for the individual worker,
      intellectual labor is increasingly divorced from physical.
    </div>
<div class="indentb" id="ch16--66">
      This separation has nothing to do with the distinction between laborers who are directly engaged in working on
      material and those who are not. For instance (following an example given by Marx), janitors or floor-sweepers
      have nothing directly to do with working up the raw material, yet are just as much a part of the “living
      production machine” (the collective laborer) as are the others. So too “the works engineer has yet another
      relation and in the main works only with his brain, and so on,” but is also a part of the collective
      laborer.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch16--67"><a class="calibre14" id="ch16fn8"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch16fn8-r" id="ch16--69">8</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="bq" id="ch16--70">
      It is indeed the characteristic feature of the capitalist mode of production that it separates the various kinds
      of labor from each other, therefore also mental and manual labor—or kinds of labor in which one or the other
      predominates—and distributes them among different people. This however does not prevent the material product from
      being the <em class="calibre8" id="ch16--71">common product</em> of these persons …<sup class="calibre13" id="ch16--72"><a class="calibre14" id="ch16fn9"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch16fn9-r" id="ch16--74">9</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="noindentt" id="ch16--75">
      Brain workers or manual workers, touching the material or not, they are all producing the commodity, in the same
      economic relation to it and to the capitalist; they are all producing surplus-value and hence producing capital
      (their embodied labor); they are all parts of the collective laborer, all proletarians—intellectual and manual
      laborers alike.
    </div>
<div class="indentb" id="ch16--76">
      In short, included in the labor that goes to enhance the value of a commodity are
    </div>
<div class="bq" id="ch16--77">
      all intellectual labors which are directly consumed in material production. Not only the laborer working directly
      with his hands or a machine, but overlooker, engineer, manager, clerk, etc.—in a word, the labor of the whole
      personnel required in a particular sphere of material production to produce a particular commodity, whose joint
      labor (cooperation) is required for commodity production.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch16--78"><a class="calibre14" id="ch16fn10"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch16fn10-r" id="ch16--80">10</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="noindentt" id="ch16--81">

      operating an elevator to opera-singing for a profit-making enterprise.

<h3 class="h2" id="ch16lev3"><a class="calibre15" id="page_486"></a>3. CAPITALISM AND INTELLECTUALS</h3>
<div class="indent" id="ch16--84">
      Intellectual labor, or brain work, is, then, a necessary and integral part of the process of production, as much
      an attribute of the “collective laborer” as manual labor is. But in popular parlance, including that of many
      sociologists, intellectual activity is often viewed as something typically outside of the process of
      production—something external to the workaday world (for example, the work of sociologists in discussing the
      definition of intellectual). More generally, it is often considered something distinctive when it is detached not
      only from manual labor but from any practice.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch16--85">
      From Marx’s standpoint the important line of demarcation runs not between manual and intellectual labor but
      through two other pairs. There is an important line between work in the process of production and work outside of
      production; there is another between socially useful and necessary work as against work that is socially useless
      or harmful. It is class society that separates out the category of intellectual labor so sharply and that gives a
      special honorific weight to intellectual activity detached from practice. This is one aspect of the tendency of
      class society to intensify the division of labor in socially deleterious forms.
    </div>
<div class="indentb" id="ch16--86">
      Marx wrote in <em class="calibre8" id="ch16--87">The German Ideology</em>, expounding his new thesis that the ruling ideas are the
      ideas of the ruling class:
    </div>
<div class="bq" id="ch16--88">
      The division of labor, which we already saw above … as one of the chief forces of history up to now, manifests
      itself also in the ruling class as the division of mental and material labor, so that inside this class one part
      appears as the thinkers of this class (its active, conceptive ideologues, who make their main livelihood out of
      cultivating the class’s illusion about itself) while the others’ relation to these ideas and illusions is more
      one of passive receptivity, since they are the active members of this class in reality and have less time to make
      up illusions and ideas about themselves. Within this class, this cleavage can even develop into a certain
      opposition and hostility between the two parts, but given any practical collision endangering the class itself,
      this passes away of itself, whereupon there also vanishes the appearance that the ruling ideas were not the ideas
      of the ruling class and had a power distinct from the power of this class.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch16--89"><a class="calibre14" id="ch16fn11"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch16fn11-r" id="ch16--91">11</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="noindentt" id="ch16--92">
      It is widely recognized that the intellectual as a social type seems to <a class="calibre6" id="page_487"></a>come into historical
      prominence with the beginnings of the bourgeois era. Yet previous classes had their ideologues and thinkers, who
      made “their main livelihood out of cultivating the class’s illusion about itself” or imposing this set of
      illusions on all of society. Thus, in the Middle Ages the intellectual specialists of the ruling class were
      usually provided by the Church; and from early on, religion, the intellectualization of people’s relation to
      nature, also provided the ideologies and ideologists for handling illusions about the relation of person to
      person. “The first form of ideologists, <em class="calibre8" id="ch16--94">priests</em>,” Marx noted, were coincident with the
      appearance of a division between material and intellectual labor. And “the <em class="calibre8" id="ch16--95">division of
      labor</em> implies the possibility, nay the fact, that intellectual and material activity, that enjoyment and
      labor, production and consumption, devolve on different individuals …”<sup class="calibre13" id="ch16--96"><a class="calibre14" id="ch16fn11a"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch16fn11a-r" id="ch16--98">11a</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="indent" id="ch16--99">
      What, then, makes this kind of intellectual specialist a prominent outgrowth of the bourgeois era? What must have
      changed was the division of labor between the establishment’s thinkers and doers, a division so visibly deepened
      in modern times that a new label was required for a newly important social element. In the Middle Ages the
      Church, main source of intellectual operatives, was itself the biggest landowner and lord in the ongoing system.
      The case is different with capitalism in this respect as in others. The same reasons that produce the political
      inaptitude of the capitalist class<sup class="calibre13" id="ch16--100"><a class="calibre14" id="ch16fn12"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch16fn12-r" id="ch16--102">12</a></sup> also make it less likely than other ruling classes to provide its own
      intellectual rationalizers from its own ranks: capitalists <em class="calibre8" id="ch16--103">qua</em> capitalists are interested
      in profits, not philosophy, and in cotton-spinning as against theory-spinning. It leaves far more room than ever
      before for the assignment of ancillary duties to professional specialists: in the one case, professional
      politicians; in the other, professional ideology-fabricators.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch16--104"><a class="calibre14" id="ch16fn13"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch16fn13-r" id="ch16--106">13</a></sup> Thus, on the highest level of the system it
      introduces a division of labor between those who stuff moneybags and those who stuff heads. This appears as the
      difference between doing and thinking.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch16--107">
      Consequently, the rise of a newly prominent social stratum produces <em class="calibre8" id="ch16--108">intellectual</em> as a
      noun. As an adjective, <em class="calibre8" id="ch16--109">intellectual</em> has naturally pointed in different directions
      depending on what it is counterposed to. If counterposed to <em class="calibre8" id="ch16--110">physical</em>, it means pertaining
      to the mind; if counterposed to <em class="calibre8" id="ch16--111">emotional</em> (as in a “purely intellectual response to
      music”), it emphasizes reason or logic (and by extension may also be counterposed to <em class="calibre8" id="ch16--112">moral</em>). But it is also commonly counterposed to <em class="calibre8" id="ch16--113">practical:</em> for example,
      a “merely intellectual revolutionary” is charged with failing to <a class="calibre6" id="page_488"></a>put ideas into practice or
      action, with divorcing thinking from doing. It is this usage that generally gives rise to the noun <em class="calibre8" id="ch16--115">intellectual</em>, as actually used by most people, other than intellectuals trying to fabricate an
      acceptable definition. The label <em class="calibre8" id="ch16--116">an intellectual</em> tends to connote the onesidedness of a
      specialist in the manipulation of ideas and abstract rationalization divorced from the responsibility of
      performance. Counterposing “Men of Ideas” (the title of a well-known sociological work on the subject) to “men of
      action,” it is the obverse of the Practical Man or Woman who scorns ideas and dismisses theory. Which explains
      why intellectualism and anti-intellectualism are Siamese twins.
    </div>
<div class="indentb" id="ch16--117">
      The growth of a stratum of intellectuals is connected with the deepening of class differentiations in society.
      Marx quotes Necker on the “contrast between wealth that does not labor and poverty that labors in order to live,”
      and then comments that this contrast
    </div>
<div class="bq" id="ch16--118">
      also gives rise to a contrast of knowledge. Knowledge and labor become separated. The former confronts the latter
      as capital, or as a luxury article for the rich.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch16--119"><a class="calibre14" id="ch16fn14"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch16fn14-r" id="ch16--121">14</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="noindenttb" id="ch16--122">
      Marx then quotes an interesting passage from Necker which ends as follows: “is it not certain that this
      inequality of knowledge has become necessary for the maintenance of all the social inequalities <em class="calibre8" id="ch16--123">which gave rise to it?”</em> Certainly Marx did not conceive of the analysis of capitalist production
      as the province only of something narrowly called economics:
    </div>
<div class="bqi" id="ch16--124">
      Man himself is the basis of his material production, as of any other production that he carries on. All
      circumstances, therefore, which affect man, the <em class="calibre8" id="ch16--125">subject</em> of production, more or less
      modify all his functions and activities, and therefore too his functions and activities as the creator of
      material wealth, of commodities. In this respect it can in fact be shown that <em class="calibre8" id="ch16--126">all</em> human
      relations and functions, however and in whatever form they may appear, influence material production and have a
      more or less decisive influence on it.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch16--127"><a class="calibre14" id="ch16fn15"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch16fn15-r" id="ch16--129">15</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="indentt" id="ch16--130">
      The widened split between intellectual and physical labor has far-reaching cultural as well as socioeconomic
      effects, and so presents a basic challenge to the socialist reorganization of society. From this viewpoint it
      will be taken up again in Volume 3 of this work. Suffice to say now that, for Marx, this disjunction is an
      offense to the humanness of labor and destructive of the wholeness of the human being, and must therefore be
      overcome. Confinement to purely intellectual labor—intellectual <a class="calibre6" id="page_489"></a>labor detached from
      practice—means a distorting onesidedness in the conditions of life as well as of labor. Insofar as the
      intellectual emerges as a distinctive social type, this is a pathological symptom. Just as modern class society
      called it into being on such a scale, Marx points in the direction of abolishing it. We will see that the
      abolition—more accurately, the transcendence—of the intellectuals as a pathological social element is one of the
      goals of the good society, along with the elimination of criminals, racists, feeble-minded, and other
      undesirables.

<div class="indent" id="ch16--132">
      However, nothing in these pages depends on a special definition of the noun form of <em class="calibre8" id="ch16--133">intellectual</em>. Where it is used, especially in the next two chapters with reference to the
      problems of the socialist movement in Marx’s time, it refers in a general way to educated recruits of bourgeois
      background who aspire to specialize in the manipulation of ideas, or conceive this to be their special
      contribution.

      Marx’s discussion of the forms and role of intellectual labor is largely found under the head of his analyses of
      productive and unproductive labor. Of course, there is no question of a separate economics of intellectual labor
      in any sense; we are mainly concerned with removing misconceptions about the relationship of some types of
      nonmanual labor to the productive process. Let us first summarize Marx’s basic views on the subject.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch16--136">
      1. What is a “productive laborer”? Not simply one who produces something. We are talking about productive
      laborers <em class="calibre8" id="ch16--137">under capitalism</em> and from the standpoint of the capitalist system, not from the
      standpoint of justice, humanity, abstract society, or some other social order.
    </div>
<div class="indentb" id="ch16--138">
      2. In terms of capitalism, only those laborers are productive who produce capital, by producing surplus-value.
    </div>
<div class="bq" id="ch16--139">
      Capitalist production is not merely the production of commodities, it is essentially the production of
      surplus-value…. That laborer alone is productive who produces surplus-value for the capitalist, and thus works
      for the self-expansion of capital.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch16--140"><a class="calibre14" id="ch16fn16"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch16fn16-r" id="ch16--142">16</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="noindentt" id="ch16--143">
      Working out the proposition in his notebook, Marx enlarged on the <a class="calibre6" id="page_490"></a>statement that “<em class="calibre8" id="ch16--145">Productive labor</em> is simply labor that produces <em class="calibre8" id="ch16--146">capital</em>.” The piano maker
      is a productive worker, but not the piano player, even though the latter does produce something, namely music;
      but this playing “is not for this reason <em class="calibre8" id="ch16--147">productive labor</em> in the <em class="calibre8" id="ch16--148">economic sense;</em> no more than the labor of a fool who produces phantasmagoria.” Labor that does
      not produce capital may be useful or harmful: no matter; it is unproductive labor in either case (in the
      aforesaid economic sense).<sup class="calibre13" id="ch16--149"><a class="calibre14" id="ch16fn17"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch16fn17-r" id="ch16--151">17</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="indent" id="ch16--152">
      Spelled out more formally: productive labor is wage-labor which produces a vendible commodity whose sale can
      replace the value of the labor embodied in it, thereby producing a surplus-value and hence new capital.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch16--153"><a class="calibre14" id="ch16fn18"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch16fn18-r" id="ch16--155">18</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="indent" id="ch16--156">
      3. The label <em class="calibre8" id="ch16--157">productive laborer</em>, rather than unproductive, is not in the least honorific,
      under capitalism. One can produce goods or services of the greatest importance to humanity, and even necessary
      for capitalism itself, without being “productive”; and contrariwise one can produce commodities that are socially
      worthless or harmful and still be productive, since these attributes are irrelevant to capitalism’s view of the
      matter.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch16--158"><a class="calibre14" id="ch16fn19"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch16fn19-r" id="ch16--160">19</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="indentb" id="ch16--161">
      Thus Marx takes up the argument of the economist Storch that professors and writers are necessarily productive
      because they produce enlightenment. Marx retorts that they may also produce obscurantism. Poets and painters may
      “produce” good taste, but also bad taste; physicians may be said to “produce” health, but also illness. Besides:
    </div>
<div class="bq" id="ch16--162">
      it can just as well be said that illness produces physicians, stupidity produces professors and writers, lack of
      taste poets and painters, immorality moralists, superstition preachers, and general insecurity produces the
      sovereign.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch16--163"><a class="calibre14" id="ch16fn20"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch16fn20-r" id="ch16--165">20</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="noindentt" id="ch16--166">
      All of these activities or services “produce a real or imagined use-value,” but they do not produce commodities.
      Indeed, some of these activities may be quite necessary for capitalism, still without being commodities, hence
      not productive. A capitalist’s cook performs labor that has a use-value for the capitalist, without producing any
      commodity with exchange-value.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch16--167"><a class="calibre14" id="ch16fn21"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch16fn21-r" id="ch16--169">21</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="indentb" id="ch16--170">
      Marx illustrates further with many examples of intellectual labor, productive and unproductive.
    </div>
<div class="bq" id="ch16--171">
      If we may take an example from outside the sphere of production of material objects, a schoolmaster is a
      productive laborer when, in addition to belaboring the heads of his scholars, he works like a <a class="calibre6" id="page_491"></a>horse to enrich the school proprietor. That the latter had laid out his capital in a teaching
      factory, instead of in a sausage factory, does not alter the relation. … to be a productive laborer is,
      therefore, not a piece of luck but a misfortune.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch16--173"><a class="calibre14" id="ch16fn22"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch16fn22-r" id="ch16--175">22</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="noindentt" id="ch16--176">
      Note that this schoolmaster labors for a private school, not for a government board of education. At this point
      in <em class="calibre8" id="ch16--177">Capital</em>, Marx says he will explain further in “Book IV,” which we know as his <em class="calibre8" id="ch16--178">Theories of Surplus Value;</em> hence the absence of further discussion in this area in <em class="calibre8" id="ch16--179">Capital</em>. He had already given similar examples in his notebook. “Actors are productive workers
      not insofar as they produce a play but [insofar as they] increase their employer’s wealth.”<sup class="calibre13" id="ch16--180"><a class="calibre14" id="ch16fn23"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch16fn23-r" id="ch16--182">23</a></sup> (Again
      a privately owned theater company is assumed.) He scouts the confused ideas of political economists who assume
      that “a thief is also a productive worker, in that he indirectly produces books on criminal law,” and so on. On
      the other hand, workers on meretricious luxury goods “are indeed productive °as far as they increase the capital
      of their master; unproductive as to the material result of their labour.° In fact this ‘productive’ worker is
      just as little interested in the crap he has to make as the capitalist himself who employs him …”<sup class="calibre13" id="ch16--183"><a class="calibre14" id="ch16fn24"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch16fn24-r" id="ch16--185">24</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="indent" id="ch16--186">
      The promised explication in <em class="calibre8" id="ch16--187">Theories of Surplus Value</em> is quite voluminous. While the
      content repeats what we have already explained, the examples of intellectual labor that are given are especially
      useful.
    </div>
<div class="indentb" id="ch16--188">
      A music performer is not <em class="calibre8" id="ch16--189">per se</em> a productive laborer, even though it is argued that the
      musician produces fine memories; just as (Marx adds) drinking champagne may produce a hangover without being
      economically productive. But there is nothing derogatory to music in this:
    </div>
<div class="bq" id="ch16--190">
      If the music is good and if the listener understands music, the consumption of music is more sublime than the
      consumption of champagne, although the production of the latter is a “productive labor” and the production of the
      former is not.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch16--191"><a class="calibre14" id="ch16fn25"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch16fn25-r" id="ch16--193">25</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="noindenttb" id="ch16--194">
      But an artist may also be a productive laborer, depending on the economic relationship: “A writer is a productive
      laborer not insofar as he produces ideas, but insofar as he enriches the publisher who publishes his works, or if
      he is a wage-laborer for a capitalist.”<sup class="calibre13" id="ch16--195"><a class="calibre14" id="ch16fn26"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch16fn26-r" id="ch16--197">26</a></sup>

<div class="bq" id="ch16--198">
<em class="calibre8" id="ch16--199">The same</em> kind of labor may be <em class="calibre8" id="ch16--200">productive</em> or <em class="calibre8" id="ch16--201">unproductive</em>. For example Milton, who wrote <em class="calibre8" id="ch16--202">Paradise Lost</em> for five
      pounds, was an <em class="calibre8" id="ch16--203">unproductive laborer</em>. On the other hand, the writer who turns out stuff
      for his publisher in factory style is a <em class="calibre8" id="ch16--204">productive laborer</em>.
    </div>
<div class="bq" id="ch16--205">
<a class="calibre6" id="page_492"></a>Milton produced <em class="calibre8" id="ch16--207">Paradise Lost</em> for the same reason that a silkworm
      produces silk. It was an activity of <em class="calibre8" id="ch16--208">his nature</em>. Later he sold the product for £5. But
      the literary proletarian of Leipzig who fabricates books (for example, Compendia of Economics) under the
      direction of his publisher is a <em class="calibre8" id="ch16--209">productive laborer</em>; for his product is from the outset
      subsumed under capital, and comes into being only for the purpose of increasing that capital. A singer who sells
      her song for her own account is an <em class="calibre8" id="ch16--210">unproductive laborer</em>. But the same singer commissioned
      by an entrepreneur to sing in order to make money for him is a <em class="calibre8" id="ch16--211">productive laborer;</em> for
      she produces capital.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch16--212"><a class="calibre14" id="ch16fn27"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch16fn27-r" id="ch16--214">27</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="indenttb" id="ch16--215">
      Economically there is a distinction between two types of nonmaterial production. One generates the kind of
      vendible commodity that exists independently of the producer, such as books and paintings. These being
      commodities, what about the labor put in by the writer or painter? Here Marx refines his example of the
      encyclopedia hack.<a class="calibre6" id="ch16en3-r"></a><a class="nounder1" href="43.html#ch16en3" id="ch16--217">*</a>
</div>
<div class="bq" id="ch16--218">
      Here capitalist production is applicable only to a very restricted extent: as for example when a writer of a
      joint work—say an encyclopedia—exploits a number of others as hacks. In this sphere for the most part a <em class="calibre8" id="ch16--219">transitional form to capitalist production</em> remains in existence, in which the various scientific
      or artistic producers, handicraftsmen or experts work for the collective trading capital of the book-trade—a
      relation that has nothing to do with the capitalist mode of production proper and even formally has not yet been
      brought under its sway. The fact that the exploitation of labor is at its highest precisely in these transitional
      forms in no way alters the case.
    </div>
<div class="noindenttb" id="ch16--220">
      Then there is the other type of nonmaterial production, where—
    </div>
<div class="bqi" id="ch16--221">
      2. The production cannot be separated from the act of producing, as is the case with all performing artists,
      orators, actors, teachers, physicians, priests, etc. Here too the capitalist mode of production is met with only
      to a small extent, and from the nature of the case can only be applied in a few spheres. For example, teachers in
      educational establishments may be mere wage-laborers for the entrepreneur of the establishment; many such
      educational factories exist in England. Although in relation <a class="calibre6" id="page_493"></a>to the pupils these teachers
      are not <em class="calibre8" id="ch16--223">productive laborers</em>, they are productive laborers in relation to their employer.
      He exchanges his capital for their labor-power, and enriches himself through this process. It is the same with
      enterprises such as theaters, places of entertainment, etc. In such cases the actor’s relation to the public is
      that of an artist, but in relation to his employer he is a <em class="calibre8" id="ch16--224">productive laborer</em>. All these
      manifestations of capitalist production in this sphere are so insignificant compared with the totality of
      production that they can be left entirely out of account.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch16--225"><a class="calibre14" id="ch16fn29"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch16fn29-r" id="ch16--227">29</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="indentt" id="ch16--228">
      These types of intellectual labor are indeed “insignificant” in effect on the total economy, but of course not
      insignificant from the standpoint of the status of arts, letters, science and other intellectual pursuits within
      capitalist society. How is this intellectual sphere affected by its <em class="calibre8" id="ch16--229">economic</em> relations,
      as distinct from other (social and political) channels by which the ruling social powers subordinate the
      intellectual world to their own interests?
    </div>
<h3 class="h2" id="ch16lev5">5. BOURGEOIS ATTITUDES AND REWARDS</h3>
<div class="indentb" id="ch16--231">
      Ever since Adam Smith made the economic distinction between productive and unproductive laborers—a distinction
      that Marx merely refined—bourgeois thought has taken offense at the implications. If <em class="calibre8" id="ch16--232">productive laborer</em> is not an honorific term within the framework of capitalism but a badge of
      misfortune, this reflects something damaging about capitalism. The English economist Senior resented the idea
      that Moses would have to be classed as an unproductive laborer, and Marx took the occasion to discredit
      unhistorical economics:
    </div>
<div class="bq" id="ch16--233">
      These people are so dominated by their fixed bourgeois ideas that they would think they were insulting Aristotle
      or Julius Caesar if they called them “unproductive laborers.” Aristotle and Caesar would have regarded even the
      title “laborers” as an insult.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch16--234"><a class="calibre14" id="ch16fn30"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch16fn30-r" id="ch16--236">30</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="noindenttb" id="ch16--237">
      Marx explained the source of the resentment:
    </div>
<div class="bqi" id="ch16--238">
      The great mass of so-called “higher grade” workers—such as state officials, military people, artists, doctors,
      priests, judges, lawyers, etc.—some of whom are not only not productive but in <a class="calibre6" id="page_494"></a>essence
      destructive, but who know how to appropriate to themselves a very great part of the “material” wealth partly
      through the sale of their “immaterial” commodities and partly by forcibly imposing the latter on other
      people—found it not at all pleasant to be relegated <em class="calibre8" id="ch16--240">economically</em> to the same class as
      clowns and menial servants and to appear merely as people partaking in the consumption, parasites on the actual
      producers (or rather agents of production). This was a peculiar profanation precisely of those functions which
      had hitherto been surrounded with a halo and had enjoyed superstitious veneration.
    </div>
<div class="noindenttb" id="ch16--241">
      Since Adam Smith thought that the expenses for these “unproductive laborers” should be cut down to the
      indispensable minimum—
    </div>
<div class="bq" id="ch16--242">
      In the first place therefore it becomes a principal task for the sycophants of this society, and especially of
      the upper classes, to restore in theoretical terms even the purely parasitic section of these “unproductive
      laborers,” or to justify the exaggerated claims of the section which is indispensable. The <em class="calibre8" id="ch16--243">dependence</em> of the ideological, etc., classes<a class="calibre6" id="ch16en4-r"></a><a class="nounder1" href="43.html#ch16en4" id="ch16--245">*</a> on the <em class="calibre8" id="ch16--246">capitalists</em> was in fact
      proclaimed.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch16--247"><a class="calibre14" id="ch16fn32"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch16fn32-r" id="ch16--249">32</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="indent" id="ch16--250">
      But why did Adam Smith put forward this offensive view? Why was he, unlike his successors, able to write that
      “The labor of some of the most respectable orders in the society is, like that of menial servants, unproductive
      of any value,” that kings and generals and such are unproductive, hence maintained out of the product of other
      people’s industry, that “In the same class must be ranked … churchmen, lawyers, physicians, men of letters of all
      kinds; players, buffoons, musicians, opera-singers, opera-dancers, etc.”?
    </div>
<div class="indentb" id="ch16--251">
      “This is the language of the still revolutionary bourgeoisie, which has not yet subjected to itself the whole of
      society, the state, etc.,” explained Marx. But—
    </div>
<div class="bqi" id="ch16--252">
      When on the other hand the bourgeoisie has conquered the field, partly itself taking over the state, partly
      making a compromise with its former possessors, and has likewise given recognition to the ideological orders as
      flesh of its flesh and everywhere transformed them into its functionaries, of like nature to itself; when it
      itself no longer confronts these as the representative of <a class="calibre6" id="page_495"></a>productive labor, but when the
      real productive laborers rise against it and moreover tell it that it lives on other people’s industry; when it
      is educated enough not to be entirely absorbed in production, but to want also to consume “in a cultured way”;
      when the intellectual labors themselves are more and more performed in its <em class="calibre8" id="ch16--254">service</em> and
      enter into the service of capitalist production—then things take a new turn, and the bourgeoisie tries to justify
      “economically,” from its own standpoint, what it had previously criticized and fought against. … In addition to
      this, these economists, who themselves are priests, professors, etc., are eager to prove their “productive”
      usefulness, to justify their wages “economically.”<sup class="calibre13" id="ch16--255"><a class="calibre14" id="ch16fn33"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch16fn33-r" id="ch16--257">33</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="noindenttb" id="ch16--258">
      The bourgeoisie comes to accept the necessity of “a superstructure of ideological orders” functioning in its
      behalf.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch16--259"><a class="calibre14" id="ch16fn34"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch16fn34-r" id="ch16--261">34</a></sup> But this does not mean that all types of intellectual production share equally
      in the rewards. Different social systems favor different types of intellectual production.
    </div>
<div class="bq" id="ch16--262">
      Thus for example different kinds of intellectual production correspond to the capitalist mode of production and
      to the mode of production of the Middle Ages. If material production itself is not conceived in its <em class="calibre8" id="ch16--263">specific historical</em> form, it is impossible to understand what is specific in the intellectual
      production corresponding to it and the reciprocal influence of one on the other. Otherwise one cannot get beyond
      inanities….
    </div>
<div class="bqi" id="ch16--264">
      Further: from the specific form of material production arises in the first place a specific structure of society,
      in the second place a specific relation of men to nature. Their state system and their intellectual outlook are
      determined by both. Therefore also the kind of their intellectual production.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch16--265"><a class="calibre14" id="ch16fn35"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch16fn35-r" id="ch16--267">35</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="noindenttb" id="ch16--268">
      The relation between material and intellectual production is not a simple one, but some things can be said about
      capitalism:
    </div>
<div class="bq" id="ch16--269">
      For instance, capitalist production is hostile to certain branches of intellectual production, for example art
      and poetry. If this is left out of account, it opens the way to the illusions of the French in the eighteenth
      century …
    </div>
<div class="noindentt" id="ch16--270">
      This refers to the illusion that “Because we are further ahead than the ancients in mechanics, etc., why
      shouldn’t we be able to make an epic too?”—along with the conclusion that a dull poetic epic of Voltaire’s (Marx
      mentions the <em class="calibre8" id="ch16--271">Henriade</em>) must be greater than the <em class="calibre8" id="ch16--272">Iliad</em>!<sup class="calibre13" id="ch16--273"><a class="calibre14" id="ch16fn36"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch16fn36-r" id="ch16--275">36</a></sup> In
      other words, Marx is denying that socioeconomic progress entails intellectual <a class="calibre6" id="page_496"></a>advance in
      some automatic way. But if “capitalist production is hostile to certain branches of intellectual production,” it
      is on the other hand usually thought to favor other branches—for example, science.
    </div>
<h3 class="h2" id="ch16lev6">6. THE PLACE OF SCIENTIFIC LABOR</h3>
<div class="indent" id="ch16--278">
      No one doubts that a would-be epic writer in modern Los Angeles, Liverpool, Lyons or Leipzig has a “specific
      historical” disadvantage compared with a bard in an ancient preliterate society. Modern society is hostile to
      this form of intellectual production. But isn’t the case different for those intellectual laborers of today who
      produce an immaterial good (knowledge) far more important to capitalist interests, namely, scientists?
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch16--279">
      The case is indeed different for certain scientists and for certain fields of knowledge, specifically those that
      affect the forms and level of production. In fact, so basic is this difference that Marx’s <em class="calibre8" id="ch16--280">Capital</em> makes this type of intellectual labor into an economic category of its own, called
      “general labor,” differentiated from “collective labor.”<a class="calibre6" id="ch16en5-r"></a><a class="nounder1" href="43.html#ch16en5" id="ch16--282">*</a> General labor is “all scientific labor, all discovery and all invention.” It
      utilizes the labor of previous workers (scientists, inventors, and so on) in addition to the cooperative labors
      of existing scientific workers; whereas the other and more usual category of labor comprises only the direct
      labor exerted by (existing) individuals.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch16--283"><a class="calibre14" id="ch16fn37"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch16fn37-r" id="ch16--285">37</a></sup> If this category of labor is “general,” it is because of its
      general application: not merely to a particular commodity or labor-process but to all subsequent applications of
      labor in a given labor-process. Through this means, the productive power of (ordinary, collective) labor is
      increased by “progress in the field of intellectual production, notably natural science and its practical
      application.”<sup class="calibre13" id="ch16--286"><a class="calibre14" id="ch16fn38"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch16fn38-r" id="ch16--288">38</a></sup>

      Marx points to other cases where society develops powers that cost the capitalist nothing, yet increase the power
      of production—for example, development of the division of labor, or the growth of population. “Another force of
      production which costs it [capital] nothing is°scientific power.° … In short, all the social powers that develop
      with <a class="calibre6" id="page_497"></a>the growth of population and the historical development of society cost it
      nothing.”<sup class="calibre13" id="ch16--291"><a class="calibre14" id="ch16fn39"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch16fn39-r" id="ch16--293">39</a></sup> Like the collective power of labor, indeed like all the social powers of
      production, science (or “scientific power”) appears as the collective power of capital. Scientific power is just
      another, though very important, case “where the combination and, as it were, the communal spirit of labor is
      transferred into the machine etc.”<sup class="calibre13" id="ch16--294"><a class="calibre14" id="ch16fn40"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch16fn40-r" id="ch16--296">40</a></sup> It must not be thought that this applies only to science of some
      high-level sort; on the contrary, the economic principle equally involves the crystallization of various sorts of
      <em class="calibre8" id="ch16--297">skill</em> into the embodiment of machinery.
    </div>
<div class="bq" id="ch16--298">
      Capital, in its real development, combines mass labor with skill, but in such a way that the former loses its
      physical power and the skill exists not in the laborer but in the machine and the factory operating as a whole
      through [a] scientific combination with the machine. The social spirit of labor achieves an objective existence
      apart from the individual laborers.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch16--299"><a class="calibre14" id="ch16fn41"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch16fn41-r" id="ch16--301">41</a></sup>

      In fact, in this whole discussion <em class="calibre8" id="ch16--303">science</em> is best given its broad German sense of <em class="calibre8" id="ch16--304">Wissenschaft</em>—accumulated knowledge and know-how. The body of discovered knowledge which is
      objectified in a machine of advanced design, or in a set of factory procedures leading to greater productivity,
      is not basically different from the body of technical knowledge which permitted a master worker in a medieval
      guild to outproduce the novice who had not yet learned the trade. Marx discusses this situation as follows:
    </div>
<div class="bq" id="ch16--305">
      … in the guild system it must also become clear that the particular kind of property which labor creates is not
      based simply on labor or exchange of labor but on an objective connection of the worker with a community and
      conditions he finds given, on the basis of which he proceeds. These too are products of a [certain] labor, of the
      labor of world history; of the labor of the community—of its historical development, which does not proceed from
      the labor of individuals nor the exchange of their labors.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch16--306"><a class="calibre14" id="ch16fn42"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch16fn42-r" id="ch16--308">42</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="indenttb" id="ch16--309">
      The contribution to capital made by this type of intellectual labor is, then, immense and beyond question; but to
      an equally immense degree it “costs capital nothing.” Marx generalizes on the tendency of capitalism toward
      undervaluing this type of intellectual labor:
    </div>
<div class="bqi" id="ch16--310">
      The product of mental labor—science—always stands far below its value, because the labor-time needed to reproduce
      it has no relation at all to the labor-time required for its original production. <a class="calibre6" id="page_498"></a>For
      example, a schoolboy can learn the binomial theorem in an hour.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch16--312"><a class="calibre14" id="ch16fn43"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch16fn43-r" id="ch16--314">43</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="noindenttb" id="ch16--315">
      For another example, the intellectual labor-time needed to develop the transistor has no relation at all to the
      labor-time required to produce it once the knowledge has been communicated. Everyone knows the slight reward to
      an inventor as compared with the harvest reaped by the entrepreneur who exploits the invention; but in addition
      Marx points out that even an initial entrepreneur often goes bankrupt; it is typically not the trail blazer who
      makes money out of a contribution by intellectual labor, but rather a later entrepreneur who benefits from a
      cheap buy-up:
    </div>
<div class="bq" id="ch16--316">
      It is, therefore, generally the most worthless and miserable sort of money-capitalists who draw the greatest
      profit out of all new developments of the general labor of the human intellect and their social application
      through combined labor.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch16--317"><a class="calibre14" id="ch16fn44"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch16fn44-r" id="ch16--319">44</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="noindentt" id="ch16--320">
      Of course, the intellectual laborer may be compensated for a lack of monetary reward by honors, prizes, and

<h3 class="h2" id="ch16lev7">7. INTELLECTUAL LABOR AND SOCIALISM</h3>
<div class="indent" id="ch16--322">
      But in scientists, inventors and such technological innovators we have been discussing the cream of the cream of
      intellectual laborers, from the standpoint of capitalism. The case is quite different with those laborers in the
      intellectual fields who are only an overhead expense or drain on the wealth produced by others: poets, for
      example, whose “production” of poems has exactly the same economic meaning for capital as a lunatic’s production
      of hallucinations. These intellectual producers have essentially the same economic relation to the capitalist as
      the latter’s valet, mistress, or bodyguard.
    </div>
<div class="indentb" id="ch16--323">
      The same goes for intellectual operatives who may be of far more value to the bourgeoisie than poets: for
      example, economics professors, ecclesiastical prelates, or eclectic philosophers. But these are valuable in the
      same way that the statesman or soldier is valuable. Marx takes up an economist’s challenge: the soldier who
      protects the harvest—is he not as “productive” as the farmer who reaps it? Marx’s answer (omitting the
      argumentation) is that the soldier certainly does produce something—he <a class="calibre6" id="page_499"></a>produces
      “defense”—but he does not produce surplus-value, that is, wealth in the capitalist form. Hence, in the framework
      of capitalism, he is not a productive worker
    </div>
<div class="bq" id="ch16--325">
      in the same way as a large part of the unproductive laborers who produce nothing themselves, either intellectual
      or material, but who are useful and necessary only because of the faulty social relations—they owe their
      existence to social evils.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch16--326"><a class="calibre14" id="ch16fn45"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch16fn45-r" id="ch16--328">45</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="indentt" id="ch16--329">
      But then there are also other intellectual laborers who owe their existence not to social evils or to the
      bourgeoisie’s special needs, but to general social needs. That does not necessarily help them a bit, as far as
      their economic relation to capital is concerned. They are equally part of the band of retainers that have to be
      fed out of the production of wealth by others.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch16--330">
      Differences among these various types of unproductive intellectual laborers do come into play, however, from
      another side.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch16--331">
      In time of business depression and industrial crisis, even productive workers in essential industries may be
      thrown on the scrapheap; the havoc in the field of luxury goods is even greater. The consumption of luxuries
      decreases; productive laborers engaged in the creation of luxury commodities are thrown out of work. What happens
      to unproductive laborers?
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch16--332">
      It goes without saying that the services of unproductive laborers will be less in demand on the whole (even if we
      allow for an increase in intellectual laborers skilled in explaining why the breakdown must not sap confidence in
      the system). Marx points out that they “receive for their services a portion of the capitalists’ luxury expense
      fund” which is now hard-hit. And besides, these unproductive intellectual laborers are not even luxury workers:
      “these laborers are themselves <em class="calibre8" id="ch16--333">pro tanto</em> luxuries.”<sup class="calibre13" id="ch16--334"><a class="calibre14" id="ch16fn46"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch16fn46-r" id="ch16--336">46</a></sup> Contributions to the
      symphony orchestra, university, church, or opera association come out of the same fund as expenditures for
      butlers, yachts, private chefs or fashionable paintings, and also, on a system-wide scale, out of the same fund
      as expenditures for prison wardens, generals, politicians, lawyers, judges, Boy Scout leaders, or asylum-keepers.
      The question then is posed materially of the order or priority enjoyed by various types of intellectual laborers
      in their claims on the “capitalists’ luxury expense fund.”
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch16--337">
      The case of an economic crisis underlines the problem of choice, but the question of priorities which is
      highlighted applies also to more constant situations. Other things being equal, what conditions maximize <a class="calibre6" id="page_500"></a>the amount of “living space” in the economy for the unproductive intellectual laborers? Under what
      conditions can a relatively high proportion of unproductive laborers live on available revenue—high in comparison
      with the proportion of productive workers?
    </div>
<div class="indentb" id="ch16--339">
      Marx points out that the answer to this question is quite different in the society of the medieval barons and
      that of the modern bourgeoisie. A baron could keep a relatively large band of retainers on the basis of a small
      total wealth, for reasons which do not obtain under capitalism. Today the proportion of unproductive laborers
      maintained can be kept large only
    </div>
<div class="bq" id="ch16--340">
      because the productivity of the productive laborers is large, and therefore their surplus produce upon which the
      retainers feed. In this case the labor of the productive laborers is not productive because there are so many
      retainers, but on the contrary—there are so many retainers because the labor of the productive laborers is so
      productive.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch16--341"><a class="calibre14" id="ch16fn47"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch16fn47-r" id="ch16--343">47</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="noindentt" id="ch16--344">
      We may well conclude that this proportion—the size of society’s band of unproductive laborers—may change again
      when socialist society succeeds the capitalist. Change how? If, as Marx and other socialists confidently expect,
      socialist society would lead to a great leap forward in the forces of production, the living space for
      intellectual labor would be vastly increased. This would be proposed as long-range effect. But in the short run,
      that is, for a period of transition, the picture may be more mixed.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch16--345">
      Let us (following another passage in Marx) assume a considerable initial increase in productivity, so great that
      the proportion of the population “directly engaged in material production” is reduced from two-thirds to
      one-third. If this gain were to be more or less evenly distributed (as in a socialist democracy), everybody
      “would have two-thirds more time for unproductive labor and leisure. But in capitalist production everything
      seems and in fact is contradictory.” What would in this case happen under capitalism? Of course, “the owners of
      profit and rent” would increase their revenue, as well as their retinue of unproductive laborers who provide them
      with services, including “the horde of flunkeys, the soldiers, sailors, police, lower officials, and so on,
      mistresses, grooms, clowns and jugglers.” These latter are examples of unproductive laborers of lower culture.
      But in addition there will also be an increase in “ill-paid artists, musicians, lawyers, physicians, scholars,
      schoolmasters, inventors, etc.” who “on the whole <a class="calibre6" id="page_501"></a>have a higher level of culture than the
      unproductive workers had previously.”<sup class="calibre13" id="ch16--347"><a class="calibre14" id="ch16fn48"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch16fn48-r" id="ch16--349">48</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="indent" id="ch16--350">
      Thus this last-named stratum of intellectual laborers may be directly benefited by the conditions of capitalist
      prosperity, and perhaps directly harmed by the immediate consequences of an equalitarian reorganization of
      society, along with noxious excrescences of capitalist society lopped off at the same time. In the short run, the
      efforts of a socialist society to catch up on the social deficit accumulated over centuries may mean that there
      will be less available for unproductive laborers in general and for the intellectual strata in particular. This
      refers only to tangible material rewards, of course: there are other goods and rewards, which can be read about
      at length in many socialist propaganda tracts arguing that intellectual elements will be happier on the whole in
      a socialist democracy than in an exploitive society. Such considerations may influence the happy few; but Marx
      might not be persuaded that rosy visions, even true ones, can be expected to move masses into struggle, even
      masses of intellectuals who themselves produce visions as their immaterial commodity. There is reason to believe
      that most vendors of the immaterial are hardly less determined than others to be paid in cash.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch16--351">
      In this respect the intellectual-labor segment of the capitalist retinue is not qualitatively different from
      others. They are far from homogeneous and far from singleminded in their service, but it is no common material
      interest as intellectuals (in any sense) that alienates them from it.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch16--352">
      A very minor conclusion from Marx’s analysis of intellectual labor is the pointlessness of the frequently posed
      question <em class="calibre8" id="ch16--353">Are the intellectuals a class?</em> If <em class="calibre8" id="ch16--354">class</em> is used in a
      popular nontechnical sense (meaning classification), as we have seen Marx or Engels do more than once, and if
      some meaningful definition of <em class="calibre8" id="ch16--355">intellectual</em> is fixed on, then an affirmative answer is as
      irrefutable as it is immaterial to our present subject. <a class="calibre6" id="ch16en6-r"></a><a class="nounder1" href="43.html#ch16en6" id="ch16--357">*</a> But if a socioeconomic class in the Marxist sense is meant, the answer is plainly
      no.
