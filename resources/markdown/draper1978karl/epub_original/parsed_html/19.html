<h2 class="h1" id="ch11"><a class="calibre4" id="page_288"></a>11 THE PETTY-BOURGEOISIE IN REVOLUTION</h2>
<div class="indent" id="ch11--2">
      As a step in economic analysis, for methodological reasons, Marx often treated society as if it were simplified
      down to the polar classes, bourgeoisie and proletariat, often plus the landowning class. Even in these contexts
      he did not neglect to caution that he was not examining “the actual composition of society, which by no means
      consists only of two classes, workers and industrial capitalists.”<sup class="calibre13" id="ch11--3"><a class="calibre14" id="ch11fn1"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch11fn1-r" id="ch11--5">1</a></sup> But this methodological simplification is seldom of
      use in political analysis; here other classes and class elements play a role that cannot be neglected.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch11--6">
      The role of the petty-bourgeoisie in the revolutionary process has already come in for notice in the course of
      the last four chapters, but there is a good deal to be added. In the first place, we must be sure to understand
      whom Marx meant by the petty-bourgeoisie. As with other class terms, we have to differentiate between popular
      usage and strict (scientific) definitions.
    </div>
<h3 class="h2" id="ch11lev1">1. DEFINITIONS</h3>
<div class="indent" id="ch11--8">
      Strictly speaking, the petty-bourgeoisie comprises those who make their living primarily by the exercise of their
      own labor with their self-owned means of production (tools) or other property (like a shop). They are, typically,
      self-employed small producers or tradespeople: carpenters working in their own shops, tailors working for their
      own customers, small merchants, and so on; in short, largely self-employed artisans and shopkeepers.<a class="calibre6" id="ch11en1-r"></a><a class="nounder1" href="43.html#ch11en1" id="ch11--10">*</a>
</div>
<div class="indent" id="ch11--11">
<a class="calibre6" id="page_289"></a>They are property owners, albeit in a small way. (We are concerned not with personal
      property but productive property, property used in the process of production.) But although property owners, they
      are not capitalists, that is, not employers living primarily by the extraction of surplus labor from
      wage-workers.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch11--13">
      This points to a basic distinction between bourgeoisie and petty-bourgeoisie, a distinction which the similarity
      in name tends to obscure.<a class="calibre6" id="ch11en2-r"></a><a class="nounder1" href="43.html#ch11en2" id="ch11--15">*</a> The
      petty-bourgeoisie is not the same as the small bourgeoisie, even though it may shade into the latter. The
      distinction centers on the degree to which wage-labor figures in the enterprise. The petty-bourgeoisie earn their
      living by dint of their own labor and their own property; the bourgeoisie live on earnings from the labor of
      others.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch11--16">
      Inevitably the petty-bourgeois sector shades off in two directions. Successful artisans or shopkeepers may begin
      to employ hired help, even though they themselves continue to work longer and harder than their “hands.” Further
      expansion may turn them into primarily employers of wage-laborers, even though they continue to manage the <a class="calibre6" id="page_290"></a>business personally. Thus they may become, in effect, small bourgeois (petty capitalists)
      combining three roles as capitalist, manager, and laborer. In the opposite direction, the petty-bourgeois may
      once have been, or in adversity may sink back to being, a journeyman or assistant laboring in another’s
      establishment—that is, may sink into the ranks of the proletariat. There is a continuum from the young apprentice
      or wage-worker, through the self-employed tradesperson, to the more affluent employer-manager.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch11--18">
      Scientifically speaking, there is also a rural petty-bourgeoisie: the peasantry, who work their own land with
      their own labor. As peasants shade off into employers of hired labor, like their urban counterparts, they may
      divide into small peasants, big peasants, middle peasants, in accordance with agreed-on limits. To be sure,
      etymologically the term <em class="calibre8" id="ch11--19">petty-bourgeoisie</em> suggests only inhabitants of “burgs” or towns;
      and it is common enough to speak of the petty-bourgeoisie <em class="calibre8" id="ch11--20">and</em> the peasantry, as we
      (following Marx) have done in previous chapters; but analytically it is important to see the common social
      position of both the urban and agrarian sectors of this class. However, specific discussion of the peasantry is
      reserved for the following chapters.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch11--21">
      Another ambiguity is caused by the confusion of <em class="calibre8" id="ch11--22">petty-bourgeoisie</em> and <em class="calibre8" id="ch11--23">middle class.</em> Whereas the former denotes a specific class that can be rigorously defined, <em class="calibre8" id="ch11--24">middle class</em> or <em class="calibre8" id="ch11--25">middle classes</em> has no fixed meaning whatever; this term
      takes on a meaning only from its context and the declared intention of the user. Especially in historical usage,
      it may refer to several different classes or combinations of classes.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch11--26">
      In their English-language writings and letters, Marx and Engels most often followed the common British practice
      of using <em class="calibre8" id="ch11--27">middle class</em> to mean the bourgeoisie proper, including the big
      bourgeoisie.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch11--28"><a class="calibre14" id="ch11fn5"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch11fn5-r" id="ch11--30">5</a></sup> In this way the bourgeoisie is seen in the middle between the landed aristocracy
      as upper class and the lower orders. This usage carried over by custom even to the United States and the U.S.
      press, even though it did not correspond to American reality. In the plural, <em class="calibre8" id="ch11--31">middle
      classes</em>, like as not, included also the petty-bourgeois strata, thus embracing various classes seen in the
      middle between the aristocracy and proletariat. In German, Marx and others were likely to use a term like <em class="calibre8" id="ch11--32">Mittelstand</em> as a common broad label for social elements intermediate between bourgeoisie and
      proletariat, without pinpointing a specific class.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch11--33"><a class="calibre14" id="ch11fn6"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch11fn6-r" id="ch11--35">6</a></sup> All this should be considered suggestive and admonitory, not
      exhaustive.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch11--36">
      Thus, statements about Marx’s views on the “middle class(es),” made without further specification, are often like
      essays on the Quiddity <a class="calibre6" id="page_291"></a>of What. This affects the alleged theory of the “disappearance of the
      middle classes” along with other quiddities.<a class="calibre6" id="ch11en3-r"></a><a class="nounder1" href="43.html#ch11en3" id="ch11--39">*</a>
</div>
<h3 class="h2" id="ch11lev2">2. THE JANUS CLASS</h3>
<div class="indent" id="ch11--41">
      Here we are particularly concerned with the sociopolitical characteristics of the petty-bourgeoisie that are of
      importance in the process of revolution. These characteristics flow from its class position. This class is
      inherently Janus-like.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch11--42">
      In his manuscript for the fourth volume of <em class="calibre8" id="ch11--43">Capital</em>, Marx made a special economic analysis
      of the petty-bourgeoisie. He asks, “What then is the position of independent handicraftsmen or peasants who
      employ no laborers and therefore do not produce as capitalists?” His first answer (omitting details) is the
      elementary one: “they are producers of commodities. But their production does not fall under the capitalist mode
      of production.” Then he suggests an interesting way of looking at this.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch11--44">
      These noncapitalist producers are operating within a framework in which capitalist relations predominate. A
      social order has a tendency to assimilate alien elements to itself; under feudalism, for example, even nonfeudal
      relations are given a feudal form; so too, capitalism. From this standpoint—
    </div>
<div class="bq" id="ch11--45">
      The independent peasant or handicraftsman is cut up into two persons. As owner of the means of production he is
      capitalist; as laborer he is his own wage-laborer. As capitalist he therefore pays himself his wages and draws
      his profit on his capital; that is to say, he exploits himself as wage-laborer, and pays himself, in the
      surplus-value, the tribute that labor owes to capital. Perhaps he also pays himself a third portion as landowner
      (rent), in exactly the same way …
    </div>
<div class="bqi2" id="ch11--46">
      … The means of production become capital only insofar as they have become separated from the laborer and confront
      labor as an independent power. But in the case referred to, the producer—the laborer—is the possessor, the owner,
      of his means of production. They are therefore not capital, any more than in relation to them he is a
      wage-laborer. Nevertheless, they are looked on as capital, and he himself is split in two, so that <em class="calibre8" id="ch11--47">he</em>, as capitalist, employs himself as wage-laborer.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch11--48"><a class="calibre14" id="ch11fn7"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch11fn7-r" id="ch11--50">7</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="noindentt" id="ch11--51">
<a class="calibre6" id="page_292"></a>This analysis also applies to the shopkeeper, if the merchant capitalist is taken as one of
      the “two persons.”<a class="calibre6" id="ch11en4-r"></a><a class="nounder1" href="43.html#ch11en4" id="ch11--54">*</a>
</div>
<div class="indent" id="ch11--55">
      In this double vision, the petty-bourgeois represent a living duplex, a class amalgam with an internal class
      struggle of their very own, a social schizoid (“cut up into two persons”).
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch11--56">
      The petty-bourgeois Janus faces two ways. On one side the petty-bourgeois confront the capitalist, on the other
      side the worker. Two different lines of demarcation run through them: (1) If aline is drawn between property
      owners and the propertyless, then they are property owners; and as such they can rejoice in their identity with
      millionaires and thrill to orations on the Rights of Property. (2) If a line is drawn between those who live by
      their own labor and those who live by others’ labor, then the petty-bourgeois belong with the former, and they
      are workers; and as such they can appreciate the grievances of the working classes, including the proletariat.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch11--57">
      The petty-bourgeois are therefore pulled in two directions. On the basis of the first demarcation, they can be
      taken in tow by the bourgeoisie. On the basis of the second, they have a community of interest, especially in the
      long run, with the proletariat as against the evils of the capitalist system.
    </div>
<div class="bq" id="ch11--58">
      Through the small amount of capital it owns, it [the petty-bourgeoisie] shares in the conditions of existence of
      the bourgeoisie; through the insecurity of its existence, in the conditions of the proletariat.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch11--59"><a class="calibre14" id="ch11fn9"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch11fn9-r" id="ch11--61">9</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="indentt" id="ch11--62">
      They are also victims of a squeeze from both directions. From above, they are crowded out by the pressure of more
      efficient capitals and oppressed by the policies of a government interested in the expansion of big industry
      rather than the tribulations of the local tailor. The “honest labor [of the petty-bourgeois] —even if it is only
      that of his workmen and apprentices—is daily more and more depreciated in value by the competition of large-scale
      production and machinery,” wrote <a class="calibre6" id="page_293"></a>Engels, with a parenthetical inclusion of the small
      employer (small bourgeois or petty capitalist).<sup class="calibre13" id="ch11--64"><a class="calibre14" id="ch11fn10"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch11fn10-r" id="ch11--66">10</a></sup> Marx had his share of being squeezed by shopkeepers but could
      see their side, as in an exasperated letter to Engels:
    </div>
<div class="bq" id="ch11--67">
      These lousy small shopkeepers are a pitiful class … A large—the largest—part of these shopkeepers suffer all the
      miseries of the proletariat, plux “anxiety” [Angst] and “enslavement to respectability,” but without the
      compensating self-reliance of the better workers.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch11--68"><a class="calibre14" id="ch11fn11"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch11fn11-r" id="ch11--70">11</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="indentt" id="ch11--71">
      On the other hand, from below the petty-bourgeois enterprisers may be harassed by the “laziness” of their
      apprentices, shop assistants, or other hired help, who will not share their enthusiasm for self-sweating. They
      may be especially vulnerable to “labor troubles” as small employers, for the poor mini-capitalist is driven to
      supersweating in order to extract from the labor of employees that which is needed to balance the advantages of a
      bigger competitor. They will resent the consumers who prefer the chain store to the corner grocery. Apart from
      these specific abrasions, the “lower classes” always loom before their consciousness as the social abyss into
      which they and their families will fall in case of economic failure.
    </div>
<h3 class="h2" id="ch11lev3">3. THE PETTY-BOURGEOIS AS CONTRADICTION</h3>
<div class="indent" id="ch11--73">
      It follows that the petty-bourgeoisie is a clot of contradictions, a mixture that cannot jell, a focus of social
      eclecticism. When it is a question of ideology, the contradictions may become logical ones, but in the first
      place they are social contradictions. Marx more than once took Proudhon as the very type, as in this early case:
    </div>
<div class="bq" id="ch11--74">
      From head to foot M. Proudhon is the philosopher and economist of the petty-bourgeoisie. In an advanced society
      the <em class="calibre8" id="ch11--75">petty-bourgeois</em> necessarily becomes from his very position a socialist on the one side
      and an economist [i.e., bourgeois economist] on the other; that is to say, he is dazed by the magnificence of the
      big bourgeoisie and has sympathy for the sufferings of the people. He is at once both bourgeois and man of the
      people. Deep down in his heart he flatters himself that he is impartial and has found <a class="calibre6" id="page_294"></a>the
      right equilibrium, which claims to be something different from the golden mean. A petty-bourgeois of this type
      glorifies <em class="calibre8" id="ch11--77">contradiction</em> [in his theorizing] because contradiction is the basis of his
      existence. He is himself nothing but social contradiction in action. He must justify in theory what he is in
      practice, and M. Proudhon has the merit of being the scientific interpreter of the French petty-bourgeoisie—a
      genuine merit, because the petty-bourgeoisie will form an integral part of all the impending social
      revolutions.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch11--78"><a class="calibre14" id="ch11fn12"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch11fn12-r" id="ch11--80">12</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="indentt" id="ch11--81">
      A year later, in his 1847 book on Proudhon, Marx emphasized the eclecticism of the type. Proudhon sees that
      “Every economic relation has a good and a bad side … He sees the good side expounded by the [bourgeois]
      economists; the bad side he sees denounced by the socialists.” He becomes “the man in search of formulas” by
      which to criticize both capitalism and communism, but fails “to rise, be it even speculatively, above the
      bourgeois horizon.”
    </div>
<div class="bq1" id="ch11--82">
      He wants to be the synthesis—he is a composite error.
    </div>
<div class="bqi2" id="ch11--83">
      He wants to soar as the man of science above the bourgeois and the proletarians; he is merely the
      petty-bourgeois, continually tossed back and forth between capital and labor, [bourgeois] political economy and
      communism.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch11--84"><a class="calibre14" id="ch11fn13"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch11fn13-r" id="ch11--86">13</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="noindentt" id="ch11--87">
      In a sketch of Proudhon eighteen years later, Marx again stressed the element of eclecticism:
    </div>
<div class="bq" id="ch11--88">
      … the petty-bourgeois is composed of on-the-one-hand and on-the-other-hand. This is so in his economic interests
      and <em class="calibre8" id="ch11--89">therefore</em> in his politics, in his religious, scientific and artistic views. So in his
      morals, in everything. He is a living contradiction. If, like Proudhon, he is in addition a clever man, he will
      soon learn to play with his own contradictions and develop them according to circumstances into striking,
      spectacular, now scandalous, now brilliant paradoxes.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch11--90"><a class="calibre14" id="ch11fn14"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch11fn14-r" id="ch11--92">14</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="indentt" id="ch11--93">
      Proudhon, of course, makes an excellent specimen because of his notorious enthusiasm for self-contradiction
      combined with his often overt admission “that his ideal is the petty-bourgeoisie.” He wants to dissolve both
      “extremes” of society, bourgeoisie and proletariat, into “the golden mean,” which is the petty-bourgeoisie—so
      comments Marx after reading Proudhon’s 1852 idealization of Bonaparte’s coup d’état.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch11--94"><a class="calibre14" id="ch11fn15"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch11fn15-r" id="ch11--96">15</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="indent" id="ch11--97">
      In general, hostility to both the bourgeoisie and the proletariat is a <a class="calibre6" id="page_295"></a>characteristic
      feature of the petty-bourgeois mentality; but in a society which is in fact dominated by the former, the balance
      can be maintained chiefly in phrases. Normally the petty-bourgeois <em class="calibre8" id="ch11--99">thinks</em> like a bourgeois
      even in order to formulate resentments against the bourgeoisie. There is a contradictory mixture, to be sure, but
      the bourgeois side of the contradiction tends to be uppermost. Petty-bourgeois Democrats, writes Marx,
    </div>
<div class="bq" id="ch11--100">
      who deny not merely the class struggle but even the existence of classes, only prove that, despite all their
      blood-curdling yelps and the humanitarian airs they give themselves, they regard the social conditions under
      which the bourgeois rules as the final product, the <em class="calibre8" id="ch11--101">non plus ultra</em> of history, and that
      they are only the servitors of the bourgeoisie.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch11--102"><a class="calibre14" id="ch11fn16"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch11fn16-r" id="ch11--104">16</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="noindentt" id="ch11--105">
      The petty-bourgeois ideologist arrives at the bourgeois standpoint in a “roundabout way,” through internalization
      of bourgeois standards as “eternal verities” of a nonclass nature.<a class="calibre6" id="ch11en5-r"></a><a class="nounder1" href="43.html#ch11en5" id="ch11--107">*</a>

<h3 class="h2" id="ch11lev4"><a class="calibre15" id="page_296"></a>4. INSTABILITY INSTITUTIONALIZED</h3>
<div class="indent" id="ch11--110">
      The same pattern that makes the petty-bourgeoisie self-contradictory also makes it vacillating and changeable,
      “constant in nothing but inconstancy.” This is merely contradictoriness expressed in time, but it deserves
      special mention. “While the old [medieval] burgherdom was the most stable class of society, the modern
      petty-bourgeoisie is the most changeable,” wrote Engels; “bankruptcy has become an institution with it.”<sup class="calibre13" id="ch11--111"><a class="calibre14" id="ch11fn22"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch11fn22-r" id="ch11--113">22</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="indent" id="ch11--114">
      Marx and Engels had plenty of opportunity to see this characteristic in action in the revolutionary years of
      1848-1849, both in Germany and France. In Paris, soon after the February revolution, Engels observed the
      following about the party of Lamartine and <em class="calibre8" id="ch11--115">Le National:</em>
</div>
<div class="bq" id="ch11--116">
      The petty-bourgeoisie play a mediating but very miserable role…. They, and with them the Provisional Government,
      vacillate very much. The quieter everything gets, the more the government and the petty-bourgeois party incline
      toward the big bourgeoisie; the more disturbed things get, the more they side with the workers….
    </div>
<div class="bqi2" id="ch11--117">
      The biggest misfortune is that the government must, on the one hand, make promises to the workers and, on the
      other, be unable to keep them, since it does not have the courage to assure itself the necessary financial means
      by taking revolutionary measures against the bourgeoisie … The <em class="calibre8" id="ch11--118">La Reforme</em> people are
      allowed to make promises, and then, by the most inept and conservative decisions, it is made impossible for them
      to make good on what they have promised.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch11--119"><a class="calibre14" id="ch11fn23"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch11fn23-r" id="ch11--121">23</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="noindentt" id="ch11--122">
      The elements of the petty-bourgeoisie may be viewed as iron filings pulled by opposite poles, that is, by the
      polar classes; revolution whips up a magnetic storm.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch11--123">
      In the following passage from his account of the German campaign of 1849, Engels treats the small bourgeoisie and
      the petty-bourgeoisie interchangeably:
    </div>
<div class="bq1" id="ch11--124">
      If it depended on the small bourgeoisie, it would hardly abandon the juridical basis of legal, peaceful and
      well-behaved struggle and take up muskets and paving-stones instead of so-called moral weapons. In Germany, as in
      France and England, the history of all political movements since 1830 shows us that this class is always
      boastful, full of big talk, and here and there even <a class="calibre6" id="page_297"></a>extreme in its phraseology, as long as
      it sees no danger; fainthearted, cautious and mealy-mouthed as soon as the slightest danger approaches;
      dumbfounded, worried and vacillating as soon as the movement it stirred up is seized on by other classes and
      taken seriously; betraying the whole movement for the sake of its petty-bourgeois existence as soon as things get
      to the point of struggle with arms in hand—and finally, as a result of its indecisiveness, always eminently duped
      and maltreated as soon as the reactionary party wins.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch11--126"><a class="calibre14" id="ch11fn24"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch11fn24-r" id="ch11--128">24</a></sup>

<div class="indentt" id="ch11--129">
      This same teeter-totter between crowing and cowering was likewise what Marx observed of the petty-bourgeoisie in
      time of crisis:
    </div>
<div class="bq" id="ch11--130">
      … the revolutionary threats of the petty-bourgeois and their Democratic representatives are mere attempts to
      intimidate their antagonist. And when they have run into a blind alley, when they have sufficiently compromised
      themselves to make it necessary to give effect to their threats, then this is done in an ambiguous fashion that
      avoids nothing so much as the means to the end and tries to find excuses for succumbing. The blaring overture
      that announced the contest dies away in a pusillanimous snarl as soon as the struggle has to begin, the actors
      cease to take themselves <em class="calibre8" id="ch11--131">au sérieux</em>, and the action collapses completely, like a pricked
      bubble.

      And he links this with the fact that the petty-bourgeoisie is an <em class="calibre8" id="ch11--133">Übergangsklasse</em>
      (transition class), that is, an in-between class, a class shading off into the bourgeoisie or the proletariat—one
      “in which the interests of the two classes are simultaneously mutually blunted.” In consequence the
      petty-bourgeois “imagines himself elevated above class antagonism generally.”<sup class="calibre13" id="ch11--134"><a class="calibre14" id="ch11fn25"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch11fn25-r" id="ch11--136">25</a></sup>

      Volatility is especially characteristic of what has been called “the petty-bourgeoisie in a frenzy,” that is,
      when this class is driven to the wall by forces beyond its control (as always) and beyond its understanding (as
      usual). The French petty-bourgeoisie had been active in the February revolution of 1848 along with the working
      class in the coalition entitled “the People,” but afterwards it found itself with empty hands. Something had gone
      wrong. Its discontent, which might have been dangerous to the bourgeois Provisional Government, was siphoned off
      into fury against a scapegoat, against the boondoggling of the so-called “national workshops,” which were
      supposed to be a working-class concession. And so “they sought the reason for their <a class="calibre6" id="page_298"></a>misery”
      in the workers’ movement. Marx explains: “no one was more fanatic about the alleged machinations of the
      Communists than the petty-bourgeoisie, who hovered helplessly on the brink of bankruptcy.”<sup class="calibre13" id="ch11--139"><a class="calibre14" id="ch11fn26"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch11fn26-r" id="ch11--141">26</a></sup>

<div class="indent" id="ch11--143">
      A detailed political portrait of the petty-bourgeoisie winds through Engels’ history of the German revolution of
      1848-1849.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch11--144">
      First, an identification of the class, repeating some of the matter we have already covered Engels’ language here
      is adapted for the readers of the <em class="calibre8" id="ch11--145">New York Tribune.</em>
</div>
<div class="bq1" id="ch11--146">
      °°The small trading and shopkeeping class is exceedingly numerous in Germany, in consequence of the stinted
      development which the large capitalists and manufacturers, as a class, have had in that country. In the larger
      towns it forms almost the majority of the inhabitants; in the smaller ones it entirely predominates, from the
      absence of wealthier competitors or influence. This class, a most important one in every body politic, and in all
      modern revolutions, is still more important in Germany, where, during the recent struggles, it generally played
      the decisive part. Its intermediate position between the class of larger capitalists, traders, and manufacturers,
      the bourgeoisie properly so-called, and the proletarian or industrial class, determines its character. Aspiring
      to the position of the first, the least adverse turn of fortune hurls the individuals of this class down into the
      ranks of the second.
    </div>
<div class="noindentt" id="ch11--147">
      Its vacillatory instability is next emphasized:
    </div>
<div class="bq" id="ch11--148">
      Thus eternally tossed about between the hope of entering the ranks of the wealthier class, and the fear of being
      reduced to the state of proletarians or even paupers; between the hope of promoting their interests by conquering
      a share in the direction of public affairs, and the dread of rousing, by ill-timed opposition, the ire of a
      Government which disposes of their very existence, because it has the power of removing their best customers;
      possessed of small means, the insecurity of the possession of which is in the inverse ratio of the amount,—this
      class is extremely vacillating in its views. Humble and crouchingly submissive <a class="calibre6" id="page_299"></a>under a
      powerful feudal or monarchical Government, it turns to the side of Liberalism when the middle class is in the
      ascendant; it becomes seized with violent democratic fits as soon as the middle class has secured its own
      supremacy, but falls back into the abject despondency of fear as soon as the class below itself, the
      proletarians, attempts an independent movement. We shall by and by [in this history] see this class, in Germany,
      pass alternately from one of these stages to the other.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch11--150"><a class="calibre14" id="ch11fn27"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch11fn27-r" id="ch11--152">27</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="indentt" id="ch11--153">
      Engels acidly exhibits the chasm between phrases and deeds for these elements; but it must not be supposed that
      the apparent hypocrisy which results is merely a moral defect. This hypocrisy, besides being as always the
      sincere homage vice pays to virtue, is an honest reflection of the <em class="calibre8" id="ch11--154">social</em> predicament of
      the petty-bourgeois. Impelled toward valiant resistance to evil, they speak accordingly; incapable of militant
      implementation in action, they act accordingly.
    </div>
<div class="bq" id="ch11--155">
      °°This class had always been more forward in its demands than the Liberal-Monarchico-Constitutional bourgeoisie;
      it had shown a bolder front, it had very often threatened armed resistance, it was lavish in its promises to
      sacrifice its blood and its existence in the struggle for freedom; but it had already given plenty of proofs that
      on the day of danger it was nowhere, and that it never felt more comfortable than the day after a decisive
      defeat, when everything being lost, it had at least the consolation to know that somehow or other the matter
      <em class="calibre8" id="ch11--156">was</em> settled.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch11--157"><a class="calibre14" id="ch11fn28"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch11fn28-r" id="ch11--159">28</a></sup>

    </div>
<div class="bq1" id="ch11--162">
      °°The petty bourgeoisie, great in boasting, is very impotent for action and very shy in risking anything. The
      <em class="calibre8" id="ch11--163">mesquin</em> [shabby-mean] character of its commercial transactions and its credit operations
      is eminently apt to stamp its character with a want of energy and enterprise; it is, then, to be expected that
      similar qualities will mark its political career.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch11--164"><a class="calibre14" id="ch11fn29"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch11fn29-r" id="ch11--166">29</a></sup>

<div class="noindentt" id="ch11--167">
      The petty-bourgeoisie fails “by showing in politics the same shortsighted pusillanimous, wavering spirit, which

      The upshot was seen in the armed campaign of 1849:
    </div>
<div class="bq" id="ch11--172">
<a class="calibre6" id="page_300"></a>Accordingly, the petty bourgeoisie encouraged insurrection by big words and great boasting
      as to what it was going to do; it was eager to seize upon power as soon as the insurrection, much against its
      will, had broken out; it used this power to no other purpose but to destroy the effects of the insurrection.
      Wherever an armed conflict had brought matters to a serious crisis, there the shopkeepers stood aghast at the
      dangerous situation created for them; aghast at the people who had taken their boasting appeals to arms in
      earnest; aghast at the power thus thrust into their own hands; aghast, above all, at the consequences for
      themselves, for their social positions, for their fortunes, of the policy in which they were forced to engage
      themselves. Were they not expected to risk “life and property,” as they used to say, for the cause of the
      insurrection? Were they not forced to take official positions in the insurrection, whereby, in case of defeat,
      they risked the loss of their capital? And in case of victory, were they not sure to be immediately turned out of
      office and see their entire policy subverted by the victorious proletarians who formed the main body of their
      fighting army? Thus placed between opposing dangers which surrounded them on every side, the petty bourgeoisie
      knew not to turn its power to any other account than to let everything take its chance, whereby, of course, there
      was lost what little chance of success there might have been, and thus to ruin the insurrection altogether. Its
      policy, or rather want of policy everywhere was the same, and, therefore, the insurrections of May, 1849, in all
      parts of Germany, are all cut out of the same pattern.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch11--174"><a class="calibre14" id="ch11fn31"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch11fn31-r" id="ch11--176">31</a></sup>

<h3 class="h2" id="ch11lev6">6. PETTY-BOURGEOIS AS ANTI-SEMITE</h3>
<div class="indent" id="ch11--179">
      The swing role of the petty-bourgeoisie goes all the way from an instrument of the Democracy to an instrument of
      the reaction, depending on the historical position. Before 1848 the German petty-bourgeoisie had already shown a
      fat reactionary streak; this was the side that Marx had one-sidedly generalized in the Manifesto. The
      revolutionary period tumbled it pell-mell to the left, as a vacillating component <a class="calibre6" id="page_301"></a>of the
      Democracy. The ensuing period of rapid industrial development muted social antagonisms temporarily. Then the
      sharp economic crisis of 1873 revealed the full extent to which the old <em class="calibre8" id="ch11--181">Mittelstand</em> had
      been undermined, by the powerfully developing bourgeoisie on the one hand, and the powerfully growing
      working-class movement on the other.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch11--182">
      In 1878 came a two-pronged attack on the socialist proletariat: Bismarck put through the Anti-Socialist Law,
      illegalizing the Social-Democratic Party; and his court chaplain Stoecker launched an attempt at a rival mass
      movement, the Christian Social party. After a brief unsuccessful experiment in appealing to workers, Stoecker
      reoriented to aim squarely at the mass of petty-bourgeois elements with a program of political anti-Semitism and
      social demagogy. But it was with the rise of a racialist and pseudoradical (oppositionist) movement of organized
      anti-Semitism that the petty-bourgeoisie really came into its own as the mass reservoir for this tendency; for
      this movement reflected its social contradictions as it was ground between hammer and anvil.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch11--183"><a class="calibre14" id="ch11fn32"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch11fn32-r" id="ch11--185">32</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="indent" id="ch11--186">
      Engels saw the social roots of this movement in the precapitalist elements of society, the elements that were
      being crowded out by the bourgeoisie without being proletarianized. “Anti-Semitism is the mark of a backward
      culture,” Engels begins in a letter:
    </div>
<div class="bq1" id="ch11--187">
      In Prussia it is the lower aristocracy, the Junkers, who take in 10,000 marks and spend 20,000 and therefore
      become forfeit to usurers, that deal in anti-Semitism; and in Prussia and Austria it is the petty-bourgeois, the
      guild artisan and small shopkeeper who have met ruin through big-capitalist competition, that form their chorus
      and scream along with them. But if capital is annihilating <em class="calibre8" id="ch11--188">these</em> classes of society,
      which are reactionary through and through, it is performing its function, and is doing good work, regardless of
      whether it is Semitic or Aryan, circumcised or baptised; it helps backward Prussia and Austria to go forward,
      finally to arrive at the modern standpoint where all the old social differences are merged into the one big
      antithesis of capitalists and wage-workers. Only where this is not yet the case, where no strong capitalist class
      exists yet, therefore also no strong class of wage-workers, where capital is still too weak to take control of
      the whole of national production and hence has the Stock Exchange as its main theater of activity, where
      therefore production is still in the hands of peasants, lords of the manor, artisans and similar classes
      inherited from the Middle Ages—only there is <a class="calibre6" id="page_302"></a>capital particularly Jewish and only there does
      anti-Semitism arise.
    </div>
<div class="noindentt" id="ch11--190">
      But in America and England (continues Engels) where the capitalists are far richer than the Rothschilds, and also
      in the Rhineland, the capitalists are not Jewish.
    </div>
<div class="bq1" id="ch11--191">
      Anti-Semitism therefore is nothing else than a reaction of medieval, declining social strata against modern
      society, which essentially comprises capitalists and wage-workers, and therefore anti-Semitism serves only
      reactionary ends under a speciously socialistic cover; it is a variety of feudal-socialism, and with that we can
      have nothing to do.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch11--192"><a class="calibre14" id="ch11fn33"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch11fn33-r" id="ch11--194">33</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="noindentt" id="ch11--195">
      This dealt with the anti-Semitic movement then arising in Germany. How the social role and basis of anti-Semitism
      was later manipulated by more modern rulers is of course another story.
    </div>
<h3 class="h2" id="ch11lev7">7. AT ARM’S LENGTH</h3>
<div class="indent" id="ch11--197">
      Whatever revolutionary noises may emanate at times from petty-bourgeois circles, a consistent and independent
      revolutionary leadership cannot be expected to emerge from it: on the contrary, “the petty-bourgeoisie can
      preserve a revolutionary attitude toward the bourgeoisie only as long as the proletariat stands behind it.” This
      was Marx’s conclusion from the experience in France: the petty-bourgeois Republican party (Ledru-Rollin’s group
      around <em class="calibre8" id="ch11--198">La Réforme</em>) helped the government suppress the proletariat in 1848-1849, and “Thus
      they themselves blasted the background against which their party stood out as a power …”<sup class="calibre13" id="ch11--199"><a class="calibre14" id="ch11fn34"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch11fn34-r" id="ch11--201">34</a></sup> They
      pulled the rug from under their own feet.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch11--202">
      Petty-bourgeois parties have played significant roles in politics in various countries, but typically not leading
      roles. They can act as a front—prominent but not dominant.
    </div>
<div class="bq1" id="ch11--203">
      The small farmers and the petty-bourgeois [wrote Engels about America] will hardly ever succeed in forming a
      strong party: they consist of elements that change too rapidly … but to make up for it they are a splendid
      element for politicians, who speculate on their discontent in order to sell them out to one of the big parties
      afterward.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch11--204"><a class="calibre14" id="ch11fn35"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch11fn35-r" id="ch11--206">35</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="indentt" id="ch11--207">
      It follows that the role of petty-bourgeois elements inside the <a class="calibre6" id="page_303"></a>working-class movement must
      be viewed with caution, if not apprehension, as we have already mentioned. Marx and Engels urged time and again
      that they be held at arm’s length.
    </div>
<div class="bq1" id="ch11--209">
      The accession of petty-bourgeois and peasants [wrote Engels to Bebel in 1879] is indeed a sign of the rapid
      progress of the movement, but also a danger for it, as long as one forgets that these people have to come over
      and come over only <em class="calibre8" id="ch11--210">because</em> they have to. Their accession is an indication that the
      proletariat has really become the leading class. But since they come over with petty-bourgeois and peasant
      conceptions and aspirations, one should not forget that the proletariat would forfeit its historical leading role
      if it made concessions to these conceptions and aspirations.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch11--211"><a class="calibre14" id="ch11fn36"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch11fn36-r" id="ch11--213">36</a></sup>

<div class="noindentt" id="ch11--214">
      This question will recur in connection with the role of intellectuals (in <a class="nounder1" href="27.html#ch18" id="ch11--215">Chapter 18</a>) and of reformism (in Volume 3).
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch11--216">
      Engels read a similar lecture to Paul Lafargue when the latter got inflated notions on the subject. Lafargue and
      Guesde had just won acquittal by a bourgeois jury on the charge of making “inflammatory” speeches, after a
      principled defense expounding the political meaning of the speeches in question. Lafargue, carried away by
      euphoria, thought the court victory indicated “a big step” toward winning bourgeois adherents: “It shows, to some
      extent, that the bourgeoisie is ready for some part of our theories.” On the other hand, Laura Marx Lafargue (who
      had a better political head than her husband) rather thought that the jury’s verdict reflected the resentment of
      small bourgeois against finance capital.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch11--217">
      Engels strongly agreed with Laura. In the ensuing correspondence it will be noted that the discussion refers to
      the small bourgeoisie and the petty-bourgeoisie interchangeably; these social circles shaded from one into the
      other.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch11--218">
      Engels makes two complementary points. The verdict <em class="calibre8" id="ch11--219">was</em> a significant victory—significant
      especially for what it showed about the useful conflicts inside the bourgeoisie’s lower ranks:
    </div>
<div class="bq" id="ch11--220">
      °°The bourgeoisie, from the moment it is faced by a conscious and organised proletariat, becomes entangled in
      hopeless contradictions between its liberal and democratic general tendencies <em class="calibre8" id="ch11--221">here</em>, and
      the repressive necessities of its defensive struggle against the proletariat <em class="calibre8" id="ch11--222">there.</em> A
      cowardly bourgeoisie, like the German and Russian, sacrifices its general class tendencies to the momentary
      advantages of brutal repression. But a bourgeoisie with a <a class="calibre6" id="page_304"></a>revolutionary history of its own,
      such as the English and particularly the French, cannot do that so easily. Hence that struggle within the
      bourgeoisie itself…
    </div>
<div class="noindentt" id="ch11--224">
      But “Paul exaggerates the significance of the Paris verdict in so far as it is a symptom of the accessibility of
      the industrial bourgeoisie for socialist ideas.”
    </div>
<div class="bq" id="ch11--225">
      The struggle between usurer and industrial capitalist is one within the bourgeoisie itself, and though no doubt a
      certain number of petty bourgeois will be driven over to us by the certainty of their impending expropriation
      <em class="calibre8" id="ch11--226">de la part des boursiers</em> [by the stock exchange operators], yet we can never hope to get
      the mass of them over to our side. Moreover, this is not desirable, as they bring their narrow class prejudices
      along with them. In Germany we have too many of them, and it is they who form the dead weight which trammels the
      march of the party.
    </div>
<div class="noindentt" id="ch11--227">
      And he continues with a prescient view of how petty-bourgeois recruits deform the ideas of socialism in the act
      of embracing them:
    </div>
<div class="bq" id="ch11--228">
      It will ever be the lot of the petty bourgeois—as a mass—to float undecidedly between the two great classes, one
      part to be crushed by the centralization of capital, the other by the victory of the proletariat. On the decisive
      day, they will as usual be tottering, wavering, and helpless, <em class="calibre8" id="ch11--229">se laisseront faire</em> [will
      let themselves be led without resistance], and that is all we want. Even if they come round to our views they
      will say: of course communism is the ultimate solution, but it is far off, maybe 100 years before it can be
      realised-in other words: we do not mean to work for its realisation neither in our, nor in our children’s
      lifetime. Such is our experience in Germany.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch11--230"><a class="calibre14" id="ch11fn37"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch11fn37-r" id="ch11--232">37</a></sup>

      The “experience in Germany” figured in a book Engels published the following year. He pointed to “petty-bourgeois
      socialism” as a tendency in the Social-Democratic Party, especially in the parliamentary fraction, and
      characterized it as follows:
    </div>
<div class="bq" id="ch11--234">
      … while the fundamental views of modern socialism and the demand for the transformation of all the means of
      production into social property are recognized as justified, the realization of this is declared possible only in
      the distant future, a future which for all practical purposes is quite out of sight. Thus, for the present one
      has to have recourse to mere social patchwork, and sympathy can be shown, according to circumstances, even with
      <a class="calibre6" id="page_305"></a>the most reactionary efforts for so-called “uplifting of the laboring class.” The existence
      of such a tendency is quite inevitable in Germany, the land of philistinism <em class="calibre8" id="ch11--236">par
      excellence</em>, particularly at a time when industrial development is violently and on a mass scale uprooting

<div class="indent" id="ch11--245">
      The preceding pages have sufficiently emphasized the negative aspects of the petty-bourgeoisie in politics, as
      seen by Marx, but, like any Janus, its other side demands attention too. As our iron-filings metaphor indicated,
      the human components of this class could be drawn in different directions. They were pulled in a reactionary
      direction insofar as they sought to turn back the clock of social development; they turned in a progressive
      direction insofar as they allied themselves with the proletarian movement for a joint battle against joint
      enemies.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch11--246">
      It is true that most of Marx’s and Engels’ remarks in this area were heavily tinged with caveats and cautions
      against relying on the revolutionary noises emanating from petty-bourgeois sources. This negative coloration was
      primarily derived not from theory but from sad experience.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch11--247">
      In <a class="nounder1" href="15.html#ch07" id="ch11--248">Chapter 7</a> we followed their thinking on the subject,
      the inclusion of the petty-bourgeoisie in the Democratic revolutionary alliance, up to the outbreak of
      revolution; here the negative cast derives strongly from the role played by Feudal Socialism and its variations
      such as “True Socialism.” Still, after some backing and filling especially on Marx’s <a class="calibre6" id="page_306"></a>part,
      they went into the first months of the revolution with considerable expectations from the Democratic
      petty-bourgeoisie. In the subsequent chapters we saw, weaving through the account of their developing views on
      the class basis of permanent revolution, a mounting disillusionment with the revolutionary potentialities of this
      class, as well as with the bourgeoisie. We saw that they were not overeager to accept the evidence as it piled
      up, and that even after expressing considerable awareness of the Democracy’s default, Marx was still willing to
      exert his influence on the Cologne left to swing it to support the petty-bourgeois Democracy in the election of
      January 1849.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch11--250"><a class="calibre14" id="ch11fn40"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch11fn40-r" id="ch11--252">40</a></sup> Their fingers were burnt again; the smart persisted.

<div class="indent" id="ch11--253">
      The political end-product of this disillusionment, however, was never the rejection of alliance with

      A month <em class="calibre8" id="ch11--255">before</em> the January 1849 election, Engels formulated a general attitude in an

      The Radical petty-bourgeois are socialistic simply because they clearly see before their eyes their own ruin,
      their transit to the proletariat. It is not as petty-bourgeois, as owners of a small capital, but as future

      revolutionizing the relations of capital and labor. Give them political power and they will soon forget all about
      the Organization of Labor. Political power, indeed, gives them—at least in the first moments of intoxication—the
      prospect of acquiring capital, of escaping the ruin that threatens. It is only when the armed proletarians stand

      Engels proceeded to answer his own question: No, the petty-bourgeois <a class="calibre6" id="page_307"></a>radicals (and the small

      The attitude that Engels expressed in this unpublished article became the attitude of the whole “Marx party”

      was written into the Address to the Communist League of March 1850. Even this battle plan for a revolutionary
      situation seen as immediately approaching did not exclude collaboration: it provided for marching together in a
      temporary united front of action.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch11--271"><a class="calibre14" id="ch11fn43"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch11fn43-r" id="ch11--273">43</a></sup> Mainly, its concern was proletarian hegemony in an alliance.

<div class="indent" id="ch11--274">
      But of course, as soon as the perspective shifted to the long-range political haul rather than immediate
      revolution, the strategic approach to petty-bourgeois radicalism had to shift too. The changeableness of the
      petty-bourgeoisie enforced changing tactics with respect to it. In the face of revolution, reformism exhausts its
      positive role. In “normal” times, which means in nonrevolutionary times, reformism still has a halfway role to
      play. In the programmatic pamphlet on <em class="calibre8" id="ch11--275">The Prussian Military Question and the German Workers
      Party</em> that Engels wrote in 1865 with Marx’s help, the generalizations about the role of the
      petty-bourgeoisie were suited to the time.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch11--276">
      “Its political situation is as contradictory as its social existence,” said the pamphlet, and it proceeded to
      acknowledge the positive side of its political trend:

<div class="bq" id="ch11--277">
      … in general, however, “pure-and-simple democracy” is its most accurate expression. Its political vocation is to
      push the bourgeoisie forward in their struggle against the remnants of the old society and especially against
      their own weakness and cowardice, and to help fight for those freedoms—freedom of the press, organization and
      assembly, universal suffrage, local self-government—which a timid bourgeoisie, in spite of the bourgeois nature
      of these demands, can do without, but without which the workers could never win their emancipation.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch11--278"><a class="calibre14" id="ch11fn44"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch11fn44-r" id="ch11--280">44</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="indentt" id="ch11--281">
      From time to time it was important to see that reaction in power not only increased the oppression of workers but
      also alienated intermediate strata—as when in 1890 Engels noted that the German government was losing support
      because of the tax burden, the high cost of living, military conscription, and the fear of war: “all this has
      done its <a class="calibre6" id="page_308"></a>work in alienating from the Government the peasant, the small tradesman, the
      workman, in fact the whole nation, with the exception of the few who profit by the State-created
      monopolies.”<sup class="calibre13" id="ch11--283"><a class="calibre14" id="ch11fn45"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch11fn45-r" id="ch11--285">45</a></sup> All this increased the number of disadvantaged social strata and elements whom
      a revolutionary proletariat could hope to lead eventually toward revolution. But the main strategic lesson
      remained fixed: the volatile petty-bourgeoisie, and petty-bourgeois radicalism in particular, could be won over
      to the leadership of a revolutionary proletariat not by making concessions to its halfheartedness but by standing
      up against it, by steadfast opposition.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch11--286">
      This was still the main lesson Engels drew, for the edification of the German movement of the 1880s, as he
      reviewed the experience of 1848-1849:

<div class="bq" id="ch11--287">

      tamer and more amenable it became towards us. The more sharply and resolutely one opposes it, the more readily it
      ducks and the more concessions it makes to the workers’ party. Of that we have become convinced.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch11--288"><a class="calibre14" id="ch11fn46"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch11fn46-r" id="ch11--290">46</a></sup>

<h3 class="h2" id="ch11lev9">9. THE “ONE REACTIONARY MASS” FORMULA</h3>
<div class="indent" id="ch11--292">
      From Marx’s standpoint, it is important to understand the mixed-up factors at war in the political soul of the
      intermediate class strata, because this situation suggests a diversity of possibilities for their relationship to
      the proletarian revolutionary movement, rather than a predetermined negation.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch11--293">
      To be sure, the diversity has limits—the limits of radicalization for petty-bourgeois souls—but we have seen that
      Marx and Engels never left this unstressed. They were never in danger of becoming overoptimistic about this side
      of the petty-bourgeois Facing-Both-Ways.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch11--294">
      Both the petty-bourgeoisie and the peasantry (the urban and rural sectors of the class) are “classes that are on
      the decline and <em class="calibre8" id="ch11--295">reactionary</em> in relation to the proletariat as soon as they aspire to
      maintain themselves <a class="calibre6" id="page_309"></a>artificially,” wrote Engels.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch11--297"><a class="calibre14" id="ch11fn47"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch11fn47-r" id="ch11--299">47</a></sup> But they are not
      reactionary under all social conditions; not all sectors of the class are equally reactionary under the same
      conditions; different sectors and groups might vary widely on different issues; and last but not least, the
      difference must always be borne in mind between parties and groups based on this class and the possibilities of
      recruiting the rank and file of the class or of parts of it, in a fight against their own parties. In other
      words, we enter the realm of intelligent political leadership of a broad revolutionary movement that is striving
      to reach out, without compromising its own politics, as against the wooden drill of a self-pickling sect.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch11--300">
      Among the many differences that expressed the gulf between Marx and the Lassallean sect at the inception of the
      German socialist movement was their counterposed views on the question before us: the attitude of proletarian
      socialists toward the intermediate class strata. Whereas Marx and Engels after 1849 can hardly be considered soft
      on the petty-bourgeoisie, it remained for the Lassalleans to announce the discovery that, relative to the working
      class, “all other classes form only one reactionary mass.”<sup class="calibre13" id="ch11--301"><a class="calibre14" id="ch11fn47a"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch11fn47-ra" id="ch11--303">47a</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="indent" id="ch11--304">
      The “one reactionary mass” theory was going to have a prosperous career among various socialist sects, but Marx
      denounced it as soon as it showed up. The formula was embodied in the draft of the “Gotha program” which was
      written in 1875 to unify the Eisenacher party of Bebel and Liebknecht with the Lassallean organization, to form
      the German Social-Democracy. Marx attacked it as “nonsense” in his <em class="calibre8" id="ch11--305">Critique of the Gotha
      Program</em>, one section of which was devoted to this issue.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch11--306">
      A blanket formula like the “one reactionary mass” phrase meant that the working class had no possibility of
      gaining allies. It was doomed to isolation from other oppressed sections of the people, not simply for revolution
      but indeed for any significant social struggles. Moreover, the concept condemned in advance any effort to gain
      such allies as unprincipled. For this reason it sounded very revolutionary, very leftist and uncompromising. But
      in fact it was a formula for restricting the proletarian movement to its own corner of society. It is a classic
      example of a reactionary-sectarian concept taking an ultraleft form as disguise. As such, it was hard to handle,
      and extraordinarily well suited to promote all-around confusion.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch11--307">
      It is easy to see how it fitted in with the Lassalleans’ predilections, which were the opposite of Marx’s.
      Lassalle, despite the radical phrases <a class="calibre6" id="page_310"></a>about all upper classes, looked to an alliance also;
      but his longed-for alliance was not with the progressive bourgeois movement against the old regime, but rather,
      with the Bismarckian monarchy against its progressive bourgeois opposition. For this purpose it was useful to
      denounce all nonproletarian elements as an undifferentiated “reactionary mass,” since this threw the bourgeois
      liberals and their aims into the same bag with the feudo-aristocracy and the Bismarckian bureaucracy. All cats
      became black in this murk. Flirting with, or maneuvering in alliance with, one or another wing of the
      “reactionary mass” became simply a tactical question of practical expedience; it was no more discreditable to
      line up with Bismarck against bourgeois democracy than vice-versa. Marx put this down in so many words when he
      explained that Lassalle’s motivation was “to put a good color on his alliance with absolutist and feudal
      opponents against the bourgeoisie.” The formula, he remarked with ironic restraint, is “indeed not at all
      displeasing to Herr Bismarck.”
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch11--309">
      Marx pointed challengingly to the gap between the swaggering revolutionism of the formula and the actual
      electoral policy of the Lassalleans:
    </div>
<div class="bq1" id="ch11--310">
      Has one proclaimed to the artisans, small manufacturers, etc., and <em class="calibre8" id="ch11--311">peasants</em> during the

      form only one reactionary mass?<sup class="calibre13" id="ch11--312"><a class="calibre14" id="ch11fn48"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch11fn48-r" id="ch11--314">48</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="noindentt" id="ch11--315">
      The answer, of course, was no—the Lassalleans did not conceive their “one reactionary mass” theory as a guide to
      political action, but only as a rationalization for manipulation of their working-class constituency in a
      hoped-for deal with the antibourgeois reaction.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch11--316">
      It was embarrassing that the Lassalleans claimed to derive their reactionary formula from the <em class="calibre8" id="ch11--317">Communist Manifesto</em> itself. We saw (in <a class="nounder1" href="15.html#ch07" id="ch11--318">Chapter 7</a>) why this was possible: one of the weaknesses of the Manifesto was that it tended to
      treat the petty-bourgeoisie flatly as a part of reaction and not as a possible ally of the proletariat; nowhere
      did it recognize the character of petty-bourgeois politics as a form of reformism. This peculiarity of the
      Manifesto, submerged for a quarter century, now popped up to plague its authors.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch11--319">
      In his <em class="calibre8" id="ch11--320">Critique of the Gotha Program</em> Marx mentioned that “Lassalle knew the <em class="calibre8" id="ch11--321">Communist Manifesto</em> by heart, as his faithful followers know the gospels written by him,”
      but—claimed Marx—by inventing the “one reactionary mass” formula Lassalle “has falsified it grossly.” This was
      <a class="calibre6" id="page_311"></a>essentially true, since the Manifesto loudly and repeatedly stressed the progressiveness of
      the bourgeoisie as against the old order. The Manifesto was not ambiguous with respect to the differentiation of
      <em class="calibre8" id="ch11--323">bourgeois</em> progressiveness from absolutist reaction; it was ambiguous only in respect to
      the petty-bourgeoisie. And, of course, the Lassalleans were specially intent on throwing the bourgeoisie, not the
      petty-bourgeoisie, into the “one reactionary mass.”
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch11--324">
      Marx was therefore justified in arguing, in this Critique, that the Lassallean formula falsified the message of
      the Manifesto. Citing one of the passages of the Manifesto (not very aptly, by the way, but there were many such
      passages to choose from), Marx continued:
    </div>
<div class="bq1" id="ch11--325">
      The bourgeoisie is here [in the Manifesto] conceived as a revolutionary class—as the bearer of large-scale
      industry—as against the feudal elements and intermediate strata [<em class="calibre8" id="ch11--326">Mittel-ständen</em>] that
      desire to maintain all social positions created by obsolete modes of production.<a class="calibre6" id="ch11en7-r"></a><a class="nounder1" href="43.html#ch11en7" id="ch11--328">*</a> Therefore they do not form only one reactionary mass

</div>
<div class="noindentt" id="ch11--333">
      Not “together with the <em class="calibre8" id="ch11--334">bourgeoisie</em>,” true. But in this very refutation, we see that Marx
      has again bracketed the feudal elements and the <em class="calibre8" id="ch11--335">Mittelstände.</em>
</div>
<div class="indent" id="ch11--336">
      However, his next paragraph sets out to show that the <em class="calibre8" id="ch11--337">Communist Manifesto</em> said the same
      about the intermediate elements, and here he is on shaky ground. The Manifesto, writes Marx, “adds that the
      ‘intermediate elements … (become) revolutionary … in view of their impending transfer into the proletariat.’” And
      he claims that “therefore it is again nonsense to say that they [the intermediate strata] ‘form only one
      reactionary mass’ as against the working class, ‘together with the bourgeoisie’ and the feudal elements into the
      bargain.”
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch11--338">
      But here his quotation from the Manifesto is truncated and by no means reflects what that document said about the
      petty-bourgeoisie (which surely makes up a prominent part of the intermediate strata, the <em class="calibre8" id="ch11--339">Mittelstände</em>). The Manifesto, in the passage he quotes, had more to say about it:
    </div>
<div class="bq1" id="ch11--340">
      The intermediate strata, the small industrial, the small merchant, the artisan, the peasant, all these fight
      against the bourgeoisie, <a class="calibre6" id="page_312"></a>to safeguard their existence from ruin as intermediate strata. They
      are therefore not revolutionary, but conservative. Nay more, they are reactionary, for they try to roll back the
      wheel of history. If they are revolutionary, they are so in view of their impending transfer into the
      proletariat;<a class="calibre6" id="ch11en8-r"></a><a class="nounder1" href="43.html#ch11en8" id="ch11--343">*</a> they thus defend

</div>
<div class="noindentt" id="ch11--347">
      The Lassalleans could point to the flat statement, “they are reactionary,” even if Marx could point to the clear
      expectation that they could be led to “desert their own standpoint …” More important, the Manifesto contained
      other dismissals of the petty-bourgeoisie as reactionary, as already explained.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch11--348">
      The Lassallean claim that the “one reactionary mass” formula was based on the Manifesto might well have been
      confusing at the time, but it is not too hard to sort out now. The case is different with the confusions
      introduced by Engels’ discussions of the issue.

<h3 class="h2" id="ch11lev10">10. ENGELS ON “ONE REACTIONARY MASS”</h3>
<div class="indent" id="ch11--350">
      Shortly before Marx sent his critique of the Gotha program to the German party leadership, Engels sent an advance
      letter along the same lines. This letter likewise objects to accepting “Lassalle’s high-sounding but historically
      false phrase” that “in relation to the working class all other classes are only one reactionary mass.” But his
      main line of argument is a remarkable blunder.<a class="calibre6" id="ch11en9-r"></a><a class="nounder1" href="43.html#ch11en9" id="ch11--352">**</a>
</div>
<div class="indent" id="ch11--353">
<a class="calibre6" id="page_313"></a>“This proposition,” writes Engels, “is true only in a few exceptional cases: for instance,
      in a revolution of the proletariat, like the Commune …”<sup class="calibre13" id="ch11--355"><a class="calibre14" id="ch11fn53"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch11fn53-r" id="ch11--357">53</a></sup> On the contrary, the Paris Commune was an
      outstanding example of just the opposite pattern: widespread support to the revolutionary side by the
      intermediate classes and elements, including even some elements of the small bourgeoisie, and even some of their
      representative organizations in Paris itself. Marx had laid very great stress on precisely this aspect in his
      <em class="calibre8" id="ch11--358">Civil War in France</em>.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch11--359"><a class="calibre14" id="ch11fn54"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch11fn54-r" id="ch11--361">54</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="indent" id="ch11--362">
      The difference between Engels’ statement and the historical reality that was well known to him is so great that
      it raises the question of what he could have had in mind. The obvious answer—though hardly a justificatory
      one—was the reactionary solidarity of all political elements in the Versailles assembly, that is, on the
      counterrevolutionary side of the struggle; this “reactionary mass” extended even to the Proudhonists who were
      ex-leaders of the International, like Tolain. As in all revolutionary situations, a polarization took place: in
      Paris the tendency was for all political currents to rally around the Commune (the bourgeois exceptions fleeing
      to Versailles); on the other side of the barricades, open reaction formed the center of the coalition that
      extended down to a petty-bourgeois radical wing. On one side “one revolutionary mass,” on the other “one
      reactionary mass” (in Versailles). But this is not the same “one reactionary mass” figuring in the Lassallean
      formula. And even the Versailles reaction had shadings. In short, this statement of Engels’ falls to pieces as
      soon as it is examined.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch11--363">
      The second of the “exceptional cases” adduced by Engels is this: “… or in a country where not only the
      bourgeoisie has molded state and society in its own image but where in its wake the democratic petty-bourgeoisie,
      too, has already carried out this remolding down to its final consequences.”<sup class="calibre13" id="ch11--364"><a class="calibre14" id="ch11fn55"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch11fn55-r" id="ch11--366">55</a></sup> This seems to mean: in a
      country where bourgeois democratization has been carried out to its final limits— hence, <em class="calibre8" id="ch11--367">not</em> in Germany. This works as an argument against the application of the Lassallean formula to
      Germany; but does it work for the more advanced capitalist countries? Does it mean that, in a completely
      bourgeoisified democratic republic (say, the United States), everybody except the proletariat becomes
      “reactionary” and the final struggle <a class="calibre6" id="page_314"></a>takes place with the proletariat fighting alone?
      Without question Engels would reject this bizarre conclusion, but it is implied by his confused argument against
      the “one reactionary mass” formula.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch11--369">
      The trouble probably is that Engels is thinking not about a polarization of classes (people) but of <em class="calibre8" id="ch11--370">parties.</em> The distinction is vital in revolution. Engels might have meant to say that, as
      revolution comes on the agenda, all nonproletarian parties tend to go over to the other side; it is the mass of
      the supporters of these parties, especially in the intermediate strata, that can be won over by a victoriously
      advancing revolution. <em class="calibre8" id="ch11--371">This</em> pattern has been seen time and again in history.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch11--372">
      That this is the source of the confusion—the shifting of the question to the fate of parties, not people and
      class groups—becomes likely when we find that in later discussions Engels made this interpretation explicit more
      than once. For example, seven years later he criticized an article that advocated putschism and the old
      Jacobin-conspiratorial game as the proper response to Bismarck’s Anti-Socialist Law.<a class="calibre6" id="ch11en10-r"></a><a class="nounder1" href="43.html#ch11en10" id="ch11--374">*</a> He commented as follows on the
      writer’s ultraleftist conception of how a proletarian revolution takes place:
    </div>
<div class="bq" id="ch11--375">
      This [conception] at last is the dreamed-of realization of the phrase “one reactionary mass.” All the official
      parties united in one lump <em class="calibre8" id="ch11--376">here</em>, just like all the Socialists in one column <em class="calibre8" id="ch11--377">there</em>—great decisive battle; victory all along the line at one blow. In real life things do not
      happen so simply. In real life … the revolution begins the other way round, by the great majority of the people
      and also of the official parties rallying <em class="calibre8" id="ch11--378">against</em> the government, which is thereby
      isolated, and overthrowing it; and it is only after those of the official parties whose existence is still
      possible have mutually, jointly, and successively accomplished one another’s destruction that Vollmar’s great
      division takes place, bringing with it the last chance of our rule.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch11--379"><a class="calibre14" id="ch11fn56"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch11fn56-r" id="ch11--381">56</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="noindentt" id="ch11--382">
      It is quite clear that the “great division” that takes place even at the end is the polarization of <em class="calibre8" id="ch11--383">parties.</em> But a revolution can be successful only if the masses can be won away from the parties
      they followed. Engels concludes: “If, like Vollmar, we wanted to start straight off with the <em class="calibre8" id="ch11--384">final act</em> of the revolution, we should be in a terribly bad way.” In the “final act of the
      revolution” all other parties have exhausted their <a class="calibre6" id="page_315"></a>roles, and “we” can come to power
      precisely because a substantial section of the intermediate strata can be detached.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch11--386">
      The question cropped up again in 1891 when the “one reactionary mass” formula appeared in Kautsky’s draft for the
      Erfurt program of the German party. Engels wrote him about his “great astonishment” at once more seeing this
      “agitational” and “extremely one-sided phrase.” He objects to it even though it is a question of parties in “one
      reactionary mass.” The phrase should be thrown out because it takes a “historical tendency” and enunciates it as
      an “accomplished fact.”
    </div>
<div class="bq" id="ch11--387">
      The moment the social revolution starts, all other parties <em class="calibre8" id="ch11--388">appear</em> to be a reactionary
      mass vis-á-vis us. Possibly they already <em class="calibre8" id="ch11--389">are</em> such, have lost all capacity for any
      progressive action whatsoever, although not necessarily so. But at the <em class="calibre8" id="ch11--390">present moment</em> we
      cannot say so, at least not with the certainty with which we proclaim the other programmatic principles. Even in
      Germany conditions may arise under which the left parties, despite their miserableness, may be <em class="calibre8" id="ch11--391">forced</em> to sweep away part of the colossal antibourgeois, bureaucratic and feudal rubbish that is
      still lying there. And in that event they are simply no reactionary mass.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch11--392"><a class="calibre14" id="ch11fn57"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch11fn57-r" id="ch11--394">57</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="noindentt" id="ch11--395">
      And, continues Engels, if the proletariat is not yet ready to take power, the phrase is even more misleading,
      because it divides the nation into “a reactionary majority and an impotent minority.” He offers three relatively
      recent examples of reform work done by bourgeois parties to show the hollowness of characterizing all of them
      indiscriminately as “<em class="calibre8" id="ch11--396">one</em> reactionary mass.” The formula applies least of all to England:
    </div>
<div class="bq" id="ch11--397">
      … in England, for instance, this tendency will <em class="calibre8" id="ch11--398">never</em> become an absolutely complete fact.
      When the overturn comes here the bourgeoisie will still be ever ready for every manner of reform in detail. Only
      there is no longer any sense in insisting on reforming in detail a system that is being overthrown.
    </div>
<div class="noindentt" id="ch11--399">
      It was in Germany after the First World War, not in England, that history was going to show that the revolution
      could be defeated only because “one reactionary mass” did <em class="calibre8" id="ch11--400">not</em> exist, that is, because the
      leftmost bourgeois parties separated themselves from the reactionary right in order to absorb the impact of the
      crisis.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch11--401">
      “The Lassallean phrase,” concludes Engels, “is justified <em class="calibre8" id="ch11--402">under certain circumstances</em> in
      agitation, although with us it is enormously <a class="calibre6" id="page_316"></a>abused.”<sup class="calibre13" id="ch11--404"><a class="calibre14" id="ch11fn58"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch11fn58-r" id="ch11--406">58</a></sup> He does not indicate what
      the justificatory circumstances might be.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch11--407">
      In an 1895 letter about France, Engels seems to be thinking of the formula in terms of “a coalition of all the
      bourgeois parties against socialism, a mass which always forms at a time of danger and then dissolves again into
      its various and mutually opposed interest groups.”<sup class="calibre13" id="ch11--408"><a class="calibre14" id="ch11fn59"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch11fn59-r" id="ch11--410">59</a></sup> This makes it not a phenomenon of the “final act” but an
      on-and-off characteristic of the class struggle in general: an interpretation tending to empty it of any
      significant content. But the same letter goes on to agree that, on “the day of the crisis,” “we shall have a
      compact mass confronting us.” A compact mass of <em class="calibre8" id="ch11--411">parties?</em> We end with another ambiguity.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch11--412">
      In short, the Lassallean phrase—which hung on in the German movement as a bit of verbal bravado—was productive of
      nothing but confusion from its beginning to its end.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch11--413">
      Writing less than two months after the last-cited letter, in his 1895 introduction to Marx’s <em class="calibre8" id="ch11--414">Class Struggles in France</em>, Engels was concerned to emphasize a quite different side of the
      question. In the 1848 revolutions “all sections of the people” sympathized with the insurrections—“one
      revolutionary mass” in our previous phrase—but this “will hardly recur.” He warns against an overoptimistic
      illusion:
    </div>
<div class="bq" id="ch11--415">
      in the class struggle all the middle strata will probably never group themselves round the proletariat so
      exclusively that in comparison the party of reaction gathered round the bourgeoisie will well-nigh
      disappear.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch11--416"><a class="calibre14" id="ch11fn60"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch11fn60-r" id="ch11--418">60</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="indentt" id="ch11--419">
      It would have been better to advise dropping all talk of the sort exemplified by “one reactionary mass” and
      concentrate on the question of class alliances. When the above passage was written, Engels had just finished his
      most important programmatic article on a question of class alliance which could determine the fate of
      revolutions: socialist political policy with respect to the peasantry. To this question we now turn.
