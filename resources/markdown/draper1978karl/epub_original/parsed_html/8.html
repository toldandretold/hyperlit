<h2 class="h1" id="ch01"><a class="calibre4" id="page_17"></a>1 PATTERNS OF REVOLUTION</h2>
<div class="indent" id="ch01--2">
      By 1843-1844 Marx had come to look on the proletariat as the moving force of the coming revolution. By the
      writing of <em class="calibre8" id="ch01--3">The German Ideology</em> Marx and Engels were quite clear that the revolution they
      advocated was a <em class="calibre8" id="ch01--4">proletarian revolution.</em> What did this mean to them, and what did it entail?
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch01--5">
      They spent the rest of their lives answering these questions; and by the same token it will take the rest of this
      work to present their answers. But we can usefully start with some basic aspects of Marx’s developed conceptions,
      especially in the borderland between terminology and idea.
    </div>
<h3 class="h2" id="ch01lev1">1. REVOLUTION—SOCIAL AND POLITICAL</h3>
<div class="indent" id="ch01--7">
      The word <em class="calibre8" id="ch01--8">revolution</em> is most commonly used as either a bogy or a banality, depending on
      whether it is seen as a sinister plot or reduced to a mere synonym for change. When the word becomes respectable,
      as ferocious words do when coopted, then not only is every detergent advertised as “new and revolutionary,” but
      every new political device is advertised as in tune with some fashionable “revolution,” such as the Revolution of
      Rising Expectations. More seriously, the word is also used historically to denote deep-going social change, as
      when the medieval invention of the horse collar is called an economic revolution, or in such terms as the
      Industrial Revolution. This is not said to object to such usages, but to differentiate them from those
      encountered in the framework of Marx’s theory.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch01--9">
      In a more specific sense, a revolution is seen as a transfer of <a class="calibre6" id="page_18"></a>governmental power. But this
      still covers a host of ambiguities. Transfer of power from whom to whom, or from what to what? As popularly used,
      it may simply be a matter of a change in personnel: this set of colonels in the Government Palace instead of that
      set of politicians; the substitution of one clique or faction for another. The term is activated especially if
      directly forceful methods are used instead of constitutional forms. It may make no more difference than the
      substitution of one set of political manipulators for another by any other means—for example, by more or less
      corrupt elections, or even honest ones.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch01--11">
      The case becomes more interesting if one faction represents not merely a different set of pockets or Swiss bank
      accounts, but a different stratum or group interest—even if still within the ruling class. Marx’s analysis of
      Bonapartism brought up many examples of this. Or, as we also saw in that analysis, the new wielders of political
      power may represent not a different social stratum of the ruling class but merely a different political policy,
      with or without a different ideological orientation. Or, perhaps most likely of all, both may be true: a
      different social stratum acts as the bearer of a different policy or ideology. Certainly the historical tendency
      is toward such a combination. But history exhibits various permutations within these boundaries, the boundaries
      being set by the range of possibilities for a given social system and its ruling class.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch01--12">
      Within these boundaries, one very important type of difference may involve changes in political structure, in
      state forms. In modern history most of these cases involve shifts from more or less democratic state forms to
      antidemocratic ones (military dictatorship, fascism) or the other way round. It is such transformations in
      governmental forms that especially tend to get called revolutions. These are the most highly visible forms of
      transfers of governmental power. All of these involve political revolutions.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch01--13">
<em class="calibre8" id="ch01--14">Political</em> revolution, then, puts the emphasis on the changes in governmental leadership
      and forms, transformations in the superstructure. But if such a revolution involves a change in social stratum
      even within the ruling class, a social element is plainly entailed. Political revolutions run the gamut, from
      those involving almost no social side, to those with a very important social element, even if it is within the
      class boundaries we have assumed.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch01--15">
      If these social boundaries are burst by the impact of the change, then we have a different sort of revolution,
      which is of special importance <a class="calibre6" id="page_19"></a>to Marx’s theory. As Marx explained to a Cologne jury in 1849:
      the development of insoluble contradictions within the society “prepares the way for <em class="calibre8" id="ch01--17">social
      crises</em>, which burst out in <em class="calibre8" id="ch01--18">political revolutions</em>.”<sup class="calibre13" id="ch01--19"><a class="calibre14" id="ch01fn1"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch01fn1-r" id="ch01--21">1</a></sup> The outcome is a revolution
      involving the transference of political power to a new class; and this change in ruling class tends to entail a
      basic change in the social system (mode of production). It is this kind of revolution which is most properly
      called a <em class="calibre8" id="ch01--22">social</em> revolution.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch01--23">
      Unfortunately this does not end the terminological problem, as we weave our way through the voluminous literature
      that talks about revolution. If we decide to define social revolution as a basic transformation in the social
      system involving its class base, then it is apparent that such a sweeping change cannot be conceived as a mere
      act or event, but as a process, more or less extended in time. The transformation from capitalism to socialism is
      envisaged by Marx as such a historical process (as we shall see in Volume 4). Moreover, it is clear that in some
      cases in the past, social systems have changed basically, and classes have risen and fallen, in a secular
      movement of history which can be described as a social revolution—at least in historical retrospect, even though
      no one may have been aware that a revolution was going on.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch01--24">
      It would be convenient if such a long-term or secular transformation in society, however achieved, had a tag of
      its own, so that one could discuss its relationship to other things called revolutions. There is no such
      agreed-on label; we must take the desperate recourse of inventing one. Let us call this a <em class="calibre8" id="ch01--25">societal revolution</em>, meaning that it denotes a change from one type of society to another,
      keeping in mind that for Marx’s theory a society is not simply a cultural but a socioeconomic whole.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch01--26">
      We can now narrow our focus to what tends to be called a social revolution in Marx’s theory. It is most clearly
      used for a political revolution that expresses a social-revolutionizing drive toward the transference of state
      power to a new class. It is “a political revolution with a social soul,” in Marx’s earliest (1844)
      formulation.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch01--27"><a class="calibre14" id="ch01fn2"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch01fn2-r" id="ch01--29">2</a></sup> By the same token it points in the direction of a societal revolution, regardless
      of when changes in the social system actually begin to take place. It does this by establishing a new
      constellation of sociopolitical forces, with new historic potentialities. The societal revolution is the
      realization of these potentialities. “Every real revolution,” wrote Engels, “is a social one, in that it brings a
      new class to power and allows it to remodel society in its own image.”<sup class="calibre13" id="ch01--30"><a class="calibre14" id="ch01fn3"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch01fn3-r" id="ch01--32">3</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="indent" id="ch01--33">
<a class="calibre6" id="page_20"></a>Our aim is not to make a hard-and-fast distinction between political revolutions and social
      revolutions but, if anything, the reverse: to recognize how often they are mingled in given revolutionary
      situations, so that the two elements must be distinguished by analysis. For, especially in modern times,
      revolutionary events tend to blend both in varying proportions. The purely political revolution, involving a
      change in factions only, is likely to be a mere palace revolution, that is, one in which the upset takes place
      only on top without drawing in any sector of the people as actors on the scene. It is increasingly limited to
      socially backward areas. The modern tendency is for political revolution, however narrowly initiated, to waken
      the elements of social revolution from dormancy or to raise them to new levels. Thus the relationship between
      political and social revolution is not static. All this has been true of bourgeois revolutions since the first
      stirrings of the bourgeoisie, and it will provide important background for our chapters on that subject
      (<a class="nounder1" href="15.html#ch07" id="ch01--35">Chapters 7</a>-<a class="nounder1" href="18.html#ch10" id="ch01--36">10</a> below). In terms of Marx’s development, it was the revolution of 1848-1849 that was the
      proving ground.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch01--37">
      For Marx, then, revolution is defined by the nature of the change involved, by sociopolitical relations. In the
      popular mind, where “the ruling ideas are the ideas of the ruling class,” and therefore in journalistic terms,
      revolution and revolutionary developments are seen primarily in terms of particular means: force and violence, as
      departures from the political methods prescribed by the established powers. We shall devote considerable
      attention, in Volume 3, to Marx’s conception of the relationship between social revolution and the means to
      effect it; suffice to say that the relationship emerges from a social historical analysis—it is not one of
      definition. Just as revolutionary change obviously did not always involve violent action ipso facto, so also
      violent outbreaks are by no means necessarily revolutionary, even if this term is stretched to include
      counterrevolutionary. Time and again, right up to today, it has taken violent methods (“revolutionary” actions in
      the eyes of the status quo) to gain simple reforms. Indeed, political revolution (of some limited sort) is not a
      rare road to social reforms. A related conception identifies revolution with the technique of the coup d’état:
      revolution suggests seizing the radio station, telephone exchange, local Winter Palace, and so on. This crude
      myth was by no means invented by Hollywood, which took it over from the respectable literature where it was
      already entrenched.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch01--38">
<a class="calibre6" id="page_21"></a>These ruling ideas about revolution are typically bourgeois conceptions, class-conditioned
      distortions of the social reality. They represent the other side of the coin of a ruling class’s built-in dread
      of revolutionary violence, on the one hand, and on the other, its unwillingness and inability to conceive of
      revolution as a social upheaval from below. A putsch by an armed gang is something it can handle, and also
      something it can dismiss as banditry or pathology; in neither case need it face the social reality of mass
      revolution, which often comes as a surprise. The definition of revolution in terms of means (violent, illegal) is
      a characteristic of bourgeois ideology just as much as its opposite, namely, the insistence that social change
      must be limited to nonviolent means. This bourgeois approach provides a spectrum from the most pacifistic reform
      to the most violent putschism; and no part of it has anything to do with Marx’s theory, which stands outside of
      this obsession with the dichotomy of violence or nonviolence.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch01--40">
      The revolution that concerns Marx is defined by the nature of the social change it entails, by the class
      relationships in that change. It is a political revolution which is the immediate manifestation of a social
      revolution.
    </div>
<h3 class="h2" id="ch01lev2">2. CLASS POLITICAL POWER</h3>
<div class="indent" id="ch01--42">
      Proletarian revolution is, then, a short form for proletarian social revolution—transference of state power to a
      new ruling class, the proletariat.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch01--43">
      This raises the problem of the class nature of the new political power. In principle this problem is no different
      from that of analyzing the class nature of any other political institutions, including those of the established
      society; this is what we discussed under the head of the theory of the state, in Volume 1. The difference is that
      in a revolutionary context everything is in flux, and does not meekly stand still for leisurely examination. The
      difficulties thus created are immense.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch01--44">
      Marx offered no political formulas on this subject, nor could he do so. The totality of a social (class) analysis
      is at stake. Marx had to take up more than once the nature of given political movements that aspired to power or
      were moving to seize it. He had to analyze stated declarations, <a class="calibre6" id="page_22"></a>claimed intentions,
      programmatic documents, articulated ideologies and unarticulated biases, the correspondence of word and deed,
      objective socioeconomic linkages, and everything else bearing on the totality of the class configuration, not
      only at a given moment but over a period of experience. This refers us back to the social theory on which
      politics (including Marx’s politics) is based. Working this problem out in a concrete case tests a theory of
      society’s laws of motion.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch01--46">
      The <em class="calibre8" id="ch01--47">Communist Manifesto</em> raised this problem in a discussion of what it called feudal
      socialism. Its interest lies in this: it identifies a type of “socialism” which conceals its real class character
      behind an appeal to the proletariat’s interests:
    </div>
<div class="bqi1" id="ch01--48">
      Owing to their historical position, it became the vocation of the aristocracies of France and England to write
      pamphlets against modern bourgeois society….
    </div>
<div class="bqi2" id="ch01--49">
      In order to arouse sympathy, the aristocracy were obliged to lose sight, apparently, of their own interests, and
      to formulate their indictment against the bourgeoisie in the interest of the exploited working class alone …
    </div>
<div class="bqi2" id="ch01--50">
      In this way arose feudal Socialism … half echo of the past, half menace of the future; at times, by its bitter,
      witty and incisive criticism, striking the bourgeoisie to the very heart’s core; but always ludicrous in its
      effect, through total incapacity to comprehend the march of modern history.
    </div>
<div class="bq1" id="ch01--51">
      The problem of exposure is first solved with a flourish:
    </div>
<div class="bqi1" id="ch01--52">
      The aristocracy, in order to rally the people to them, waved the proletarian alms-bag in front for a banner. But
      the people, so often as it joined them, saw on their hindquarters the old feudal coats of arms,<a class="calibre6" id="ch01en1-r"></a><a class="nounder1" href="43.html#ch01en1" id="ch01--54">*</a> and deserted with loud and
      irreverent laughter.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch01--55"><a class="calibre14" id="ch01fn4"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch01fn4-r" id="ch01--57">4</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="noindentt" id="ch01--58">
      But the section ends with a more concrete sociopolitical analysis of <a class="calibre6" id="page_23"></a>what betrays feudal
      socialism as antiproletarian. More important, we shall see in <a class="nounder1" href="17.html#ch09" id="ch01--60">Chapter 9</a> below that Marx and Engels did in fact have to write a great deal more to analyze
      the nature of this alien socialism—alien to the proletariat as a class.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch01--61">
      But analysis does not end the matter; the proof of the pudding is in the eating; the class nature of revolution
      is tested by what the new class in power does. Social revolution means that the new class in power does not limit
      itself to change within the framework of the old social system, but tends to put its new state power into basic
      conflict with the former ruling strata. And the conflict must be resolved more or less quickly in favor of the
      new or the old; the new political power must proceed to revolutionize the socioeconomic foundation, or else it
      will be destroyed by the rooted power of the latter. In either case, by revolution or counterrevolution,
      congruence will eventually be reestablished between the political and socioeconomic institutions.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch01--62">
      The conflict may be seen by both sides only in embryo. This is what happened when, four months after the February
      revolution of 1848, the Paris workers rose up against the new republican regime. In the midst of these June Days,
      Marx wrote about the difference:
    </div>
<div class="bqi" id="ch01--63">
      None of the innumerable revolutions of the French bourgeoisie since 1789 was an assault on <em class="calibre8" id="ch01--64">order</em>, for they left standing class rule, the slavery of the workers, the <em class="calibre8" id="ch01--65">bourgeois order</em>, no matter how often the political form of this rule and this slavery changed.
      June has impugned this <em class="calibre8" id="ch01--66">order.</em> Woe to June!<sup class="calibre13" id="ch01--67"><a class="calibre14" id="ch01fn5"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch01fn5-r" id="ch01--69">5</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="indent" id="ch01--70">
      Marx had to make this analysis in the flux of struggle. After all, the problem of the class nature of a new or
      aspiring political power does not exist only for uninvolved observers or distant historians. The problem is
      itself part of the political and social struggle going on, and it may not be resolvable by theory but only in the
      course of the struggle itself. The ongoing struggle, especially in critical phases, provides tests—tests of who
      represents what. Part of the struggle is on convincing the proletariat not only of who represents what (passive
      formulation) but of whom to act through and with. It is not merely a matter of registering a verdict post hoc.
    </div>
<h3 class="h2" id="ch01lev3"><a class="calibre15" id="page_24"></a>3. THE GUIDING AIM OF REVOLUTION</h3>
<div class="indent" id="ch01--73">
      It is insufficiently appreciated that, from early on, Marx and Engels habitually stated their political aim not
      in terms of a desired change in social system (socialism) but in terms of a change in class power (proletarian
      rule).
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch01--74">
      The two could not be assumed to be synonymous. The aim of proletarian rule, to be sure, commonly assumed
      socialism or communism as the corresponding societal form; but the reverse by no means worked automatically. Marx
      and Engels took as their governing aim not the aspiration for a certain type of future society, but the position
      of a social class as an embodiment of humanity’s interests; not an abstract ideology of change (socialist ideas)
      but a class-conditioned perspective, what they called the proletarian outlook. In this context, the term <em class="calibre8" id="ch01--75">proletarian outlook</em> does not mean the outlook of a proletariat taken statically (for there is no
      such single outlook) but rather the outlook on society corresponding to the basic interests of the proletariat.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch01--76">
      After Marx’s initial period of exploration in 1843-1844,<sup class="calibre13" id="ch01--77"><a class="calibre14" id="ch01fn6"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch01fn6-r" id="ch01--79">6</a></sup> the joint view of Marx and Engels on this issue was clearly
      stated in <em class="calibre8" id="ch01--80">The German Ideology.</em> Struggles over political forms, “all struggles within the
      state, the struggle between democracy, aristocracy, and monarchy, the struggle for the franchise, etc., etc., are
      merely the illusory forms … in which the real struggles of the different classes are fought out among one
      another.”
    </div>
<div class="bq" id="ch01--81">
      Further, it follows that every class which is striving for dominance, even when its dominance, as is the case
      with the proletariat, presupposes the abolition of the old form of society in its entirety and of domination in
      general, must first conquer political power in order to represent its interest in turn as the general interest
      [of society], which in the first moment it is forced to do.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch01--82"><a class="calibre14" id="ch01fn7"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch01fn7-r" id="ch01--84">7</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="noindent" id="ch01--85">
      Behind the ideology of change is the class representing change: “The existence of revolutionary ideas in a
      particular period presupposes the existence of a revolutionary class …”<sup class="calibre13" id="ch01--86"><a class="calibre14" id="ch01fn8"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch01fn8-r" id="ch01--88">8</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="indent" id="ch01--89">
      This emphasis in <em class="calibre8" id="ch01--90">The German Ideology</em> is tied up closely with the view of the revolution
      not simply as a certain transformation of society but above all as a transformation of people. Socialism as the
      “revolution in humankind” (which will be discussed in Volume 4) was not an afterthought for Marx but the
      conception with which he began.
    </div>
<div class="bq" id="ch01--91">
<a class="calibre6" id="page_25"></a>Only the proletarians of the present day, who are completely shut off from all self-activity,
      are in a position to achieve a complete and no longer restricted self-activity, which consists in the
      appropriation of a totality of productive forces and in the development of a totality of capacities entailed by
      this.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch01--93"><a class="calibre14" id="ch01fn9"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch01fn9-r" id="ch01--95">9</a></sup>

<div class="noindent" id="ch01--96">
      The socioeconomic arrangement (socialism) was the means; the revolutionary target was something else, which
      merely required socialism:
    </div>
<div class="bq" id="ch01--97">
      In all appropriations up to now, a mass of individuals remained subservient to a single instrument of production;
      in the appropriation by the proletarians, a mass of instruments of production must be made subject to each
      individual, and property to all. Modern universal intercourse cannot be controlled by individuals unless it is
      controlled by all.
    </div>
<div class="noindent" id="ch01--98">
      The revolution changes people, not simply by its ultimate effects, but in its course:
    </div>
<div class="bqi" id="ch01--99">
      This appropriation [as described above] is further determined by the manner in which it must be effected. It can
      only be effected through a union which by the character of the proletariat itself can again only be a universal
      one, and through a revolution in which, on the one hand, the power of the earlier mode of production and
      intercourse and social organization is overthrown and, on the other hand, there develops the universal character
      and the energy of the proletariat, which are required to accomplish the appropriation, and the proletariat
      moreover rids itself of everything that still clings to it from its previous position in society.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch01--100"><a class="calibre14" id="ch01fn10"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch01fn10-r" id="ch01--102">10</a></sup>

<div class="indent" id="ch01--103">
      In this whole passage Marx has his eye on what the revolution means for humankind. He proceeds to discuss what
      the philosophers have meant by <em class="calibre8" id="ch01--104">der Mensch</em> as a social abstraction, how they substituted
      this social abstraction for the actual individuals of given social classes, and thus transformed history into a
      “process of consciousness” instead of a development of class-conditioned social entities. By ignoring the
      individuals’ subjection to the distortions of class society (the division of labor), the philosophers worked a
      sleight-of-hand: “the average individual of the later stage was always foisted on to the earlier stage, and the
      consciousness of a later age on to the individuals of an earlier.”<sup class="calibre13" id="ch01--105"><a class="calibre14" id="ch01fn11"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch01fn11-r" id="ch01--107">11</a></sup> This later stage, or age,

      The same priority was embodied in the basic statements of the <em class="calibre8" id="ch01--115">Communist Manifesto:</em>
</div>
<div class="bq" id="ch01--116">
      If the proletariat during its contest with the bourgeoisie is compelled, by the force of circumstances, to
      organize itself as a class; if, by means of a revolution, it makes itself the ruling class, and, as such, sweeps
      away by force the old conditions of production, then it will, along with these conditions, have swept away the
      conditions for the existence of class antagonisms and of classes generally, and will thereby have abolished its
      own supremacy as a class.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch01--117"><a class="calibre14" id="ch01fn13"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch01fn13-r" id="ch01--119">13</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="indent" id="ch01--120">
      Thirty-five years later Engels referred back to this passage in a letter giving a summary statement of the aims
      of revolution, in which, as usual, he states the “ends of the social revolution of the future” in terms of
      proletarian power; the matter of socialist reorganization of society is not even mentioned, though
      assumed.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch01--121"><a class="calibre14" id="ch01fn14"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch01fn14-r" id="ch01--123">14</a></sup> There is no question of counterposing one to the other; it is the governing
      priority which is exhibited. Elsewhere he would couple the two, while maintaining the same order:
    </div>
<div class="bqi" id="ch01--124">
      The revolution which modern socialism strives to achieve is, briefly, the victory of the proletariat over the
      bourgeoisie, and the establishment of a new organization of society by the destruction of all class
      distinction.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch01--125"><a class="calibre14" id="ch01fn15"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch01fn15-r" id="ch01--127">15</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="indent" id="ch01--128">
      The point can perhaps be sharpened by posing an occasionally mooted question: what is it that <em class="calibre8" id="ch01--129">defines</em> the crux of Marxism? The problem has been pointed up by the fact that one or another
      Marxist has rejected this or that theory of Marx’s, say, “dialectical materialism,” or the labor theory of value.
      There can be little doubt about the answer given by Marx and Engels, and it would not be pitched in terms <a class="calibre6" id="page_27"></a>of a set of ideas.<a class="calibre6" id="ch01en2-r"></a><a class="nounder1" href="43.html#ch01en2" id="ch01--132">*</a> Their ism must be basically defined, in terms of class power, as <em class="calibre8" id="ch01--133">the
      theory and practice of the proletarian revolution.</em>
</div>
<div class="indent" id="ch01--134">
      In point of fact, both Marx and Engels seldom raised a question in terms of definition. One case in which Engels
      did this occurred in 1846, shortly after the completion of <em class="calibre8" id="ch01--135">The German Ideology.</em> He
      described in a letter his debates with the followers of True-Socialism in a German workers’ club in Paris:
    </div>
<div class="bq" id="ch01--136">
      I therefore defined the objectives of the Communists in this way: (1) to achieve the interests of the proletariat
      in opposition to those of the bourgeoisie; (2) to do this through the abolition of private property and its
      replacement by community of goods; (3) to recognize no means of carrying out these objectives other than a
      democratic revolution by force.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch01--137"><a class="calibre14" id="ch01fn19"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch01fn19-r" id="ch01--139">19</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="indent" id="ch01--140">
      The order of priority goes to the heart of the matter in the following sense. Before and after Marx, most
      varieties of socialism or communism defined themselves in terms of a desired transformation in socioeconomic
      organization, and adopted a working-class orientation (if they did so at all) in order to effectuate this
      program.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch01--141"><a class="calibre14" id="ch01fn20"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch01fn20-r" id="ch01--143">20</a></sup> For Marx, this relationship of means and ends was reversed. The revolutionary
      program is defined in terms of a new class ascendancy; the need for a reorganization of society is the
      consequence. While Marx’s well-known reluctance to concern himself with the forms of future socialist society has
      been ascribed to an overreaction against utopianism, a contributing element is the fact that it is not the form
      of organization of future society that is in the center of his theory of revolution.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch01--144">
      There is still another aspect of this question of priority. From Marx’s standpoint, what made his theory
      revolutionary was that it looked to a literal <em class="calibre8" id="ch01--145">overturning:</em> not simply an overthrow, the
      deposition of established power, but a turning-over of the social corpus itself, as “the lowest stratum of our
      present society” stirs, heaves up, with “the whole superincumbent strata of official society being sprung into
      the air,” as <a class="calibre6" id="page_28"></a>the Manifesto pictured it vividly. This is the revolution; the revolution is not
      the adoption of a certain social schema. It was only the revolution of the exploited majority that could do this,
      in Marx’s view; therefore the revolution from below had to be a proletarian revolution, and the proletarian
      ascendancy to power had to be a revolution from below.
    </div>
<h3 class="h2" id="ch01lev4">4. PROLETARIAN AND BOURGEOIS REVOLUTION</h3>
<div class="indent" id="ch01--148">
      In presenting the proletariat as the ruling class to be, Marx often stressed that in this respect the proletariat
      would only be doing what other classes had done before it throughout the history of the world. Most explicit was
      an analogy with the bourgeoisie, which also dominated a historic era by its struggle for the conquest of
      political power. The bourgeois revolution was the social revolution of the past, the proletarian revolution is
      the social revolution of the future: this is a common note. In both cases, a lower class organizes itself
      politically to conquer state power.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch01--149">
      But the analogy between bourgeois and proletarian revolution holds only up to a point, like most analogies. The
      differences in the classes entail equally basic differences in the revolutions they bear. Some of these
      differences will best be discussed under other heads, especially differences in perspective (abolition of classes
      and state, for example). Here let us note three that are of immediate consequence for the course of the
      revolution itself.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch01--150">
      The first two are already set forth in the <em class="calibre8" id="ch01--151">Communist Manifesto.</em>
</div>
<div class="indent" id="ch01--152">
      (1) All previous revolutions have been in the interest of one form of private property over another form of
      private property. The proletarian revolution breaks out of this cycle, for it is the revolution of a propertyless
      class. The Manifesto puts it this way:
    </div>
<div class="bqi" id="ch01--153">
      All the preceding classes that got the upper hand sought to fortify their acquired status by subjecting society
      at large to their conditions of appropriation. The proletarians cannot become masters of the productive forces of
      society except by abolishing their own previous mode of appropriation, and thereby also every other previous mode
      of appropriation. They have nothing of their <a class="calibre6" id="page_29"></a>own to secure and to fortify; their mission is
      to destroy all previous securities for, and insurances of, individual property.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch01--155"><a class="calibre14" id="ch01fn21"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch01fn21-r" id="ch01--157">21</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="indent" id="ch01--158">
      This fact is of enormous moment not simply for the aims of the revolution but for its accomplishment. For one
      thing, as we have seen, the bourgeois revolution had the advantage of offering the deposed ruling class a new
      lease on property-holding life, even if on less advantageous terms.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch01--159"><a class="calibre14" id="ch01fn22"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch01fn22-r" id="ch01--161">22</a></sup> This was a factor in
      blunting the bitterness of defeat as well as in infiltrating the enemy. The proletariat has nothing of this sort
      to offer.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch01--162">
      (2) The proletarian revolution differs from the bourgeois in that it proposes to put political power in the
      hands, not of another minority class to exploit the producers in a new way, but of a class representing the
      exploited majority. This was strongly stated in the Manifesto as part of the “upheaval from below” aspect
      stressed in the preceding section:
    </div>
<div class="bqi" id="ch01--163">
      All previous [historical]<a class="calibre6" id="ch01en3-r"></a><a class="nounder1" href="43.html#ch01en3" id="ch01--165">*</a>
      movements were movements of minorities, or in the interest of minorities. The proletarian movement is the
      [self-conscious] <a class="calibre6" id="ch01en4-r"></a><a class="nounder1" href="43.html#ch01en4" id="ch01--167">*</a> independent
      movement of the immense majority, in the interest of the immense majority. The proletariat, the lowest stratum of
      our present society, cannot stir, cannot raise itself up, without the whole superincumbent strata of official
      society being sprung into the air.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch01--168"><a class="calibre14" id="ch01fn24"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch01fn24-r" id="ch01--170">24</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="indent" id="ch01--171">
      These two differences will also be important in connection with the perspective of abolishing classes and the
      state.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch01--172">
      (3) The third difference is partly an outgrowth of the first. The bourgeoisie, a property-owning class, was able
      to build up its social relations gradually within the womb of feudal society and to attain effective control of
      economic power within the framework of the old society, before it was able to take political power and change the
      class nature of the state. Its economic power developed with the inevitability of gradualness (this is where the
      phrase applies)—even with the aid of the still feudal or absolutist state. The latter not only could not resist
      this process but was compelled to desire it. Secure in their economic power, the bourgeois could use this
      position of strength as a fortress from which to press further toward the acquisition of decisive political
      power.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch01--173">
      If any class was ever in a position to bring about its transformation <a class="calibre6" id="page_30"></a>of society gradually
      and without upheavals, it was certainly the bourgeoisie. But history shows us that this process had its limits in
      the sphere of political power. Within the old state, the bourgeoisie was certainly able to achieve considerable
      quantitative increase in political weight (political “power” in the colloquial sense of influence), but the state
      continued to be basically controlled by an alien (prebourgeois) class force which merely bent to the new
      pressure. The old ruling classes did not release their death-clutch on the state levers except after a definite
      period of political revolutionary action, which unblocked the development of the bourgeois social transformation.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch01--175">
      The proletariat cannot emulate this pattern, because it differs basically from previous ruling classes in that it
      is not a property-owning class; in fact it develops as a class insofar as the producers are separated from
      ownership of means of production. The proletariat cannot build up a class economic power within the shell of
      capitalist society, as a prelude to overwhelming that society by its economic strength, in some fashion
      comparable to the pattern of bourgeois revolution.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch01--176">
      Some contrary conceptions, looking to the rise of a proletarian “economic power” of some sort within the womb of
      bourgeois society, will concern us in Volume 3 in connection with socialist reformism. Here let us mention three
      aspects of the problem in order to highlight it. (1) Individual workers may own property—a home, for example, not
      to speak of clothes and toothbrush—but these are items of personal property of which they are the direct
      consumers; these things are not the private property which functions as means of production in the economic power
      structure. All the worker-owned homes in the country give the proletariat no economic leverage in the system and
      no political leverage of social significance. (2) It was once believed in some reform circles that the
      organization of cooperatives provided a proletarian analogue to the bourgeois experience; and Marx had to argue
      against this as an illusion.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch01--177"><a class="calibre14" id="ch01fn25"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch01fn25-r" id="ch01--179">25</a></sup> This tendency has almost disappeared today even as a type of socialist
      reformism; for one thing, producers’ cooperatives have failed to develop in the fashion predicted. (3) Another
      sense in which a sort of proletarian economic power has been seen as growing up within the womb of capitalism, to
      eventually take it over, is the view that trade-unionism has this historic role. This often plays on the
      colloquial use of economic power that has been mentioned: it is influence or pressure that is meant, the need to
      be reckoned with, not <a class="calibre6" id="page_31"></a>the institutionalized power of property.<a class="nounder1" href="43.html#ch01en1" id="ch01--181">*</a> Trade-unionism is a modern form of the same economic power that every
      exploited class has had in history: the power to threaten by its struggle the revenues and perquisites of the
      possessing classes and thereby to obtain concessions. The view that sees trade-unionism literally as the
      womb-form of socialism is <em class="calibre8" id="ch01--182">classical syndicalism</em>, which will be touched on in the last
      section of <a class="nounder1" href="12.html#ch05" id="ch01--183">Chapter 5</a> below.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch01--184">
      In sum: for Marx, the working class (unlike the bourgeoisie) cannot inseminate its own system of economic power
      within the old one, thereby establishing a plateau of power from which to gain the political heights. The order
      necessarily is the reverse. The proletariat—through the organization of its political movement, like every other
      aspiring class—must first conquer political power and then begin the process of socioeconomic transformation. For
      the bourgeoisie, political power was finally plucked as the ripe or overripe fruit of its socioeconomic power,
      its power as a possessing class. For the proletariat, political power is needed as the engine with which to bring
      a new social order into existence.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch01--185">
      As a consequence of the comparison between bourgeois and proletarian revolution, the question has been mooted:
      which one is “easier”? Marx has made remarks on both sides of this question, with dubious applicability. In
      <em class="calibre8" id="ch01--186">The Eighteenth Brumaire</em> he has an explicit comparison, although by bourgeois revolutions
      he really has 1789 in mind, and by proletarian revolutions, or “the revolution of the nineteenth century,” he has
      the June 1848 uprising in Paris before him.
    </div>
<div class="bqi" id="ch01--187">
      The social revolution of the nineteenth century cannot draw its poetry from the past, but only from the future.
      It cannot begin with itself before it has stripped off all superstition in regard to the past. Earlier
      revolutions required recollections of past world history in order to drug themselves concerning their own
      content. In order to arrive at its own content, the revolution of the nineteenth century must let the dead bury
      their dead. There the phrase went beyond the content; here the content goes beyond the phrase.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch01--188"><a class="calibre14" id="ch01fn26"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch01fn26-r" id="ch01--190">26</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="noindent" id="ch01--191">
      This may be taken as a warning against imitation of past patterns on the <a class="calibre6" id="page_32"></a>ground of sheer
      analogy or in sheer parroting of watchwords and formulas. Marx goes on to this:
    </div>
<div class="bqi" id="ch01--193">
      Bourgeois revolutions, like those of the eighteenth century, storm swiftly from success to success; their
      dramatic effects outdo each other; men and things seem set in sparkling brilliants; ecstasy is the everyday
      spirit; but they are short-lived; soon they have attained their zenith, and a long crapulent depression lays hold
      of society before it learns soberly to assimilate the results of its storm-and-stress period. On the other hand,
      proletarian revolutions, like those of the nineteenth century, criticize themselves constantly, interrupt
      themselves continually in their own course, come back to the apparently accomplished in order to begin it afresh,
      deride with unmerciful thoroughness the inadequacies, weaknesses and paltrinesses of their first attempts, seem
      to throw down their adversary only in order that he may draw new strength from the earth and rise again, more
      gigantic, before them, recoil ever and anon from the indefinite prodigiousness of their own aims, until a
      situation has been created which makes all turning back impossible, and the conditions themselves cry out:
      <em class="calibre8" id="ch01--194">Hic Rhodus</em>, <em class="calibre8" id="ch01--195">hic salta!</em> Here is the rose, here dance!<sup class="calibre13" id="ch01--196"><a class="calibre14" id="ch01fn27"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch01fn27-r" id="ch01--198">27</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="noindent" id="ch01--199">
      This is an interesting résumé of revolutionary patterns, but the flat counterposition of bourgeois and
      proletarian revolutions with respect to these patterns is not as historically general as the language implies.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch01--200">
      In <em class="calibre8" id="ch01--201">Capital</em> Marx emphasizes an advantageous aspect of the change to socialism:
    </div>
<div class="bqi2" id="ch01--202">
      The transformation of scattered private property, arising from individual labor, into capitalist private property
      is, naturally, a process incomparably more protracted, violent, and difficult than the transformation of
      capitalistic private property, already practically resting on socialized production, into socialized property. In
      the former case, we had the expropriation of the mass of the people by a few usurpers; in the latter, we have the
      expropriation of a few usurpers by the mass of people.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch01--203"><a class="calibre14" id="ch01fn28"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch01fn28-r" id="ch01--205">28</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="indentt" id="ch01--206">
      There are obviously things to be said on both sides of the calculus of difficulty, if that rather unprofitable
      enterprise is undertaken. The important point for present purposes is simply the fact of difference itself. The
      luring analogies between bourgeois and proletarian revolutions, or among all revolutions for that matter, are not
      without interest; but in the last analysis the patterns of proletarian revolution are as unique as the class it
      reflects.
