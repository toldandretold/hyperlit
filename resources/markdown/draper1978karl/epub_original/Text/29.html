<div class="indentb" id="notea--5">
      One way of dismissing the problem of proletarian revolution, or at least of proletarian class struggle, has
      traditionally been to do away with the proletariat—to “vanish” it, as magicians say. This prestidigitation has
      been going on since the early nineteenth century, that is, virtually since the rise of the modern proletariat. It
      reached the status of a movement ideology with the vogue of Technocracy several decades ago. In 1933 Stuart Chase
      announced portentously:
    </div>
<div class="bqi" id="notea--6">
      The automatic process continually displaces the manual worker.… What becomes of the class struggle theory? Where
      are the toiling masses, without a worker in the plant? … The official labor movement, it is significant to note,
      has not progressed in the new mass production industries, and in the next phase, the automatic industry, there
      will be nobody to organize. When this development proceeds to a certain point, which we may or may not have
      reached, the whole Marxian thesis stands in need of substantial revision.<sup class="calibre13" id="notea--7"><a class="calibre14" id="noteafn1"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#noteafn1-r" id="notea--9">1</a></sup>

      This was published not long before the explosive rise of the CIO, centered in the mass-production industries,
      transformed the American labor movement and initiated a period of intensified class struggle. Since then, the
      news that the proletariat has virtually ceased to exist has come regularly from other prophets, the latest wave
      following hard on the escalation of the term <em class="calibre8" id="notea--11">automation</em> into <em class="calibre8" id="notea--12">cybernation.</em>
</div>
<div class="indent" id="notea--13">
      This note is not the place to take up the twentieth-century form of the myth about the disappearance of the
      proletariat, especially since this myth has been given its just deserts in excellent studies of the
      question.<sup class="calibre13" id="notea--14"><a class="calibre14" id="noteafn2"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#noteafn2-r" id="notea--16">2</a></sup> What faced Marx was not any claim that the process was taking place but merely
      the prediction that it would eventually take place <em class="calibre8" id="notea--17">under capitalism.</em>
</div>
<div class="indent" id="notea--18">
      The issue was already well known before Marx read his first book on <a class="calibre6" id="page_576"></a>economics; he noted it
      in his first manuscript on political economy, and he gave the essential answer in his first lecture on the
      subject.
    </div>
<div class="indentb" id="notea--20">
      In one of the early works of modern political economy, in 1819, Sismondi had remarked of English manufactures
      that “In fact, nothing remains to be desired but that the King, living quite alone on the island, should by
      continuously turning a crank cause automatons [<em class="calibre8" id="notea--21">des automates</em>] to do all the work of
      England.” Marx quoted this in his Paris manuscripts of 1844, without direct comment.<sup class="calibre13" id="notea--22"><a class="calibre14" id="noteafn3"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#noteafn3-r" id="notea--24">3</a></sup> The idea appeared also in
      the main work by Andrew Ure, the apologist for the factory system, and was quoted therefrom by Marx in his 1847
      work against Proudhon: “on the automatic plan,” wrote Ure, “skilled labour gets progressively superseded, and
      will, eventually, be replaced by mere onlookers of machines.”<sup class="calibre13" id="notea--25"><a class="calibre14" id="noteafn4"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#noteafn4-r" id="notea--27">4</a></sup> The same year, in lectures later published as
      <em class="calibre8" id="notea--28">Wage-Labor and Capital</em>, Marx answered:
    </div>
<div class="bq" id="notea--29">
      If the whole class of wage-workers were to be abolished owing to machinery, how dreadful that would be for
      capital which, without wage-labor, ceases to be capital!<sup class="calibre13" id="notea--30"><a class="calibre14" id="noteafn5"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#noteafn5-r" id="notea--32">5</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="noindentt" id="notea--33">
      For one thing, while there is no doubt that automatic machinery can produce commodities with a minimum of human
      labor, the machines are not programmed to buy their own products and consume them. In short, while this tendency
      appears early in capitalism, it cannot work itself out to the predicted end without bursting the bounds of that
      system.
    </div>
<div class="indentb" id="notea--34">
      Marx grapples with the issue in his <em class="calibre8" id="notea--35">Grundrisse</em> notebooks of 1857–1858,<a class="calibre6" id="noteaen1-r"></a><a class="nounder1" href="43.html#noteaen1" id="notea--37">*</a> where another passage from Ure
      is taken as text. Ure was defining the factory: “This term, in its strictest sense, involves the idea of a vast
      automaton, composed of numerous <em class="calibre8" id="notea--38">mechanical and intellectual organs</em> operating together and
      without interruption to produce one and the same object, all of these organs being subordinated to a motive force
      which moves by itself.”<sup class="calibre13" id="notea--39"><a class="calibre14" id="noteafn6"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#noteafn6-r" id="notea--41">6</a></sup> Marx accepts, and even emphasizes, that it is indeed the tendency of capital to
      move toward the minimization and eventual virtual elimination of human labor. From its start capital devaluates
      the old craftsman’s concern for skill and quality, and substitutes production for quantity, mass production,
      because it is interested only in exchange value and surplus value.
    </div>
<div class="bq" id="notea--42">
      The developed principle of capital is indeed to make special skill superfluous, and to make manual labor,
      directly physical labor in <a class="calibre6" id="page_577"></a>general, superfluous, as skilled labor as well as muscular
      exertion; instead, to put the skill into the dead forces of nature.<sup class="calibre13" id="notea--44"><a class="calibre14" id="noteafn7"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#noteafn7-r" id="notea--46">7</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="noindenttb" id="notea--47">
      This is a <em class="calibre8" id="notea--48">tendency</em> under capitalism; how far it develops into realization is another
      matter. In any case, the tendency toward automation is built into capitalism:
    </div>
<div class="bq" id="notea--49">
      Once involved in the production process of capital, however, the means of labor goes through various
      metamorphoses, of which the last is the <em class="calibre8" id="notea--50">machine</em>, or better, an <em class="calibre8" id="notea--51">automatic system of machinery</em> (system of machinery: the <em class="calibre8" id="notea--52">automatic</em> system
      is only its most complete and adequate form and for the first time changes machinery into a system)—set into
      motion by an automaton, a moving force which sets itself into motion; this automaton consisting of numerous
      mechanical and intellectual organs, so that the workers themselves are made into mere conscious appendages of
      it.<sup class="calibre13" id="notea--53"><a class="calibre14" id="noteafn8"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#noteafn8-r" id="notea--55">8</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="noindenttb" id="notea--56">
      Here Marx is taking up Ure’s own formulation.<a class="calibre6" id="noteaen2-r"></a><a class="nounder1" href="43.html#noteaen2" id="notea--58">*</a> The crux of his answer is that, in proportion as scientific technology replaces “direct
      labor” in production, it presses outside the bounds of the capitalist system.
    </div>
<div class="bq" id="notea--59">
      … to that same extent, direct labor together with its quantity disappears as the determining principle of
      production—the creation of use-values—and is not only reduced quantitatively to a slight proportion, but also
      qualitatively to a subordinate though still indispensable aspect, as compared to the general scientific labor,
      the technological application of the natural sciences on the one hand, as well as [compared to] the general force
      of production arising from the social structuring of the whole of production—[a force of production] which
      appears as a natural endowment of social labor (although it is a historical product). Thus capital works to its
      own dissolution as the form dominating production.<sup class="calibre13" id="notea--60"><a class="calibre14" id="noteafn12"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#noteafn12-r" id="notea--62">12</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="noindentt" id="notea--63">
      A little further on, he remarks also that as “capital—entirely unintentionally—reduces human labor, the
      expenditure of energy, to a minimum,” <a class="calibre6" id="page_578"></a>the consequence is that “This will redound to the
      advantage of emancipated labor, and is the condition for its emancipation.”<sup class="calibre13" id="notea--65"><a class="calibre14" id="noteafn13"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#noteafn13-r" id="notea--67">13</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="indentb" id="notea--68">
      The whole process is looked at again, some pages later, from an interesting side. As large industry develops,
      Marx explains, the tendency is for the creation of real wealth to depend less on the amount of labor used and
      more on the power of the technological agencies used, which in turn depends on advances in science and
      technology. An enormous disproportion develops between the more and more abstract labor applied and the power of
      the production process it takes care of.<sup class="calibre13" id="notea--69"><a class="calibre14" id="noteafn14"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#noteafn14-r" id="notea--71">14</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="bq" id="notea--72">
      It is no longer true so much that labor figures as [something] comprised in the production process, but rather
      the human being has the relation of caretaker and regulator to the production process itself. … He steps
      alongside the production process, instead of being its main agent. … As soon as labor in its direct form has
      ceased to be the great source of wealth, labor time ceases and must cease to be its measure, and hence exchange
      value [ceases and must cease to be the measure] of use-value. The <em class="calibre8" id="notea--73">surplus labor of the mass of
      people</em> has ceased to be the condition for the development of general wealth, just as the <em class="calibre8" id="notea--74">non-labor</em> of the few [ceases to be the condition] for the development of the general powers of
      the human head.
    </div>
<div class="noindentt" id="notea--75">
      This leads right to the basic conclusion:
    </div>
<div class="bq" id="notea--76">
      Thereupon production based on exchange value breaks down, and the direct material production process gets
      stripped of the forms of poverty and contradictoriness. The free development of individualities [is the result],
      and therefore not the reduction in necessary labor time in order to constitute surplus value, but rather the
      reduction in general of the necessary labor of society to a minimum, [an outcome] which then corresponds to the
      artistic, scientific, etc., cultivation of individuals, by virtue of the free time and means made available to
      all of them.<sup class="calibre13" id="notea--77"><a class="calibre14" id="noteafn15"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#noteafn15-r" id="notea--79">15</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="noindenttb" id="notea--80">
      Thus, under socialism, the unleashed power of technology can bring about the liberation of the individual from
      the contradictions inherent in capitalism, but under capitalism it only sharpens contradictions. For all this,
      continues Marx, bears on a contradiction of capital: capital strives to reduce labor time to a minimum while at
      the same time labor time is its measure and source of wealth (that is, of commodity values). To do the first, it
      calls on the power of science, technology, and social organization in order to make the creation of wealth
      relatively independent of the labor time used to create it. At the same time it still has to use labor time to
      measure the giant social forces unleashed and to confine the latter within the limits so set.
    </div>
<div class="bq" id="notea--81">
<a class="calibre6" id="page_579"></a>Productive forces and social relationships—two different sides of the development of the
      social individual—appear to capital only as means, and are only means for it, to carry on production on its own
      narrowly limited foundation. In fact, however, they are the material conditions for blowing up this
      foundation.<sup class="calibre13" id="notea--83"><a class="calibre14" id="noteafn16"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#noteafn16-r" id="notea--85">16</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="noindentt" id="notea--86">
      This states, from another angle, what is contained in the more famous lines from <em class="calibre8" id="notea--87">Capital:</em>
      “Centralization of the means of production and socialization of labor at last reach a point where they become
      incompatible with their capitalist integument. This integument is burst asunder. The knell of capitalist private
      property sounds.”<sup class="calibre13" id="notea--88"><a class="calibre14" id="noteafn17"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#noteafn17-r" id="notea--90">17</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="indent" id="notea--91">
      Marx argues that technology can, and will, replace direct human labor in the production of <em class="calibre8" id="notea--92">use-values</em>, but it does not produce exchange-values. As labor is reduced toward the minimum,
      then by the same token capital “without wage-labor, ceases to be capital.” The tendency toward the abolition of
      labor which was rightly heralded by Ure as the very perfection of capital is also the tendency which negates
      capital as it works itself out. The long-heralded abolition of the proletariat is a reality of the future, but
      only over the dead body of capitalism. Given the replacement of capitalism, this abolition not only becomes
      possible but is a necessary consequence of technological trends. It is also the necessary basis for the flowering
      of the human individuality freed from the blind coercion of material scarcity.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="notea--93">
      Short of those happy days, however—namely, today—the main effect of far-extended automation is in shaking the
      wage and profit system, not in shaking “the whole Marxian thesis” of proletarian revolution. The classes involved
      in direct labor are undergoing internal changes as always, but they are not likely to be merely predicted out of
      existence.
