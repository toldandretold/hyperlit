<a class="calibre6" id="foreworden1"></a><a class="nounder1" href="6.html#foreworden1-r" id="footnote--2">*</a> There is another,
      thirdhand source that dates back to September 1883. G. A. Lopatin, the Russian Populist translator of <em class="calibre8" id="footnote--3">Capital</em>, had a talk with Engels and wrote a friend the next day with a report of the
      conversation, which included this:
    </div>
<div class="fn1" id="footnote--4">
      Do you remember, as I said, that Marx himself had never been a Marxist? Engels related that during the struggle
      of Brousse, Malon and Co. against the others, Marx once laughingly said: “I can say only one thing, that I am
      <em class="calibre8" id="footnote--5">no Marxist!</em> …” (Retranslated from the German]<sup class="calibre13" id="footnote--6"><a class="calibre14" id="forewordfn10"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#forewordfn10-r" id="footnote--8">10</a></sup>

<div class="fn2" id="footnote--9">
      The “struggle of Brousse, Malon and Co. against the others” (the Marxists) took place in 1881-1882, culminating
      in the split which saw the formation of a Possibilist party versus a more-or-less Marxist party. It was, then, a
      recent event when Lopatin talked with Engels. It had been even fresher when Engels wrote his first letter about
      it to Bernstein in 1882. Yet in two of the 1890 loci, Engels had referred to the late 1870s—perhaps a lapse of
      memory. While Lopatin’s testimony is not decisive per se, his dating (reporting Engels) fits the pattern of
      events better than the “late seventies,” especially if we look at the content of Engels’ letters to Lafargue
      during those years before 1880. —One more comment on Lopatin: although he states very plainly that Marx said it
      “laughingly,” his first sentence is peculiar, as if he is trying to make something of it. For as a Populist it
      would be right up his street to believe that Marx was no more a Marxist than … Lopatin. If this is what he is
      getting at, then the jugglery with Marx’s “laughing” quip started with the first one who had the proper ax to
      grind, and its later career stands in bold relief. —Finally, let us mention Marx’s other French son-in-law,
      Charles Longuet, who included a rather vague reference in 1900 in his preface to Marx’s <em class="calibre8" id="footnote--10">Civil War in France:</em> “… well known is his witty sally [<em class="calibre8" id="footnote--11">boutade</em>]
      apropos of certain applications or concretizations of his doctrine: ‘<em class="calibre8" id="footnote--12">Toujours est-il que
      moi, je ne suis pas marxiste.</em>’ ” (Still and all, I am no Marxist.) The words are now distorted by
      approximate memory, and Longuet is too discreet even to mention that Marx was talking about the French. The
      context suggests that Longuet would like to juggle with the quotation but he does not do it explicitly.<sup class="calibre13" id="footnote--13"><a class="calibre14" id="forewordfn11"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#forewordfn11-r" id="footnote--15">11</a></sup>

      <em class="calibre8" id="footnote--19">Marxsche</em> turned up just as naturally, as when the leading Cologne paper referred to

<a class="calibre6" id="foreworden3"></a><a class="nounder1" href="6.html#foreworden3-r" id="footnote--28">*</a> One very minor
      exception has been pointed out: at the end of 1877 the French Guesdist organ <em class="calibre8" id="footnote--29">Egalité</em>
      published an unsigned article on German political economy which incidentally stated that “Lassalle adopts the
      Marxist theories”<sup class="calibre13" id="footnote--30"><a class="calibre14" id="forewordfn24"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#forewordfn24-r" id="footnote--32">24</a></sup>—a statement certain to disgruntle Marx. In France <em class="calibre8" id="footnote--33">Marxist</em> came to be used to label the Guesdists as a current distinct from the Possibilists
      and Blanquists (these latter two labels being likewise endowments by others). The Possibilist leader Paul
      Brousse, a Bakuninist who had gone over to right-wing socialism, published a brochure entitled <em class="calibre8" id="footnote--34">Le Marxisme dans I’Internationale</em> in 1882.<sup class="calibre13" id="footnote--35"><a class="calibre14" id="forewordfn25"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#forewordfn25-r" id="footnote--37">25</a></sup> After Marx’s
      death, Engels’ letters occasionally reflected this common use of <em class="calibre8" id="footnote--38">Marxist</em> for the
      French group, like everyone else; he usually, but not invariably, enclosed it in quotes.<sup class="calibre13" id="footnote--39"><a class="calibre14" id="forewordfn26"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#forewordfn26-r" id="footnote--41">26</a></sup> In his own mind the usage was secondhand, as we know from his explanation
      to Paul Lafargue: “We have never called you anything other than ‘the <em class="calibre8" id="footnote--42">so-called</em>
      Marxists’ and I would not know how else to designate you.” The trouble was, he explained, that the group had no
      short usable name that was clear to readers elsewhere.<sup class="calibre13" id="footnote--43"><a class="calibre14" id="forewordfn27"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#forewordfn27-r" id="footnote--45">27</a></sup> Writing to Laura Marx Lafargue, Engels
      remarked that “we have proved to the world that almost all Socialists in Europe are ‘Marxists’ (they will be mad
      they gave us that name!) …”<sup class="calibre13" id="footnote--46"><a class="calibre14" id="forewordfn28"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#forewordfn28-r" id="footnote--48">28</a></sup> In 1893 Laura quipped, in a jocular French-language note to Engels:
      “As for me, my dear General, you know that it’s enough to be <em class="calibre8" id="footnote--49">marxiste et engelsiste</em> to
      stay young forever!”<sup class="calibre13" id="footnote--50"><a class="calibre14" id="forewordfn29"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#forewordfn29-r" id="footnote--52">29</a></sup> It is to be hoped that Laura will not go down in marxological history as
      the Founder of Engelsism.

      answer in terms of a set of ideas is that put forward in 1933 by S. Hook, who posed the question explicitly: “it
      can be categorically stated that it is Marx’s theory of the state which distinguishes the true Marxist from the
      false.”<sup class="calibre13" id="footnote--66"><a class="calibre14" id="ch01fn16"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch01fn16-r" id="footnote--68">16</a></sup> His context is how to distinguish “liberal” Marxism, that is, Bernsteinian
      reformism. However, a social reactionary can hold a class theory of the state similar to Marx’s, merely choosing
      a different class side. To be sure, the theory may have to be clandestine, as may have been illustrated by a

      better acquainted with the movement of the lower classes,” they would know “that the extreme opposition they have
      been subjected to from practical life is changing them every day.” Literature by workers shows “that the lower
      classes know how to elevate themselves intellectually [<em class="calibre8" id="footnote--137">geistig</em>]” even without the
      help of the Bauerites. How? By organization, the “organization of the masses” of which the Bauerites talk

      This may mislead: Owen’s semi-accidental and transitory connection with the early trade-union movement only ended
      by highlighting his basic hostility to it.<sup class="calibre13" id="footnote--204"><a class="calibre14" id="ch04fn8"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch04fn8-r" id="footnote--206">8</a></sup> However, there were trade-union militants who considered

      was preparing a series of lectures on political economy published two years later as <em class="calibre8" id="footnote--214">Wage-Labor and Capital</em>. In unpublished notes for a lecture on wages and unions, Marx
      accepted without qualification the bourgeois economists’ objections to the economic rationale of unions and

      which will be cited in the next section. The difference was due to Engels’ closeness, in England, to the real
      movement. In fact, by the 1850s, after Marx moved to England, and in the midst of a strike wave, Marx began
      reflecting considerations similar to those that Engels had anticipated in 1844-1845. So much for theory without
      practice.

      at the Lausanne (1867) congress of the International, which was dominated by the French and Belgian Proudhonists.
      A formal report and full-length discussion dealt with the proposition that the existing workers’ associations,
      specifically the cooperative movement, tended to produce a “fourth estate” (a higher-paid stratum of workers) at
      the expense of the formation of a “fifth estate” (depressed low-paid workers) whose conditions were so much the
      worse. (This danger had been suggested to the International from a rightward standpoint by the
      bourgeois-democratic radical philosopher Ludwig Büchner.) The reporter, C. de Paepe, counterposed “mutualist”
      (Proudhonist) associations to cooperatives which operated simply as profit-making enterprises within the present
      system. If the latter spread, it would mean “the creation of a new class composed of cooperative members who
      share these profits,” a sort of middle class intermediate between the bourgeoisie (third estate) and the
      depressed proletariat (new fifth estate).<sup class="calibre13" id="footnote--243"><a class="calibre14" id="ch04fn74"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch04fn74-r" id="footnote--245">74</a></sup>

      reference to the lumpenproletariat, it is not altogether clear what East End elements are meant. The example of

      But this has nothing to do with Engels’ emphasis elsewhere on the success of the New Unionism in organizing the
      most depressed layers of the working class; in fact, here Engels counterposes the lumpenproletariat to “the East
      End worker.” Similarly, in a letter to a union organizer (perhaps Eleanor Marx) Engels wrote:

      the issue came to a head in the German party, in the context of the rise of Bernstein’s “Revisionismi.” The
      alleged principle of “trade-union neutrallty” was the formula by which reformists sought to prevent a trade-union
      movement from deciding to support <em class="calibre8" id="footnote--314">socialists;</em> where the trade unions were supporting
      bourgeois politicians and functioning as political appendages of bourgeois parties, the reformists swung happily
      into line. While the later Second International debates on “trade-union neutrality” are outside our purview, we
      must note that this slippery formula had nothing whatever to do with Marx’s view about the organizational
      autonomy of trade unions with relation to political parties.

      the capitalist class. In this sense the bourgeoisie would be viewed as a social penumbra around the hard core of
      capitalists proper, shading out into the diverse social elements who function as servitors or hangers-on of
      capital without themselves owning capital. I suggest this distinction <em class="calibre8" id="footnote--382">not</em> because it
      was followed by Marx but to alert the reader to the need for interpreting different cases from their context.

      It is particularly important at this point to put the spotlight on the phrase <em class="calibre8" id="footnote--410">the
      Democracy.</em> This was not the label of a set of ideas, but of a movement of the people, of the broad masses
      (in whatever sense, including vague ones). In fact, <em class="calibre8" id="footnote--411">the Democracy,</em> as used by the
      left in the nineteenth century, was very like another vague term popular in the twentieth, <em class="calibre8" id="footnote--412">the Masses</em>. A Democrat (capitalized or not) was one of the supporters of or participants in
      this movement, whatever their views on democracy in today’s sense. <em class="calibre8" id="footnote--413">The Democracy</em>
      often appeared as a capitalized noun, especially in the Chartist press, but there was no consistency, and we may
      expect that one meaning shades into the other, depending on context. Not only the Chartists: in an 1852 article
      in <em class="calibre8" id="footnote--414">the New York Tribune</em> Marx attacked the Whig leader Lord John Russell’s demagogic
      use of democratic rhetoric. Russell had said, “The people of this country are, in other words, the Democracy of
      the country.” Marx then exerted himself to show that Russell’s explanations of the label emptied it of all
      meaning.<sup class="calibre13" id="footnote--415"><a class="calibre14" id="ch07fn25"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch07fn25-r" id="footnote--417">25</a></sup> —This historical usage affects my own use of the term, where I have capitalized

      report from a more dubious source. After being badly bested by Marx in a political confrontation on March 30,
      1846, Weitling reported Marx’s views in a letter which is full of distortions; and according to this unreliable
      letter Marx had said that “As for the realization of communism, there can be no talk of it to begin with; the

<a class="calibre6" id="ch07en6"></a><a class="nounder1" href="15.html#ch07en6-r" id="footnote--436">*</a> Marx pointed more than
      once to the same pattern in another form, that is, where the proletariat is used as troops for the bourgeoisie,
      also in order to combat the enemy of its enemy. The <em class="calibre8" id="footnote--437">Communist Manifesto</em> refers to the
      undeveloped stage where “the proletarians do not fight their enemies, but the enemies of their enemies, the
      remnants of absolute monarchy …”<sup class="calibre13" id="footnote--438"><a class="calibre14" id="ch07fn35"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch07fn35-r" id="footnote--440">35</a></sup> In an article on the June 1848 uprising in Paris, Marx
      says of the February overthrow of the Louis Philippe monarchy: “What they [the people] instinctively hated in
      Louis Philippe was not Louis Philippe, but the crowned rule of a class, capital on the throne. But, magnanimous
      as always, they fancied they had destroyed their enemy after overthrowing the enemy of their enemies, the <em class="calibre8" id="footnote--441">common</em> enemy.”<sup class="calibre13" id="footnote--442"><a class="calibre14" id="ch07fn36"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch07fn36-r" id="footnote--444">36</a></sup> The same problem naturally cropped up in England too, when
      hatred of the bourgeoisie among (say) the Chartists led to illusions about the role of the Tory aristocracy,
      simply because the latter too were antibourgeois in their own way. In 1852 Engels wrote of the left-wing Chartist
      leader Ernest Jones, who was combating this tendency: “without our doctrine he would never have hit the right
      tack and would never have found out how on the one hand the instinctive class hatred of the workers against the
      industrial bourgeoisie, the sole possible basis for the reorganization of the Chartist party, can not only be
      retained but even widened, developed and made to serve as the foundation of enlightening propaganda and how on
      the other hand one can be progressive all the same and oppose the reactionary cravings of the workers and their
      prejudices.”<sup class="calibre13" id="footnote--445"><a class="calibre14" id="ch07fn37"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch07fn37-r" id="footnote--447">37</a></sup> Jones had to combat his own tendency in this same direction.<sup class="calibre13" id="footnote--448"><a class="calibre14" id="ch07fn38"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch07fn38-r" id="footnote--450">38</a></sup>
      “It was entirely natural,” thought Engels, “particularly at the beginning of the industrial revolution, that the
      workers, engaged as they were in direct struggle against only the industrial bourgeoisie, should ally themselves
      to the aristocracy and other sections of the bourgeoisie, who did not explbit them directly and who were also
      opposing the industrial bourgeoisie.” Entirely natural, like a disease, but still dangerous: “this alliance
      contaminated the working-class movement with a considerable influx of reactionary elements” and with other
      deleterious influences.<sup class="calibre13" id="footnote--451"><a class="calibre14" id="ch07fn39"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch07fn39-r" id="footnote--453">39</a></sup>

      with. While it is true that, as Engels wrote toward the end of his life, the Manifesto “marked the merger of the

      Association. Unfortunately this speech is known only through an unreliable newspaper report, which probably
      reflects its content as through a glass darkly. Marx was attacking a previous talk given by Weitling, who had
      advocated a “dictatorship … as the most desirable constitutional form.” The report summarized Marx’s argument
      against this proposal as follows:

<div class="fn1" id="footnote--591">
      … since the state power cannot be established by a single class, the idea of putting into effect a system of
      dictatorship under a single head deserves to be called nonsense; on the contrary, the governmental power must be

      electoral laws only a fraction of the workers had the right to vote; hence any electoral policy was not mainly
      directed to a proletarian constituency. (2) The group that opposed support to Democratic candidates and advocated
      workers’ candidates only, the Gottschalk clique in the Cologne Workers Association, took off from a <em class="calibre8" id="footnote--647">reactionary</em> standpoint, one that looked to an accommodation with a “social monarchy” as

      may note the resemblance between this second version of permanent revolution and Lenin’s formula “democratic
      dictatorship of the proletariat and peasantry.” Trotsky argued–rightly, I think–that there was no necessary
      incompatibility between Lenin’s formula and his own theory of permanent revolution; the former, he maintained,
      “in large measure bore an intentionally algebraic character.” But I do not think Trotsky understood that the
      basic conception of permanent revolution is itself an “algebraic” formula, that is, it can be concretized by
      different policies. Trotsky’s brief references to Marx in this connection–about going over to “socialist
      measures,” and about “the bourgeois revolution of ’48 as the direct introduction to the proletarian revolution”
      –are relevant only to Marx’s final variant.<sup class="calibre13" id="footnote--665"><a class="calibre14" id="ch09fn25"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch09fn25-r" id="footnote--667">25</a></sup> He was probably familiar mainly with the content of Marx’s
      “Address to the Communist League” of 1850, to be discussed in the next chapter. Also, needless to say, the
      preponderant role of the agrarian question and the peasantry in Russia introduced a big difference from Marx’s
      situation. For these and other reasons, it is unwise to equate the general concept of permanent revolution with
      any single application of it to a given historical situation.

      representatives (Marx, Engels, Willich), one left Chartist, and two Frenchmen of the Blanquist tendency in the

      People” drafted by Moses Hess around the end of 1849, published anonymously in 1850. Marx had nothing to do with
      this statement, and did not even know who had put it out. It is quite likely that Hess (who had been heavily
      influenced by Marx in a revolutionary direction as long as a revolution was going on) had picked up the term and
      the idea from the two places it had already appeared as a programmatic watchword, namely, the articles
      constituting <em class="calibre8" id="footnote--702">The Class Struggles in France</em> and the March address to the Communist
      League, plus discussions with League members, no doubt. In view of this, it is interesting that Hess gives strong
      emphasis to the international aspect of permanent revolution. The red flag, says his Catechism, means “the
      permanent revolution until the complete victory of the working classes in all civilized countries—the red
      republic.” And the “red republic” is to be achieved “through a revolution which must be continued on until the
      workers of all civilized countries have taken over political power.” For if the workers win in one country they
      must immediately go to the aid of their comrades in other countries, since they cannot rule in a single country
      in the long run: so says the Catechism.<sup class="calibre13" id="footnote--703"><a class="calibre14" id="ch10fn14"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch10fn14-r" id="footnote--705">14</a></sup>

      actually had the League <em class="calibre8" id="footnote--709">formally</em> dissolved at the outset of the 1848 revolution or
      only consigned it to the shelf. (In the March Address, as also elsewhere,<sup class="calibre13" id="footnote--710"><a class="calibre14" id="ch10fn26"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch10fn26-r" id="footnote--712">26</a></sup> he says the latter
      was true.) The evidence is inconclusive; but, more important, the issue is of third-rate significance, for what
      is beyond question is that during the revolution Marx did <em class="calibre8" id="footnote--713">not</em> consider it necessary
      to have a political vanguard group organized on a membership basis, as distinct from the political center
      represented by the <em class="calibre8" id="footnote--714">N.R.Z.</em> operation. The reasons for this view and its relation to
      Marx’s later opinions can be discussed usefully only in the more general context of Marx’s organizational theory.

      the trumped-up charge of “Blanquism,” that has made this Address so scandalous a document in the eyes of Marx’s
      critics. When Eduard Bernstein invented the “Blanquism” charge, it was a substitute for openly attacking the
      thesis that hit him close to the bone: the prediction that social-reformism was not merely wrong but bound to be
      the most dangerous enemy of the revolution in a crisis. But Marx’s thesis is not to be found in Blanqui or the
      actual Blanquist movement. For Blanqui the enemy was absolutism first and last, despite denunciations of the
      bourgeoisie; and in fact, as bourgeois democracy took over later in the century, the Blanquist movement itself
      merged with reformism. The opinion that Blanquist-type putschism or adventurism is incompatible with
      social-reformism has no basis either in theory or in historical experience. Reformism as a socialist tendency
      will be taken up at large in Volume 3; but we may mention that Engels reiterated the present thesis about

<a class="calibre6" id="ch10en9"></a><a class="nounder1" href="18.html#ch10en9-r" id="footnote--743">*</a> This idea had been
      stated by Marx and Engels more than once after the Manifesto; for example, in 1850: “The real revolutionary
      movement can begin in England only when the Charter has been realized, just as in France the June battle became
      possible only when the republic had been won.” Here the Charter stands for the attainment of complete
      bourgeois-democratic rights for the working-class mass. This is a strong statement because it seems to make this
      stage a <em class="calibre8" id="footnote--744">necessary</em> precondition for proletarian victory. Its weaker form is the idea
      that the bourgeoisie wants to, or would prefer to, bring about a thorough bourgeois democracy, as is indeed
      stated in the same article: “the sole state form in which our European capitalists have confidence is the <em class="calibre8" id="footnote--745">bourgeois republic</em>. In general there is only one expression for bourgeois confidence in any
      state form: <em class="calibre8" id="footnote--746">its quotation on the stock exchange</em>.” But for precisely this reason the
      ensuing experience of Bonapartism put many question marks over the expectation. In still another form, the idea
      emphasized is that the bourgeois attainment of democratic institutions brings the working class into the
      political arena; for example: “The English Freetraders are radical bourgeois who want to break radically with the
      aristocracy, in order to rule without limitation. What they overlook is that, despite themselves, they thus bring
      the people onto the stage and into power.” Other aspects of this question were taken up in our first
      volume.<sup class="calibre13" id="footnote--747"><a class="calibre14" id="ch10fn84"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch10fn84-r" id="footnote--749">84</a></sup>

      Engels remarked of the petty-bourgeoisie that “It finds its place less in production than in the distribution of
      commodities; retail trade is its main occupation.”<sup class="calibre13" id="footnote--754"><a class="calibre14" id="ch11fn2"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch11fn2-r" id="footnote--756">2</a></sup> But this must be taken as a statistical description
      referring to Germany in 1865, not as a definition. The characteristic picture of the petty-bourgeoisie is
      conveyed less technically in a passing vignette: “the German burgher can lightheartedly ponder over his plans for
      honest acquisition of a small property and his hopes for the elevation of the lower classes of the
      nation.”<sup class="calibre13" id="footnote--757"><a class="calibre14" id="ch11fn3"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch11fn3-r" id="footnote--759">3</a></sup> The key phrase here is “small property.” In a longish sociological description of
      the petty-bourgeoisie set down in an unfinished pamphlet in 1847, Engels emphasized this class’s localism, among
      other things: “The petty-bourgeois represents internal-domestic and coastwise trade, handicrafts, manufacture
      based on hand labor–branches of industry carried on in a limited terrain, requiring small amounts of capital,
      with a slow rate of turnover, giving rise only to local, sluggish competition.” And: “With its petty local
      interests, even in its days of greatest glory in the later Middle Ages it managed to arrive only at local
      organizations, local struggles, and local advances …”<sup class="calibre13" id="footnote--760"><a class="calibre14" id="ch11fn4"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch11fn4-r" id="footnote--762">4</a></sup> Here Engels’ aim is to compare it unfavorably

However, especially in the case of Marx and Engels when
      they are thinking in an English or French context, even this common German usage tends to be influenced by the
      term <em class="calibre8" id="footnote--769">petty-bourgeoisie</em>, with its etymological relation to <em class="calibre8" id="footnote--770">bourgeoisie;</em> as a result there are contexts where <em class="calibre8" id="footnote--771">kleine

      the typical capitalist it is not only very small but limited to the labor of superintendence, for both reasons
      socially inoperative, unlike the case of the petty-bourgeois. The peasant’s case, discussed in the next chapter,
      is like the petty-bourgeois.

<a class="calibre6" id="ch11en5"></a><a class="nounder1" href="19.html#ch11en5-r" id="footnote--787">*</a> I am here paraphrasing
      and somewhat generalizing another of Marx’s comments on Proudhon: on “How in this roundabout way he arrives once
      more at the standpoint of bourgeois economy.”<sup class="calibre13" id="footnote--788"><a class="calibre14" id="ch11fn17"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch11fn17-r" id="footnote--790">17</a></sup> To bring out the <em class="calibre8" id="footnote--791">bourgeois</em>
      side of the typical petty-bourgeois ideology is not to negate the difference between these class mentalities.
      This helps to explain—but not justify—the element of confusion introduced by a passage of the <em class="calibre8" id="footnote--792">Communist Manifesto</em> where Proudhon is put forward as the representative of “bourgeois
      socialism,” a social-reformism that seeks to preserve bourgeois society by “redressing social
      grievances.”<sup class="calibre13" id="footnote--793"><a class="calibre14" id="ch11fn18"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch11fn18-r" id="footnote--795">18</a></sup> This is preceded by two sections on “petty-bourgeois socialism” in which
      Proudhon is not mentioned.<sup class="calibre13" id="footnote--796"><a class="calibre14" id="ch11fn19"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch11fn19-r" id="footnote--798">19</a></sup> One may wonder: does Marx interpret Proudhon as a “bourgeois socialist”
      (as in the Manifesto) or as a “petty-bourgeois socialist” (as in most of his writings before and after the
      Manifesto)? The Manifesto treatment is ill-advised, if only because of the formal contradiction, but it is not
      altogether invalid. It stresses, perhaps overstresses, that side of Proudhon which Engels also emphasized in
      <em class="calibre8" id="footnote--799">The Housing Question</em> and <em class="calibre8" id="footnote--800">Anti Dühring</em>: Proudhon, like
      Dühring, “wants existing society, but without its abuses.” Both want to abolish the abuses of bourgeois society
      on the basis of the same laws of capitalist production that give rise to those abuses.<sup class="calibre13" id="footnote--801"><a class="calibre14" id="ch11fn20"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch11fn20-r" id="footnote--803">20</a></sup>
      This is close to the definition of “bourgeois socialism” given in the Manifesto. We should also remember that the
      reference to Proudhon in the Manifesto is specifically to the book by Proudhon that Marx had attacked the year
      before in his <em class="calibre8" id="footnote--804">Poverty of Philosophy</em>. Engels eventually had occasion to remark that
      “Marx’s <em class="calibre8" id="footnote--805">Poverty of Philosophy</em> appeared several years before Proudhon put forward his
      practical proposals for social reform” in an 1851 work.<sup class="calibre13" id="footnote--806"><a class="calibre14" id="ch11fn21"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch11fn21-r" id="footnote--808">21</a></sup> Perhaps at the time of writing the Manifesto
      Marx was less clear on the trend of Proudhon’s thinking, although he had already characterized it as
      petty-bourgeois.

      petty-bourgeoisie, which flourished in medieval Nuremberg, is now falling to pieces along with the

      remarks on this issue is not a mistake but may be very misleading to modern readers. “If in Germany, for
      instance, the democratic petty-bourgeoisie belonged to this reactionary mass,” asks Engels, how could your party
      (Eisenacher party) have collaborated with the South German People’s Party for so many years, and how could your

      Liebknecht’s opportunist policy of adaptation to the South German petty-bourgeois radicals, but rather a sharp
      thrust against it; both Engels and Marx had been criticizing this course for some time. Engels is pointing out:
      now, after a long opportunist relationship with the People’s Party, you are making a 180-degree flipflop in
      rhetoric, consigning yesterday’s partner to the same “one reactionary mass” as the right-wing reactionaries, thus

      rural laborer subsumed under the peasantry, especially in passing or implicitly. This may be merely a
      terminological convenience: the farmhands are being regarded <em class="calibre8" id="footnote--923">socially</em> as part of a
      peasant population, particularly where the dividing lines are still tenuous; for example, the laborers may till
      small plots, they may be related to peasants on all sides, and not separately organized in any way, perhaps still
      hoping to save enough pennies to buy a patch of land. At one point Engels’ <em class="calibre8" id="footnote--924">Condition of

      Another terminological point about some socialist literature, usually quite clear in context, is the use of
      <em class="calibre8" id="footnote--928">peasantry</em> to refer only to the small peasantry. Engels makes this usage explicit in
      an 1847 piece.<sup class="calibre13" id="footnote--929"><a class="calibre14" id="ch12fn63"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch12fn63-r" id="footnote--931">63</a></sup>

      that <a class="nounder1" href="15.html#ch07" id="footnote--935">Chapter 7</a> set forth Engels’ role in 1847 in
      proposing the perspective of a proletarian alliance with the peasantry and petty-bourgeoisie, at a time when Marx
      showed no sign of thinking along these lines. (Where did Engels get this complex of ideas? Certainly not from his
      new associates of the Communist League; this is clear from the contents of the trial issue of the <em class="calibre8" id="footnote--936">Kommunistische Zeitung</em> in September 1847—it did not contain a single mention of the
      peasantry.) Next, during the revolution of 1848-1849 the <em class="calibre8" id="footnote--937">N.R.Z.</em> group innovated a
      whole body of revolutionary peasant politics, as will be seen in the next chapter. Following the revolution,
      Engels’ first historical work was <em class="calibre8" id="footnote--938">The Peasant War in Germany.</em> This inaugurated a
      whole series of historical investigations, many remaining in manuscript. Such an essay as “The Mark” was written
      explicitly as socialist education for peasants; note its first and last paragraphs. An index to marxological
      interest in the peasantry is the fact that most of these writings of Engels’ are virtually never mentioned or
      cited, in acres and acres of Marxist and anti-Marxist literature. —Engels’ interest in the question
      characteristically extended down to details. A tiny one: in 1865 he translated a Danish folk song from the period
      of the medieval peasant war in Jutland, for publication in the party press, along with the following comment: “In
      a country like Germany, where the owning class comprises feudal aristocracy as much as bourgeoisie, and the
      proletariat comprises agricultural proletarians as much as or more than industrial workers, this vigorous old
      peasants’ song is right to the point.” The point of the song was peasant resistance to oppressive
      taxation.<sup class="calibre13" id="footnote--939"><a class="calibre14" id="ch12fn67"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch12fn67-r" id="footnote--941">67</a></sup>

      clear that the pessimism was justified for the moment, as an estimate of the situation in October 1848 in France.
      By the same token it meant that a proletarian revolution had become impossible. Engels’ pessimism about the
      current prospect did not depend only on his acquaintance with the peasantry. His travel sketches begin with a
      hail-and-farewell to Paris: after bloody class struggles “the workers, breadless and weaponless, ground their
      teeth in suppressed anger … But Paris was dead; it was Paris no more.”<sup class="calibre13" id="footnote--945"><a class="calibre14" id="ch12fn78"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch12fn78-r" id="footnote--947">78</a></sup>

      Greek-rooted meaning was gradually displaced; as usual there was an overlap, with both meanings in use for a
      while. However, it is difficult to believe that in 1847-1848 this word would be used with no consciousness of its
      correct Greek meaning by a university-educated scholar who had just written his doctoral dissertation on Greek
      philosophy and liked to read Greek drama in the original. Furthermore, even today in German <em class="calibre8" id="footnote--956">Idiotismus</em> does not primarily mean idiocy (which is <em class="calibre8" id="footnote--957">Idiotie</em>); it
      usually means idiom, like its cognate in French <em class="calibre8" id="footnote--958">idiotisme.</em> –The 1850 translation of

      of the eternal peasant: “The emptiness of ages in his face … dead to rapture and despair … Stolid … a brother to
      the ox … [with] loosened … brutal jaw … Whose breath blew out the light within his brain? … This monstrous thing
      distorted and soul-quenched … this dumb terror …” This rhapsody is from Edwin Markham’s renowned poem “The Man
      with the Hoe,” based on Millet’s painting; it is commonly included in anthologies of “Songs of Freedom” and such.
      I suggest that this expresses the typical bourgeois-liberal, not revolutionary, attitude toward this class; for
      there can be no revolutionary expectations from the zombies here portrayed.

      Fortunately, it was subsequently dropped, for it is not an enlightening way to make the valid distinction. –About
      the same time, Engels made a related point, with a very dubious qualification: the peasantry “will never assert
      its interests and assume its position as an independent class, except in countries where universal suffrage is
      established.”<sup class="calibre13" id="footnote--975"><a class="calibre14" id="ch12fn100"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch12fn100-r" id="footnote--977">100</a></sup> The thought here, no doubt, is that the peasantry is drawn into political
      life at least when it is given the vote; and of course this is true. To that extent the peasant becomes conscious
      of itself politically. The difficulty with Engels’ formulation is the word <em class="calibre8" id="footnote--978">independent:</em> even when the peasantry acts as a class at the ballot box, to what extent does
      it act independently, rather than as a tail to another’s kite? <em class="calibre8" id="footnote--979">The Eighteenth

      Russia would have hastened revolution in Russia and hence all over Europe. But his first ground is this: “because

      substituting Free Soil agitation for a revolutionary social program, he also allied himself with Tammany Hall,
      appealed to the rich for support, and opposed the abolition of slavery (since it would increase competition among

      acquiring parcels of land. The issue came up because the Prussian government, eager to preserve a strong
      peasantry as a base for itself against bourgeois influence, wanted to set a legal limit on parcellization of
      land, and the liberal bourgeoisie energetically opposed this in the name of economic liberty. As editor of the
      <em class="calibre8" id="footnote--1200">Rheinische Zeitung</em> Marx planned to discuss this question in an article, which was

M.
      Arndt, who was “opposed to the unlimited freedom and divisibility of the land; he sees as its inevitable result
      the parcellization of land into pieces too small to provide a living.” Engels here upheld complete “freedom of
      the soil” as a guard against the two extremes of concentration and splintering, even though it might mean
      constant fluctuation, for “I prefer the surging ocean with its grand freedom to the narrow inland lake with its
      peaceful surface whose tiny ripples are broken every three yards by a spit of land, tree root, or rock.”<sup class="calibre13" id="footnote--1207"><a class="calibre14" id="ch14fn60"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch14fn60-r" id="footnote--1209">60</a></sup> He was to discover that there were phenomena other than oceans and lakes.

      Galician peasant hostility to landlordism as a stick to beat the Polish nationalist movement, thus playing class

      The destruction of the precapitalist mediaeval order of society was accompanied by the rise of an increasingly

      vagabonds, tramps, mercenaries and adventurers, infested the highways, pillaging and killing. This gray army of

      This army of the rootless was <em class="calibre8" id="footnote--1284">one</em> of the sources from which the modern proletariat

      first volume (in the German edition, Chapter 24, sections 1-3); Chapter 28 should be read in the present
      connection. The breaking up of the bands of feudal retainers and the clearing of people off the soil created a
      plebeian mass that no longer had a legal mode of existence, and could not suddenly adapt itself to the new
      capitalist discipline. Marx calls it the <em class="calibre8" id="footnote--1286">vogelfrei</em> proletariat— “outlaw,” that is,
      “free” and footloose because placed outside the legal society.

      The “dangerous class,” the social scum, that passively rotting mass thrown off by the lowest layers of old

      The rendering “dangerous class” is discussed in Special Note G. In addition, there are two small differences to

      possible role of the lumpenproletariat in revolution is weakened by “may.” Both changes reflect the later

      outstanding in the modern world as the home of an active movement for monarchism. Hobsbawm refers to Naples

      Naples, the quintessential ‘mob,’ were passionate defenders of Church and King, and even more savage
      anti-Jacobins in 1799.” Hobsbawm, however, does not focus on the lumpenproletariat as such but on the usually
      broader phenomenon of the “mob,” which, while it may include a high proportion of lumpen-elements, is more like
      the older plebs in degenerate form. But his chapter on “The City Mob” is very useful supplementary reading for
      our present subject: particularly for insights like the symbiotic relation between “the rulers and the parasitic
      poor,” the situation of “the unskilled dole-drawing proletariat who lived on ducal bounties” in Parma, or “the

      the Arabs, who remember “they once produced great philosophers, scholars, etc., but Europeans sneer at them for
      their ignorance today.” Here is the fable:

<div class="fnbqi" id="footnote--1467">
      A ferryman keeps a small boat for crossing a turbulent river. A philosopher, headed for the opposite bank, gets

      insisted on Lefort’s right to fill a post, these same Proudhonists would have eventually discovered that he was a
      dictator, if not an agent of the kaiser. But in point of fact it was Marx who was instrumental in persuading the
      General Council to yield to their ultimatum, since the British members trusted Marx’s judgment in these matters.
      So completely satisfactory did the Proudhonists find Marx’s organizational conduct and policies that even later
      they voiced no criticism. Even in the “history” of the International by Tolain’s lieutenant Fribourg, written
      after both Tolain and Fribourg were reviling the Paris Communards as “sanguinary maniacs” and with other such
      pleasantries, not once did Fribourg charge Marx with any antidemocratic or objectionable action: an amazing fact
      in those days, when political conflicts were accompanied by charges of bureaucratic crimes and embezzlement as
      automatically as saying hello. This casts a backlight on the common marxological assertion that Marx “suppressed”
      Bakunin’s faction because of political disagreement, rather than because the Bakuninists were systematically
      wrecking the organization from within in order to replace it with their own group. Politically the Proudhonists
      were in deeper disagreement with Marx than Bakunin seemed to be; but organizationally speaking, the Proudhonists
      did not engage in the wrecking tactics throughout the International that were the Bakuninists’ stock in trade.

      to another, that the Proudhonists’ exclusionary proposal was aimed at Marx in the first place, or that Tolain was
      “gunning” for Marx. Just the contrary: Cremer and Carter brought Marx’s name into the debate because his role in
      the International would be regarded as the best refutation of Tolain’s blanket proposal, not in order to defend
      Marx himself. Tolain’s motion would not have made sense as an attack on Marx for the simple reason that Marx was
      not a delegate at the congress. And, we can add on top of all this, Tolain even tried to claim in the debate that

      other issues in this area that are only superficially relevant. (1) At the same Council meeting, the journalist
      Peter Fox was elected general secretary over the trade-unionist Cremer; but there was a special reason. Cremer
      had recently abandoned that post in rather reprehensible fashion and plainly could not be relied on; Fox was the
      only immediate alternative, but in spite of all, Cremer was later given back the post for a while.<sup class="calibre13" id="footnote--1516"><a class="calibre14" id="ch18fn54"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch18fn54-r" id="footnote--1518">54</a></sup> (2) The year before, Marx had been urged to take over the editorship of the
      <em class="calibre8" id="footnote--1519">Bee-Hive.</em> He was very wary of the responsibility: “I shall consider the thing from
      all its 24 sides before I take a step one way or the other,” he wrote Engels.<sup class="calibre13" id="footnote--1520"><a class="calibre14" id="ch18fn55"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch18fn55-r" id="footnote--1522">55</a></sup> He did not accept;
      we have no record of his motivation, though it is not hard to reconstruct. (3) When Engels joined the General
      Council in 1870, he was proposed for financial secretary. The minutes report: “Cit. Engels objected that none but
      working men ought to be appointed to have anything to do [with] the finances.” But “Cit. Marx did not consider
      the objection tenable; an ex-commercial man was the best for the office.”<sup class="calibre13" id="footnote--1523"><a class="calibre14" id="ch18fn56"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch18fn56-r" id="footnote--1525">56</a></sup> Engels persisted in
      refusing—justifiably, in my opinion, for a reason previously touched on. Handling money was the touchiest job in
      the workers’ movement, riskier to reputation than anything else; for charges of financial irregularity were
      routine as soon as a conflict started, the absence of evidence being only proof of the cleverness of the
      embezzler. Also, there was among the Council members an undercurrent of resentment against Engels, at least for a
      while. He, unknown to them until he moved to London in 1870 and had been co-opted onto the Council, thereafter
      plainly became Marx’s right-hand man and confidant. Of course, the fact of old friendship was well known and
      explanatory, but to envious elements it looked like this: a Johnny-come-lately who has had no previous part in
      building the International suddenly arrives and takes on status as Marx’s close colleague, overshadowing older
      members. This is my own reconstruction of the situation—there were only grumblings and so there is little to go
      on—and it is not clear how many Council members were thus affected.

<a class="calibre6" id="ch18en10"></a><a class="nounder1" href="27.html#ch18en10-r" id="footnote--1528">*</a> Marx spotlighted such
      public declarations by Section 12 as that it must “remonstrate against the vain assumption … that the
      International … is an organization of the working classes.” Section 12, like Tolain, did not reject the principle
      of working-class self-emancipation; it merely redefined it into its opposite: “The statement that the
      emancipation of the working classes can only be conquered by themselves, cannot be denied, yet it is true so far
      as it describes the fact that the working classes cannot be emancipated against their will.”<sup class="calibre13" id="footnote--1529"><a class="calibre14" id="ch18fn58"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch18fn58-r" id="footnote--1531">58</a></sup> An article by Engels ironically explained that, whereas in Europe the bourgeois
      press has made the International such a bogeyman “that no one need be afraid that the International will ever be
      led astray from its original aims by a mass influx of bourgeois elements,” the United States was so much more
      advanced that “while the men of the European bourgeoisie trembled before the International, two bourgeois
      American women … conceived the plan of exploiting this fear-inspiring society …”<sup class="calibre13" id="footnote--1532"><a class="calibre14" id="ch18fn59"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch18fn59-r" id="footnote--1534">59</a></sup>

<a class="calibre6" id="ch18en12"></a><a class="nounder1" href="27.html#ch18en12-r" id="footnote--1540">*</a> It was Bakunin’s
      regular pattern to accuse Marx in public of exactly what he, Bakunin, was planning in secret—the difference being
      that <em class="calibre8" id="footnote--1541">his</em> ends were admirable whereas Marx’s were always “oppressive, odious and
      despicable.” Bakunin’s admiring biographer, E. H. Carr, explains his subject in the following way:
    </div>
<div class="fnbqi" id="footnote--1542">
      This contrast between the roles assigned [by Bakunin] to the International as a whole and to the [Bakuninist]
      Alliance explains the inconsistency with which Bakunin has frequently been reproached. In the International he
      demanded complete freedom for the individual. He denounced the despotism of Marx and the General Council, who
      wanted to “turn the International into a sort of monstrously colossal State, subject to a single official opinion
      represented by a strong central authority.” … But these principles did not in the least apply to the select and
      secret Alliance, whose members were to be “like unseen pilots in the tempest of popular passion.” The revolution
      was to be directed “not by any visible power, but by the collective dictatorship of all the members of the
      Alliance.” For this purpose, members of the Alliance must be willing to submit their personal freedom to
      discipline as rigid as that of the Jesuits (Bakunin returns more than once to this comparison), whose strength
      lay in the “obliteration of the individual before the collective will, organization and activity.” Bakunin could
      see nothing incompatible in demanding the loosest form of organization for the International and the strictest
      possible discipline in the ranks of the Alliance.<sup class="calibre13" id="footnote--1543"><a class="calibre14" id="ch18fn66"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch18fn66-r" id="footnote--1545">66</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="noindentt" id="footnote--1546">
      There is nothing incompatible in these two proposals, if Bakunin is understood; for his objective was to destroy
      the International in effect and replace it with his own secret band of collective dictators, through a
      boring-from-within operation. The incompatibility lies only in Carr’s (and others’) myth that Bakunin was a
      champion of something called libertarianism.

<div class="bqt" id="footnote--1551">
      Bakunin laid all his hopes of revolutionizing the country [Russia] on the intelligentsia. In his time, the
      formation of this new stratum of Russian society was proceeding rapidly … The Russian term for it, <em class="calibre8" id="footnote--1552">raznochintzy</em> (people of various positions), is a clear indication of its social origin.

<div class="noindentt" id="footnote--1556">
      We need not here broach the question of defining this “class” of splinters. This much is clear: in this backward

      that Marx made a practice of <em class="calibre8" id="footnote--1624">not</em> writing in corrections to editors who printed
      misstatements about him, whether in bourgeois or socialist papers. There were important exceptions, but they were
      exceptions to a rule: “if I denied everything that has been said and written of me, I would require a score of

      Marx and Engels exchanged letters about what Schweitzer’s paper had done in its account of a speech by Marx. The
      speech was made into “colossal muck”; it had Marx “talking pure Schweitzerism,” wrote Engels. Marx then informed
      his friend that he had written <em class="calibre8" id="footnote--1634">Liebknecht</em> that the quotes were the exact opposite of

      should note that Marx and Engels frequently expressed their chagrin and disgust at the stuff Liebknecht put into
      the <em class="calibre8" id="footnote--1638">Volksstaat</em>, without ever making a public demonstration. The sharpest statement
      came later, when Engels wrote that “The <em class="calibre8" id="footnote--1639">Volksstaat</em> under William [Liebknecht] is

      revolution were permeated with “Blanquism,” and that the March Address merely expressed this Blanquism to the

      The <em class="calibre8" id="footnote--1710">lower strata of the middle class</em>—the small <em class="calibre8" id="footnote--1711">tradespeople,</em> shopkeepers, and <em class="calibre8" id="footnote--1712">retired tradesmen generally</em>,
      the handicraftsmen and peasants—all these sink <em class="calibre8" id="footnote--1713">gradually</em> into the proletariat,
      partly because their diminutive capital does not suffice for the scale on which Modern Industry is carried on,
      and is swamped in the competition with the <em class="calibre8" id="footnote--1714">large</em> capitalists, partly because their
      <em class="calibre8" id="footnote--1715">specialized</em> skill is rendered worthless by new methods of production. Thus the

      The key change is in the first phrase, which states what the passage is about: the small intermediate strata
      <em class="calibre8" id="footnote--1720">that have existed up to now</em>. The italicized qualification is completely omitted,
      perhaps because the time reference was considered superannuated in 1888. Whatever the reason was in 1888, it is
      quite clear that the passage was concerned with the old intermediate strata, and was not a statement about middle
      classes in general or for the future. Moreover, the 1848 text clearly included both the old petty-bourgeoisie and
      small bourgeois employers and manufacturers; two phrases pointing to the latter were dropped in 1888. Thus,
      insofar as the subject was broader than the old petty-bourgeoisie, it extended not to other types of intermediate
      elements but to the lower ranks of the bourgeoisie itself.

      Alas, Moore used <em class="calibre8" id="footnote--1733">disappear</em> for <em class="calibre8" id="footnote--1734">gehen unter</em> (go under),

      the strong word <em class="calibre8" id="footnote--1736">heutzutage</em> (nowadays, in the present day). And so the meaning of the
      English version is distorted by the two words <em class="calibre8" id="footnote--1737">finally disappear</em> —and neither of
      these two words exists in the original! The new language about <em class="calibre8" id="footnote--1738">fractions of the middle

The word <em class="calibre8" id="footnote--1739">extinction</em> is of a piece with <em class="calibre8" id="footnote--1740">disappear</em>: the German is <em class="calibre8" id="footnote--1741">Untergang</em>, a going-under (noun equivalent of <em class="calibre8" id="footnote--1742">gehen unter).</em> All

      translation has been neglected as a political document. After all, Harney was at the time a political friend of
      Marx and Engels, especially the latter; both had had writings published in Harney’s <em class="calibre8" id="footnote--1816">Democratic Review</em> earlier in 1850. The translator, Helen Macfarlane, was “the admired

      best socialist woman writer of the time, sat down to translate a German document with unfamiliar ideas, would she
      have hesitated to check difficult points with the authors, who were readily available and no doubt eager to
      ensure an accurate rendering? This line of thought does not make Marx and Engels responsible for the Macfarlane
      version, but it warrants treating this translation with special attention. Incidentally, the editorial note
      introducing the translation was the first public announcement of the Manifesto’s authorship, and must have been
      published by agreement with Marx and Engels. Some months later, Engels was planning to use the Macfarlane
      translation as the basis of a discussion circle in Manchester with some of Harney’s friends; later in 1851 Marx
      tried to get his American friends to reprint it as a pamphlet, and perhaps even wanted to publish it in the

      lumpen-Irish for its own purposes:

<div class="fn3" id="footnote--1833">
      Catholicism has its sole support in England in the two extremes of society, the aristocracy and the

    </div>
<div class="fnbq" id="footnote--1876">

      spoke strongly against the idea of a proletarian party taking control of government in a situation when it could
      not introduce measures “appropriate to the proletariat” but only put into effect the program of the
      petty-bourgeoisie. This polemic against an adventuristic, premature seizure of power (or dreams about it) will be
      important for our examination of other subjects. In the course of it Marx stated: “I have always gainsaid the

      an untoward episode took place in 1865, significant in hindsight. Marx had made a speech in which <em class="calibre8" id="footnote--1896">inter alia</em> he had criticized the Lassalleans’ pet state-help program. Eccarius wrote up a
      report for the Lassallean <em class="calibre8" id="footnote--1897">Social-Demokrat</em>, and instead of including Marx’s critique
      he put Lassalleanized views into Marx’s mouth! Engels and Marx both thought the Lassalleans must have rewritten
      the article, but Eccarius admitted this was not so. Marx was amazed but, in a letter to Engels, hastens to make
      excuses for his friend’s “incomprehensible blunder.” He writes: “I have told Eccarius privately not to bother
      himself over the crap … Eccarius was very ill, and this is indeed to blame for the nonsense.”<a class="calibre6" id="notehfn38"></a><a class="nounder1" href="39_split_001.html#notehfn38-r" id="footnote--1899"><sup class="calibre24" id="footnote--1900">38</sup></a> It is clear in hindsight that Eccarius had inaugurated his pattern of writing

      of the myth, which has come to be repeated from one marxological work to another, that Marx and Engels did not

      without understanding what Engels is writing about. The sentence, out of context, goes as follows: “If a single
      copy of our 17 Points were distributed here, all would be lost for us here.” The context was Engels’ mid-April
      trip to his home town Barmen to raise money for the <em class="calibre8" id="footnote--1962">Neue Rheinische Zeitung</em> by
      selling shares—hopefully, to his relatives, family, and old friends who had once been sympathetic to radical
      talk. Thus the mission was primarily financial, though he also kept an eye out for recruits to the Communist
      League.<sup class="calibre13" id="footnote--1963"><a class="calibre14" id="notejfn15"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#notejfn15-r" id="footnote--1965">15</a></sup> It is clear from his correspondence that this visit home was enormously
      depressing; and anyone who wants to psychologize about Engels’ relations with his Pietist profiteering father is
      welcome to this material, on condition that it is understood it has nothing to do with the course actually
      followed by Marx. Engels had actually hoped that his father might take some shares; this is also mentioned in a
      letter that Marx sent him in Barmen, urgently pressing him to put the squeeze on the old man and other
      acquaintances.<sup class="calibre13" id="footnote--1966"><a class="calibre14" id="notejfn16"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#notejfn16-r" id="footnote--1968">16</a></sup> But Engels had only bad news to report: his father thought even the bourgeois
      press was subversive, and would rather fill his son’s associates with bullets than dollars; all the former
      radical bourgeois he had known were now fearful and despairing, antilabor, averse to discussing social questions
      as “incitement.” Engels wrote back to Cologne: “At bottom, the thing is that even these radical bourgeois here
      see in us their main enemies of the future …” The sentence we started with follows at this point; that is, what
      would be “lost” would be the possibility of getting money for the <em class="calibre8" id="footnote--1969">N.R.Z.</em> out of
      these ex-progressive bourgeois of Barmen. The next sentence is: “The mood among the bourgeois is truly vile.”
      (Then Engels reports that the workers are beginning to stir a little, having formed “coalitions,” but adds:
      “This, however, precisely is in <em class="calibre8" id="footnote--1970">our</em> way.” This remark is unexplained.) In any case
      it is the financial mission that is at stake.<sup class="calibre13" id="footnote--1971"><a class="calibre14" id="notejfn17"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#notejfn17-r" id="footnote--1973">17</a></sup> In fact, precious little was extracted from these

      though no doubt if his bourgeois friends knew about this, “all would be lost” twice over. None of this has
      anything to do with the wide use actually made of the seventeen Demands in the course of the Marx group’s work in
