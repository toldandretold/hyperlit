    A note to <a class="nounder4" id="notee--4" href="18.html#ch10">Chapter 10</a>, page 259</h2>

    <div class="indent" id="notee--5">
      More than any other writing by Marx and Engels, this circular letter sent to the membership of the Communist
      League in the spring of 1850 has been the target of remarkable exercises in exegesis by ingenious marxologists.
      These efforts roughly divide into two types. Many—for example, George Lichtheim—assert that the Address
      represented a temporary “Blanquist aberration” for Marx, from which he recovered at some later date.<sup id="notee--6" class="calibre13"><a id="noteefn1" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="notee--8" href="39_split_001.html#noteefn1-r">1</a></sup> This
      serves to declare it null and void as an expression of Marx’s Marxism. A smaller contingent presses beyond this
      myth and into fantasyland with the assertion that Marx never really held with the infamous document even when it
      was written.
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="notee--9">
      The general reason for these special operations on the Address is the uncompromising revolutionary spirit of the
      document. It breathes this spirit from every paragraph, and therefore offends people who can think kindly of Marx
      only as a bearded gentleman browsing through statistical abstracts in the British Museum.
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="notee--10">
      In this volume the March Address is considered in connection with the permanent revolution problem, the relation
      between bourgeois revolution and proletarian revolution. In Volume 3 it will play an important role with respect
      to Marx’s views on the road to power, and in this connection Marx’s relationship to Blanqui and Blanquism will be
      considered at large; it will be important also for yet another question, that of party organization. In this note
      we are interested only in establishing Marx’s continuing responsibility for the contents and ideas of the March
      Address.
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="notee--11">
      Insofar as it is merely claimed that Marx later silently abandoned the ideas of the March Address, refutation
      must come from the main body of this work. This note, however, indicates at least that neither Marx nor Engels
      was aware of his alleged transmogrification. It is mainly in transports of enthusiasm that marxologists claim
      otherwise. Thus, an eminent authority wrote in passing of the March Address that it was “recalled and condemned
      by its author [meaning Marx] that same <a id="page_600" class="calibre6"></a>summer,” but it should not be supposed that this
      marxologist meant what he wrote. It was only a Pickwickian way of expressing the mistaken opinion that Marx
      implicitly contradicted the content of the Address by his speech at the split meeting of the Communist League
      executive on September 15, 1850, which we have set forth in <a class="nounder1" id="notee--13" href="10.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>.<sup id="notee--14" class="calibre13"><a id="noteefn2" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="notee--16" href="39_split_001.html#noteefn2-r">2</a></sup>

    <h3 class="h3a" id="noteelev1">1. MARX’S OFFICIAL DOCUMENTS</h3>

    <div class="indent" id="notee--18">
      One of the handles found by some enterprising marxologists is the fact that the March Address was issued in the
      name of the Central Committee of the League, and therefore not actually signed by Marx and Engels. This is as
      good a place as any to take up Marx’s attitude toward such documents of his. There are four such documents of
      great importance; indeed, these four have a claim to be considered the four most important pieces Marx ever wrote
      as specific presentations of political policy. (They are rivaled only by the circular letter to the German party
      leadership written by Marx and Engels in September 1879, including “The Manifesto of the Three
      Zurichers.”)<sup id="notee--19" class="calibre13"><a id="noteefn3" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="notee--21" href="39_split_001.html#noteefn3-r">3</a></sup>
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="notee--22">
      In chronological order these four were: the <em id="notee--23" class="calibre8">Communist Manifesto</em>, the March Address, the
      Inaugural Address of the International, and <em id="notee--24" class="calibre8">The Civil War in France.</em> Although all of
      these were issued as organization statements without a personal signature, it is only the March Address that has
      ever been impugned for this reason.
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="notee--25">
      There was a reason why so many basic documents were written as movement statements rather than personal remarks:
      it usually required some such need before Marx undertook the chore of marshaling his political views into a
      formal presentation. But there were disadvantages —and not only because some future marxologist would seize on
      the organizational sponsorship to claim that Marx somehow didn’t really mean what he wrote. The disadvantage that
      Marx was painfully aware of has already been brought out in connection with the Manifesto. As Engels told Marx
      about his own draft: “… I mean to get it through [the League] in a form in which there will at least be nothing
      contrary to our views.”<sup id="notee--26" class="calibre13"><a id="noteefn4" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="notee--28" href="39_split_001.html#noteefn4-r">4</a></sup>
    </div>

    <div class="indentb" id="notee--29">
      The last two of the four documents were written for the General Council of the International, to be signed by all
      Council members; and we know a good deal more about the conditions under which they were drafted. The one that
      was written under the greatest political constraint was the Inaugural Address; it was a very ticklish business to
      find <a id="page_601" class="calibre6"></a>formulations that would not bring objections from the very disparate elements brought
      together at the inception of the International, and yet would also express the basic principles that Marx felt
      were rock-bottom conditions for the political program of the movement.<a id="noteeen1-r" class="calibre6"></a><a class="nounder1" id="notee--32" href="43.html#noteeen1">*</a> It is a supreme understatement to say that Marx did not pour all his
      views into the Inaugural Address!—and yet not even marxologists have claimed he wrote anything in that brilliant
      essay with which he disagreed. Marx explained to Engels privately:
    </div>

    <div class="bqi" id="notee--33">
      It was very difficult to frame the thing so that our view should appear in a form acceptable from the present
      standpoint of the workers’ movement. … It will take time before the reawakened movement allows the old boldness
      of speech. It will be necessary to be <em id="notee--34" class="calibre8">fortiter in re, suaviter in modo</em> [strong in
      content, gentle in manner].<sup id="notee--35" class="calibre13"><a id="noteefn6" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="notee--37" href="39_split_001.html#noteefn6-r">6</a></sup>
    </div>

    <div class="indentt" id="notee--38">
      <em id="notee--39" class="calibre8">The Civil War in France</em> had been preceded by two Addresses on the War, likewise written
      by Marx. When he sent copies of the Second Address on the War to Engels, he reminded his friend: “You must not
      forget that the General Council °has to deal with susceptibilities from all sides and hence cannot write the same
      way we two can in our own name.”<sup id="notee--40" class="calibre13"><a id="noteefn7" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="notee--42" href="39_split_001.html#noteefn7-r">7</a></sup> This caution applies to <em id="notee--43" class="calibre8">The Civil War in France</em> as well.
      Although this work is sometimes discussed as if Marx had set it down as a definitive thesis on various problems
      of revolution, the fact is that it was primarily an educational-propagandist undertaking of the hour. Marx had to
      consider what fit into this aim, as well as what might make it difficult to get a quick, unanimous approval by
      the General Council under pressure.<sup id="notee--44" class="calibre13"><a id="noteefn8" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="notee--46" href="39_split_001.html#noteefn8-r">8</a></sup> When Marx’s daughter Jenny wrote to friends that “The French translation of
      the <em id="notee--47" class="calibre8">Civil War</em> has made a very good impression on the [Communard] refugees, for it has
      equally satisfied all parties—Blanquists, Proudhonists, and Communists,”<sup id="notee--48" class="calibre13"><a id="noteefn9" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="notee--50" href="39_split_001.html#noteefn9-r">9</a></sup> the remarkable difficulty
      of this accomplishment must be appreciated.
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="notee--51">
      In short, these group-sponsored documents, written but not signed by Marx or by Marx and Engels, expressed the
      authors’ views but did not necessarily include everything they might have written on the subject under other
      circumstances. Which is exactly what we should have known in advance.
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="notee--52">
      It is worth noting another aspect of these documents. Since they were written to be signed by a group or its
      executive, they were <a id="page_602" class="calibre6"></a>presumably drafted more or less on the basis of previous discussions or
      exchanges of opinion. This has to be qualified where we know the facts. We saw that the writing of the Manifesto
      was preceded by lively discussion and controversy in the group; but it was apparently agreed that Marx’s final
      draft—the one that went to the printer—need not be reviewed by the League executive, let alone subjected to
      amendment. Thus, Marx’s final formulations were no doubt conditioned by the previous discussions, but were not
      dependent on formal approval in the last stage. In the case of the Inaugural Address, there was indeed a meeting
      of the General Council at which a couple of inconsequential amendments were made before the document was
      approved.<sup id="notee--54" class="calibre13"><a id="noteefn10" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="notee--56" href="39_split_001.html#noteefn10-r">10</a></sup> In the case of <em id="notee--57" class="calibre8">The Civil War in France</em>, the address
      was “carried unanimously without discussion” upon being read to the Council, but of course the members had been
      discussing the Commune revolution from the start.<sup id="notee--58" class="calibre13"><a id="noteefn11" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="notee--60" href="39_split_001.html#noteefn11-r">11</a></sup> In all three of these cases, where we know something of the
      background, it is clear that Marx drafted the document with the signing group in mind but that in fact the
      signing group itself made no changes, or no significant changes, in the draft.
    </div>

    <div class="indentb" id="notee--61">
      In the case of the March Address, we know least of all about the organizational circumstances of its adoption,
      because of the paucity of extant documents on this period of the Communist League.<sup id="notee--62" class="calibre13"><a id="noteefn12" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="notee--64" href="39_split_001.html#noteefn12-r">12</a></sup> Just as gods always
      live in the darkness just beyond the circle of light thrown by our knowledge, so also marxological myths. In this
      sense, Nicolaievsky’s treatment of the March Address is divine. In the same note in which, as we saw,<sup id="notee--65" class="calibre13"><a id="noteefn13" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="notee--67" href="39_split_001.html#noteefn13-r">13</a></sup> he
      informed us that Marx mentioned permanent revolution <em id="notee--68" class="calibre8">only</em> in the March Address, he also
      asserted that
    </div>

    <div class="bq" id="notee--69">
      we have at our disposal the final text of the document as it was approved by the London Central Committee of the
      re-established League—of course, after Willich and the followers of Schapper had made their corrections.<sup id="notee--70" class="calibre13"><a id="noteefn14" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="notee--72" href="39_split_001.html#noteefn14-r">14</a></sup>
    </div>

    <div class="noindenttb" id="notee--73">
      “Of course,” Nicolaievsky knows nothing whatever about how the “final text” (which implies a preliminary text)
      was approved, and still less about “corrections” made by anyone. In fact, not to put a fine point on it, his
      statement about these unknown corrections and approvals is pure fiction. To this fiction he adds the footnoted
      statement that
    </div>

    <div class="bq" id="notee--74">
      there is no doubt that this document did not express the private opinion of Marx and Engels but rather the
      compromise accepted by the various factions of the League.
    </div>

    <div class="noindentt" id="notee--75">
      This utter absence of doubt about this fantasy is based on a single remarkable argument which we will see. But we
      now discern the claim: <a id="page_603" class="calibre6"></a>the March Address “did not express the private opinion of Marx and
      Engels” but rather an opinion which they simply wrote down as amanuenses for “various factions,” with which they
      presumably disagreed. Nicolaievsky is trying to say that the views of the March Address are to be assigned to
      Willich and Schapper, and were not held by Marx and Engels even when the document was sent out.
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="notee--77">
      This would be a breathtaking scenario to support even if there were a bit of evidence. It will be seen as
      impressively divine when we find out that there is no evidence at all. To be sure, Nicolaievsky’s fantasy is the
      <em id="notee--78" class="calibre8">ne plus ultra</em> of marxology on this problem; but the facts also expose the milder myth
      that Marx and Engels subsequently repudiated the views they held in 1850.
    </div>

    <h3 class="h3a" id="noteelev2">2. THE LINEUP IN THE SEPTEMBER 1850 SPLIT</h3>

    <div class="indent" id="notee--80">
      Since the myth about the “Blanquist aberration” in the March Address was not invented until after the authors’
      death,<a id="noteeen2-r" class="calibre6"></a><a class="nounder1" id="notee--82" href="43.html#noteeen2">*</a> they had no occasion
      to confront it directly. But their several back-references to the 1850 document are sufficient to demolish the
      myth.
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="notee--83">
      We can begin with the same Communist League split discussion of September 15, 1850, which is supposed to show
      Marx repudiating the March Address. If this were so (leaving aside a content analysis of the claim) we should
      hardly expect to find Marx explicitly flaunting the Address, along with the Manifesto, as his programmatic
      banner. Furthermore, the myth has it, and must have it, that the Address really represented the program of the
      Willich-Schapper faction against Marx. We should then hardly expect that, at this meeting, it is Marx who is
      <a id="page_604" class="calibre6"></a>defending the Address <em id="notee--85" class="calibre8">against Willich-Schapper.</em> But even the sketchy
      extant minutes show this very clearly.
    </div>

    <div class="indentb" id="notee--86">
      The very passage from Marx’s speech which is supposed to contradict the Address is introduced by Marx with these
      words:
    </div>

    <div class="bq" id="notee--87">
      In just the last debate over the question of “the position of the German proletariat in the next revolution,”
      views were expressed by members of the [Willich-Schapper] Minority of the C.C. that directly contradict the
      next-to-the-last circular [the March Address], and even the Manifesto.<sup id="notee--88" class="calibre13"><a id="noteefn16" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="notee--90" href="39_split_001.html#noteefn16-r">16</a></sup>
    </div>

    <div class="noindentt" id="notee--91">
      It is the Willich-Schapper faction, Marx argues, that is repudiating the March Address. It is this that leads him
      to explain that “Instead of the actual conditions, <em id="notee--92" class="calibre8">pure will</em> becomes the drive-wheel of
      the revolution for them,” and so on.<sup id="notee--93" class="calibre13"><a id="noteefn17" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="notee--95" href="39_split_001.html#noteefn17-r">17</a></sup> This speech is the opposite of a repudiation: it is explicitly presented
      by Marx as a defense of the Address as well as of the Manifesto.
    </div>

    <div class="indentb" id="notee--96">
      The debate, Marx went on to say, shows what “principled differences” are at stake, for although the
      Willich-Schapper people still consider themselves communists, “the views they are now expressing are
      anti-communist and could at most be called social-democratic.”<sup id="notee--97" class="calibre13"><a id="noteefn18" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="notee--99" href="39_split_001.html#noteefn18-r">18</a></sup> Schapper then took the floor, and showed that he
      repudiated the concept of permanent revolution in favor of the Blanquist type of direct seizure of power by the
      “proletariat” (alias the Communist League) without any intervening phase of any kind.<sup id="notee--100" class="calibre13"><a id="noteefn19" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="notee--102" href="39_split_001.html#noteefn19-r">19</a></sup>
    </div>

    <div class="bq" id="notee--103">
      The question at issue [said Schapper] is whether at the outset we chop off heads or get our own heads chopped
      off. In France the workers will have their turn and thereupon so will <em id="notee--104" class="calibre8">we</em> in Germany. If
      this were not the case, then it is true I would lay me down to sleep … Comes our turn, then we can take such
      measures as to ensure power for the proletariat. I am fanatical about this view. The Central Committee, however,
      has resolved on the opposite. … I do not hold the opinion that the bourgeois will come to power in Germany, and I
      am a fanatical enthusiast in this respect; were I not, I wouldn’t give a farthing for the whole business.<sup id="notee--105" class="calibre13"><a id="noteefn20" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="notee--107" href="39_split_001.html#noteefn20-r">20</a></sup>
    </div>

    <div class="noindentt" id="notee--108">
      This is the viewpoint that demands an immediate proletarian revolution with no first stage.
    </div>

    <div class="indentb" id="notee--109">
      To this, Marx, in rebuttal, counterposed his view of the permanent revolution in its last version as embodied in
      the March Address. The petty-bourgeois Democracy will take power next time, and the Communists will go into
      opposition to the new regime, in order to press the revolution on to proletarian power. Schapper is looking
      forward to <em id="notee--110" class="calibre8">being</em> <a id="page_605" class="calibre6"></a>the government, Marx is aiming to <em id="notee--112" class="calibre8">oppose</em> the government.<a id="noteeen3-r" class="calibre6"></a><a class="nounder1" id="notee--114" href="43.html#noteeen3">*</a> Schapper’s perspective of forming a “proletarian” government at the outset will be
      self-defeating, argued Marx:
    </div>

    <div class="bq" id="notee--115">
      If the proletariat came to power, it would not take directly proletarian measures but petty-bourgeois ones. Our
      party can become the government only when conditions allow it to put <em id="notee--116" class="calibre8">its own</em> outlook
      into effect. Louis Blanc offers the best example of how you fare when you come to power too early. Anyway, in
      France it is not the proletarians alone that will come to power but along with them the peasants and
      petty-bourgeois, and it is not their own measures but the <em id="notee--117" class="calibre8">latter’s</em> that they will have
      to put into effect. The Commune of Paris [1792-1794] shows that you don’t need to be in the government in order
      to put something into effect. Anyway, why don’t any of the other members of the Minority express their views,
      especially Citizen Willich, since at the time they all unanimously approved the [March] circular?<sup id="notee--118" class="calibre13"><a id="noteefn22" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="notee--120" href="39_split_001.html#noteefn22-r">22</a></sup>
    </div>

    <div class="noindenttb" id="notee--121">
      So goes the summary of Marx’s argument in the minutes. The last sentence shows Marx for the second time flaunting
      the March Address as his own programmatic position <em id="notee--122" class="calibre8">against</em> Willich-Schapper. And
      incidentally the passing reference in this sentence to the unanimous approval of the March Address when it was
      adopted should be matched against the Nicolaievskian invention of a fictional controversy in which
      Willich-Schapper made “corrections.”
    </div>

    <h3 class="h3a" id="noteelev3">3. THE ADDRESS AND THE COLOGNE TRIAL</h3>

    <div class="indentb" id="notee--124">
      Following this split, Marx and his followers transferred the League’s Central Committee out of London to Cologne.
      In December, the Cologne committee sent out a circular (an Address) which gives us more information about the
      authorship of the March Address and its relation to the Willich-Schapper group. The Cologne people denounced the
      Willich-Schapper position as “based on principles that are diametrically opposed to the principles of the League”
      and to the policies followed.<sup id="notee--125" class="calibre13"><a id="noteefn23" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="notee--127" href="39_split_001.html#noteefn23-r">23</a></sup> <a id="page_606" class="calibre6"></a>The Willich-Schapper attack, they told the members, was
      not directed against some kind of “bourgeois socialism”; on the contrary—

    <div class="bq" id="notee--129">
      it damned the authors of the party Manifesto of 1848 and of the first “Address of the Central Committee” of this
      year [the March Address], in which the policies of the party are expounded in detail; indeed, it also condemned
      the <em id="notee--130" class="calibre8">Manifesto and the policies of the party itself</em>.<sup id="notee--131" class="calibre13"><a id="noteefn24" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="notee--133" href="39_split_001.html#noteefn24-r">24</a></sup>
    </div>

    <div class="noindentt" id="notee--134">
      The Cologne leaders assume everyone knows that the “authors” of the March Address as well as of the Manifesto
      were Marx and Engels, and furthermore that the Willich-Schapper group condemned these political statements as
      well as their authors.
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="notee--135">
      The Cologne circular then goes on to expound the programmatic difference between the two sides, and it introduces
      Marx’s standpoint with these words: “the Manifesto and the [March] Address set out the course of development of
      the proletarian movement as follows …” Once again these two documents are coupled as expressing Marx’s position
      counterposed to Willich-Schapper’s. It is true that Marx thought the Cologne circular, which had been drafted by
      Heinrich Bürgers, was not a competent political exposition, but there is no question about the clarity with which
      it reports the relation of the Address to the ongoing fight.
    </div>

    <div class="indentb" id="notee--136">
      While the factions were arguing, reaction had consolidated itself in Germany and cast about for a “Communist
      conspiracy” to expose in order to send the German public scurrying to the Crown for protection from the Red
      Menace. In May 1851 a police raid started preparations for a conspiracy trial; documents were seized; the trial
      itself was to get under way in October 1852. Thus, for the first time the March Address was published in the
      German bourgeois press, in June 1851. The immediate problem raised by its publication was the effect it might
      have on the coming trial of Communist League members, as well as its general political meaning for the public.
      Marx wrote to Engels to tell him about the publication of the document:
    </div>

    <div class="bq" id="notee--137">
      This was the “Address to the League” written by the two of us<a id="noteeen4-r" class="calibre6"></a><a class="nounder1" id="notee--139" href="43.html#noteeen4">*</a>—at bottom nothing but a plan of war against the Democracy. From one
      standpoint its publication was good, in contrast with Bürgers’ document [the Cologne committee’s circular] which
      is more or less absurd in form and not very cheering in content. On the other hand, a few passages will aggravate
      the situation of the present prisoners.<sup id="notee--140" class="calibre13"><a id="noteefn26" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="notee--142" href="39_split_001.html#noteefn26-r">26</a></sup>
    </div>

    <div class="noindentb" id="notee--143">
      <a id="page_607" class="calibre6"></a>The “True Socialist” Karl Grün had utilized the publication of the Address for a roundhouse
      attack on the Marx group, anticipating marxologists by several decades. In his letter to Engels, Marx ruefully
      summarized Griin’s absurdities:
    </div>

    <div class="bq" id="notee--145">
      There is naturally no lack of Friends of Light phrases and most extremely “anarchistic” phrases.<sup id="notee--146" class="calibre13"><a id="noteefn27" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="notee--148" href="39_split_001.html#noteefn27-r">27</a></sup>

    </div>

    <div class="noindenttb" id="notee--153">
      But while Marx was outraged by the slanderous invention of views that resembled nothing in the Address, his
      correspondence with Engels shows them both to be unquestioningly in accord with what <em id="notee--154" class="calibre8">is</em>
      in the document. Engels’ reply referred to “our old document” just as casually as Marx’s letter.<sup id="notee--155" class="calibre13"><a id="noteefn29" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="notee--157" href="39_split_001.html#noteefn29-r">29</a></sup> He
      too was concerned in the first place with its possible impact on the defendants in Cologne; otherwise he praises
      the Address as an educational document:
    </div>

    <div class="bq" id="notee--158">
      … in every respect it is of enormous advantage that the thing has been made public and has gone about through all
      the papers. The individual quiet bands of budding Communists, who are not known at all and who must be meeting in
      all parts of Germany judging by past experience, will get an excellent point of support in it…
    </div>

    <div class="noindentt" id="notee--159">
      The <em id="notee--160" class="calibre8">Augsburger Allgemeine Zeitung</em> (Marx had reported) had editorially denounced the
      Address as “madness! madness!” but Engels comments wryly that the paper’s account of its content “shows it
      understood this ‘madness’ only too well—in fact there was no way to misunderstand it.”<sup id="notee--161" class="calibre13"><a id="noteefn30" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="notee--163" href="39_split_001.html#noteefn30-r">30</a></sup>
    </div>

    <div class="indentb" id="notee--164">
      Johannes Miquel—still presumably a Communist sympathizer and not yet the kaiser’s minister—had expressed the fear
      to Marx that the publication of the Address would have an unfavorable effect on the Democracy. Engels discusses
      this fear, minimizing the difference between the newly published document and the attacks on the Democracy that
      they had published in bulk in the <em id="notee--165" class="calibre8">N.R.Z.</em>
    </div>

    <div class="bq" id="notee--166">
      Miquel should however consider that we continuously and uninterruptedly prosecuted these gentlemen [the
      Democracy] in writings that were more or less party manifestos after all.
    </div>

    <div class="noindentb" id="notee--167">
      Engels is thus clearly unimpressed by the fact that the Address differs from the <em id="notee--168" class="calibre8">N.R.Z.</em>
      articles in being an official document of the League. He continues:
    </div>

    <div class="bq" id="notee--169">
      So now, why the outcry over a program that simply summarizes, in a very calm and especially quite impersonal way,
      what we <a id="page_608" class="calibre6"></a>printed long ago? … Any halfway intelligent Democrat must have known in advance what
      he had to expect from our party—the document [March Address] could not have told him much that was new. If they
      made an alliance pro tempore with the Communists, they were fully informed of the conditions and duration of the
      alliance, and it could occur to nobody but Hanoverian middle peasants and lawyers to believe that since 1850 the
      Communists had been converted from the principles and policies of the <em id="notee--171" class="calibre8">Neue Rheinische

    <h3 class="h2" id="noteelev4">4. THE ADDRESS FROM 1852 TO 1885</h3>

    <div class="indent" id="notee--179">
      Marx spent the last months of 1852 working on his pamphlet <em id="notee--180" class="calibre8">Revelations on the Communist Trial
      in Cologne</em>, which is mainly an exposé of the evidence used by the prosecution against the Communist League
      defendants. It is a defense pamphlet, not a political manifesto, and treats the documents accordingly. Published
      in January, the pamphlet has only a passing reference to the “confiscated Addresses of the Central Committee”
      along a line foreshadowed in the Marx-Engels correspondence: the addresses, it argues, “were concerned
      exclusively with the relations of the Communists to the future government of the Democracy, hence not to the
      government of Friedrich Wilhelm IV.”<sup id="notee--181" class="calibre13"><a id="noteefn33" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="notee--183" href="39_split_001.html#noteefn33-r">33</a></sup>
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="notee--184">
      Most significant for our purposes is what is not in the <em id="notee--185" class="calibre8">Revelations.</em> The government had
      seized many documents of the Willich-Schapper league, filled with enough inflammatory pseudorevolutionary
      rhetoric to delight a police prosecutor’s heart; and, since none of the defendants belonged to this group, the
      prosecution systematically sought to argue that Willich-Schapper documents applied just as much to the Marx
      group, the differences being merely due to a clash of personalities. Naturally, the defendants, as well as Marx
      in the <em id="notee--186" class="calibre8">Revelations</em>, repudiated <a id="page_609" class="calibre6"></a>not only the documents of the
      Willich-Schapper league but also separated themselves vigorously from its conceptions, on a carefully political
      basis. If there was anything to the marxological myth that the March Address represented the politics of
      Willich-Schapper and not of Marx, then the <em id="notee--188" class="calibre8">Revelations</em> was the place to reveal it, as a
      means of helping to clear the defendants. But of course there was no question of this.
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="notee--189">
      Toward the end of 1853, Marx again had to deal with Willich, who had been publishing slanderous attacks on Marx
      in his American exile. Marx’s polemic against Willich, <em id="notee--190" class="calibre8">The Knight of the Noble
      Consciousness</em>, was published at the beginning of 1854, and is now as justly forgotten as the writings of its
      target. But it has a definitive reference to the authorship of the March Address. More than that, just as he did
      on September 15, 1850, Marx here presents the Address as his own <em id="notee--191" class="calibre8">as against Willich.</em>
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="notee--192">
      In the <em id="notee--193" class="calibre8">Revelations</em> Marx had remarked of the Willich-Schapper group that they “have never
      laid claim to the honor of possessing their own ideas. What is true of them is their peculiar misunderstanding of
      other people’s ideas …”<sup id="notee--194" class="calibre13"><a id="noteefn34" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="notee--196" href="39_split_001.html#noteefn34-r">34</a></sup>
    </div>

    <div class="noindentb" id="notee--197">
      In the new pamphlet Marx reported that Willich had tried to show the public he did have a stock of his own ideas:
      he had presented an exposition of the measures that the petty-bourgeois Democracy would undertake in power. This
      exposition, Marx then explained, though it was an attempt to write something original, was really cribbed—from
      the March Address by Marx and Engels.
    </div>

    <div class="bq" id="notee--198">
      In a circular written by Engels and myself, which the Saxon police seized at Bürgers’ house, which was published
      in the most widely read German papers and formed the basis for the Cologne bill of indictment, there is a longer
      exposition on the pious aspirations of the German petty-bourgeoisie. This is the text on which Willich preaches
      his sermon. Let the reader compare the original and the copy.<sup id="notee--199" class="calibre13"><a id="noteefn35" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="notee--201" href="39_split_001.html#noteefn35-r">35</a></sup>
    </div>

    <div class="noindentt" id="notee--202">
      If that does not settle it, there is more.
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="notee--203">
      A couple of decades later, the German party republished Marx’s <em id="notee--204" class="calibre8">Revelations on the Cologne
      Communist Trial</em>, as a note on a historical episode. To this 1875 edition Marx added a Postscript; since he
      had decided not to omit anything from the text, he pointed to whatever he thought needed special comment in the
      old pamphlet. Some of the corrections are of minutiae.<sup id="notee--205" class="calibre13"><a id="noteefn36" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="notee--207" href="39_split_001.html#noteefn36-r">36</a></sup> This was an opportunity also to correct the
      references to the March Address—if there were anything to correct. There is no correction.
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="notee--208">
      Ten years later a third edition of the <em id="notee--209" class="calibre8">Revelations</em> was published. Marx dead, Engels
      wrote a considerable introduction, “On the History <a id="page_610" class="calibre6"></a>of the Communist League,” which duly
      mentions the authorship of the March Address. <em id="notee--211" class="calibre8">And in addition, in the appendix to this 1885
      edition, Engels reprinted the whole text of the March Address for the edification of the new generation of
      socialists.</em> In fact, it is from this reprint by Engels that the text of the Address is usually republished
      today.
    </div>

    <div class="indentb" id="notee--212">
      In the body of the essay Engels introduces the reprint as follows:
    </div>

    <div class="bqi" id="notee--213">
      So the League was organized anew, the Address of March 1850—printed in the appendix, IX, no. 1—was issued, and
      Heinrich Bauer was sent to Germany as emissary. The Address drawn up [<em id="notee--214" class="calibre8">redigierte</em>] by
      Marx and myself is still of interest today, because even now the petty-bourgeois Democracy in Germany is still
      the party that must certainly come to the helm to begin with, as the savior of society from the communist workers
      on the occasion of the next European upheaval, which is now due soon … Much of what is said in it therefore holds
      good today.<sup id="notee--215" class="calibre13"><a id="noteefn37" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="notee--217" href="39_split_001.html#noteefn37-r">37</a></sup>
    </div>

    <div class="indentt" id="notee--218">
      It would appear that this settles the question for good and all, or rather adds the final capstone to the
      peculiar controversy—not only as to the authorship of the Address but also as to the continuing regard in which
      Marx and Engels held it, with due qualification for the fact that it was written for a specific historical
      conjuncture. For a third of a century, in <em id="notee--219" class="calibre8">every</em> reference to the Address, public or
      private, Marx and Engels had claimed authorship and continuing responsibility. Nowhere and by no one had this
      even been called into question.
    </div>

    <h3 class="h2" id="noteelev5">5. ADVENTURE IN LEXICOGRAPHY</h3>

    <div class="indent" id="notee--221">
      But what is plain to ordinary minds is only a challenge to the ingenious. So what if Marx and Engels had set down
      more than a half dozen times that they had <em id="notee--222" class="calibre8">written</em> the March Address? Now, forty-five
      years afterward, in the very act of reprinting the document, Engels says that the Address was <em id="notee--223" class="calibre8">redigierte</em> by Marx and himself. If you look up <em id="notee--224" class="calibre8">redigieren</em> in a German,
      or German-English, dictionary, you will find that it means <em id="notee--225" class="calibre8">edit, revise.</em> The truth is
      finally out: Marx and Engels only <em id="notee--226" class="calibre8">edited</em> the address, but were not its authors! Armed
      with what they think is the dictionary meaning of <em id="notee--227" class="calibre8">redigieren</em>, valiant writers have found
      it possible to ignore all other evidence.
    </div>

    <div class="indentb" id="notee--228">
      We can now present the whole of Nicolaievsky’s statement on the issue, of which we previously quoted a sentence:
    </div>

    <div class="bq" id="notee--229">
      I am not raising here the question of the authorship of this “Appeal” [the March Address] but I must point out
      that it can <a id="page_611" class="calibre6"></a>be attributed to Marx and Engels only with important reservations. True, in his
      letter to Engels of July 13, 1851, Marx refers to it as “drafted by both of us.”<a id="noteeen6-r" class="calibre6"></a><a class="nounder1" id="notee--232" href="43.html#noteeen6">*</a> However, in his article, <em id="notee--233" class="calibre8">A
      contribution to the history of the Communist League</em>, Engels is much more circumspect, speaking only of the
      <em id="notee--234" class="calibre8">editing</em> of this document by himself and Marx. However this may be, there is no doubt
      that this document did not express the private opinion of Marx and Engels but rather the compromise accepted by
      the various factions of the League.<sup id="notee--235" class="calibre13"><a id="noteefn38" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="notee--237" href="39_split_001.html#noteefn38-r">38</a></sup>
    </div>

    <div class="noindentt" id="notee--238">
      Thus, after explaining that he is “not raising” the question of authorship, he marshals the evidence for his
      doubt-free conclusion that the document written down by Marx and Engels did not express their “private opinion.”
      This evidence can be found in any desk dictionary: the dictionary meaning of <em id="notee--239" class="calibre8">redigieren</em>,
      which Nicolaievsky thinks means only <em id="notee--240" class="calibre8">edit.</em>
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="notee--241">
      Before we dispose of this evidence, we may mention two reasons why a doubt should have crept in anyway, even
      aside from all the preceding statements by Marx and Engels. In the first place, he might have wondered why Engels
      in 1885 reprinted a document which he and Marx had merely edited, without agreeing with it. In the second place,
      he might have wondered whether Engels was using <em id="notee--242" class="calibre8">redigieren</em> according to his desk
      dictionary.
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="notee--243">
      The German <em id="notee--244" class="calibre8">redigieren</em> is a foreign loan-word related to the French <em id="notee--245" class="calibre8">rédiger.</em> (As a matter of fact, it probably entered the language in the sixteenth century from
      the Italian <em id="notee--246" class="calibre8">redigere</em>, but by the nineteenth its French cognate would have more force for
      a writer.) In French, <em id="notee--247" class="calibre8">rédiger</em> had—and still has—a range of meaning extending from
      <em id="notee--248" class="calibre8">edit</em> (a paper), <em id="notee--249" class="calibre8">draw up</em> (a document), <em id="notee--250" class="calibre8">draft</em> (an article), to <em id="notee--251" class="calibre8">write, write out</em>. True, our doubts would remind
      us that Engels was not writing French, but the objection is not as relevant as it may seem. Especially in the
      nineteenth century, much writing by literary Germans was peppered with Gallicisms which did not necessarily show
      up in the dictionary. Marx’s predilection for foreignisms in German was notoriously even greater than Engels’ and
      much deplored by his German editors. Heinrich Heine was an even more prominent case, having spent the last
      quarter century of his life in French exile; but then, Engels had lived abroad much longer than that. In any
      case, at the time there would have been nothing unusual about Engels’ use of <em id="notee--252" class="calibre8">redigieren</em>
      in the sense of the French <em id="notee--253" class="calibre8">rédiger</em> even if the Gallicized usage were not sanctioned by a
      <a id="page_612" class="calibre6"></a>dictionary. All this should raise doubts even without further research.
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="notee--255">
      But as a matter of fact <em id="notee--256" class="calibre8">redigieren</em> is not one of the unsanctioned cases. To extend
      research a little beyond the nearest desk dictionary, Nicolaievsky should have checked at least the nineteenth
      century <em id="notee--257" class="calibre8">Fremdwörterbücher</em>, German dictionaries of foreignisms. At the time Engels
      reprinted the March Address, many such works were authoritatively defining <em id="notee--258" class="calibre8">redigieren</em> as
      <em id="notee--259" class="calibre8">draft</em> and <em id="notee--260" class="calibre8">write</em> in addition to <em id="notee--261" class="calibre8">edit,
      revise.</em> I counted nine such authorities before I quit looking.<sup id="notee--262" class="calibre13"><a id="noteefn39" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="notee--264" href="39_split_001.html#noteefn39-r">39</a></sup> In point of fact,
      Engels’ statement that the Address was <em id="notee--265" class="calibre8">redigierte</em> by Marx and himself does not even
      offer lexicographical difficulties.
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="notee--266">
      So there is no doubt (as Nicolaievsky would say) that the Address is just what it purports to be and what Marx
      and Engels always said it was—an expression of the views of Marx and Engels, which <em id="notee--267" class="calibre8">mutatis
      mutandum</em> continued to reflect their political thought right up to the end: no probable, possible shadow of
      doubt, no possible doubt whatever.
