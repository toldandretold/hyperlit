    <h2 class="h1" id="ch06"><a id="page_147" class="calibre4"></a>6 THE PRINCIPLE OF CLASS SELF-EMANCIPATION</h2>

    <div class="indent" id="ch06--2">
      We have emphasized in several ways that Marx’s socialism was above all a <em id="ch06--3" class="calibre8">class socialism—</em>a
      theory about the social struggle of a class, embedded in a theory of societal dynamics—and that this is what was
      unique about it. The main difficulty with grasping this notion is that it appears to be so simple and
      transparent, when in fact it is neither—as the history of Marxist sects proved while Marx and Engels were still
      alive. The same is true of another famous phrase associated with their class socialism: <em id="ch06--4" class="calibre8">the
      self-emancipation of the proletariat.</em>
    </div>

    <h3 class="h2" id="ch06lev1">1. FROM CHARTISM TO THE INTERNATIONAL</h3>

    <div class="indent" id="ch06--6">
      Praise for the idea of self-emancipation is usually as obligatory as hatred of sin, respect for motherhood, and
      hopes for the Good Life. Only a certain British aristocratic household has dared to revel in the family motto,
      “<em id="ch06--7" class="calibre8">Tout d’en haut,”</em> which describes the practical politics of the world.<sup id="ch06--8" class="calibre13"><a id="ch06fn1" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch06--10" href="39_split_000.html#ch06fn1-r">1</a></sup> Like all
      laudable aspirations, talk of self-emancipation goes back very far—it was probably already well known in Olduvai
      Gorge—especially under the label of <em id="ch06--11" class="calibre8">self-help.</em> The inculcation of self-help has always
      been popular among the people who would otherwise be obliged to provide the help, and who therefore easily
      recognize it as a virtue of the poor. In England the bourgeoisie made a contribution of this sort to legitimizing
      the idea of self-emancipation among the working classes.
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="ch06--12">
      The literature of the Chartist movement fused self-emancipation with the idea of political struggle. The
      principle of self-emancipation, as <a id="page_148" class="calibre6"></a>an invocation to rely only on proletarian forces for
      proletarian goals, was a platitude in the Chartist movement, above all on the left, while Marx was still in
      school. It did not take a Marx to invent it; on the contrary, it probably arose spontaneously out of the facts of
      class mistrust, wherever the pattern of the class struggle enforced its lessons. It gave rise to attitudes
      repudiating the sanctity of charity, the Lord-is-my-shepherd hosannas, fidelity to the Master, and a host of
      other virtues beloved of ruling classes: “To us there is nothing so hateful, so detestable, so offensive, as a
      patronising, mendacious magnanimity,” wrote an English workers’ paper.<sup id="ch06--14" class="calibre13"><a id="ch06fn2" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch06--16" href="39_split_000.html#ch06fn2-r">2</a></sup>
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="ch06--17">
      The idea of self-emancipation was so common in the Chartist left that it is easy to suppose that the German
      émigrés in its midst heard it as often as anyone, as well as knowing all the German self-help saws. A few months
      before the <em id="ch06--18" class="calibre8">Communist Manifesto</em>, Marx’s associate Wilhelm Wolff wrote an article in the
      Communist League’s paper in which he exhorted: “in truth no one will or can free us proletarians if we do not do
      it <em id="ch06--19" class="calibre8">ourselves.”</em> Typically he introduced this with a German proverb, “<em id="ch06--20" class="calibre8">Selbst ist der Mann</em>” (roughly: Let George do it but you yourself are George), which breathes the
      old air of self-help.<sup id="ch06--21" class="calibre13"><a id="ch06fn3" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch06--23" href="39_split_000.html#ch06fn3-r">3</a></sup>
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="ch06--24">
      So when Marx wrote the aphoristic formulation of the principle into the first clause of the International’s
      <em id="ch06--25" class="calibre8">Rules:</em>

    <div class="bqi" id="ch06--26">

      it was the embodiment of a long-standing and widely used idea, though it is from this source that the formula
      became so famous that it was repeated by various elements who did not believe a word of it. This use also gave it
      sufficient prominence to come to the attention of academic historians of socialism who had no idea what it meant.
      Thus, the eminent Belgian historian Emile de Laveleye—one of those who, Engels rightly remarked, spread nothing
      but “lies and legends” about the history of the International<sup id="ch06--31" class="calibre13"><a id="ch06fn5" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch06--33" href="39_split_000.html#ch06fn5-r">5</a></sup>—wrote in 1881, in a much republished book:
    </div>

    <div class="bq" id="ch06--34">
      The International also affirmed that “the emancipation of the laborers must be the work of the laborers
      themselves.” This idea seemed an application of the principle of “self-help”; it enlisted for the new
      association, even in France, the sympathies of many distinguished men who little suspected how it was to be
      interpreted later on. This affords a new proof of the fact, frequently <a id="page_149" class="calibre6"></a>observed, that
      revolutionary movements always go on increasing in violence. The originators of the movement… are replaced by the
      more fanatical, who, in their turn, are pushed aside, until the final abyss is reached to which wild
      revolutionary logic inevitably leads.<sup id="ch06--36" class="calibre13"><a id="ch06fn6" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch06--38" href="39_split_000.html#ch06fn6-r">6</a></sup>
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="ch06--39">
      In contrast to this learned liberal, the reactionary historian of the International, Villetard, understood very
      quickly that the militants of the International were so wildly fanatical as to believe exactly what the principle
      of self-emancipation said. “No idea, without excepting perhaps their hatred of capital,” he charged, “entered
      more passionately into their heads and hearts.” He quotes a French militant of the International who expressed
      these heinous sentiments: “We have proclaimed … that we no longer wanted deliverers, that we no longer wished to
      serve as instruments …”<sup id="ch06--40" class="calibre13"><a id="ch06fn7" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch06--42" href="39_split_000.html#ch06fn7-r">7</a></sup>
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="ch06--43">
      The principle of self-emancipation figured not only in the Rules of the International but also on the back of the
      individual’s membership card, where it led off the brief statement of principles condensed from the
      Rules.<sup id="ch06--44" class="calibre13"><a id="ch06fn8" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch06--46" href="39_split_000.html#ch06fn8-r">8</a></sup> Documents of the International not written by Marx or Engels freely appealed to
      the same concept.<a id="ch06en1-r" class="calibre6"></a><a class="nounder1" id="ch06--48" href="43.html#ch06en1">*</a> It must be
      remarked, however, that in two cases that come easily to hand the concept is seen emerging from the old self-help
      idea like Michelangelo’s “Prisoners” from the rough marble. Thus, an address calling for an independent labor
      press drafted by some members of the General Council started with Poor Richard himself: “Benjamin Franklin is
      reported to have said, ‘If you want a thing done, and well done, do it yourself,’ and this is precisely what we
      must do … we must take the work of salvation into our own hands …”<sup id="ch06--49" class="calibre13"><a id="ch06fn12" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch06--51" href="39_split_000.html#ch06fn12-r">12</a></sup> And the Address of the
      Land and Labour League, which historian Royden Harrison thinks was partly written <a id="page_150" class="calibre6"></a>under the
      influence of Marx, exhorts: “There is one, and only one, remedy. Help yourselves.”<sup id="ch06--53" class="calibre13"><a id="ch06fn13" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch06--55" href="39_split_000.html#ch06fn13-r">13</a></sup>
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="ch06--56">
      Later on, Engels rightly predated the conception to “the very beginning,” before it had been adopted in the
      International: “our notion, from the very beginning, was that ‘the emancipation of the working class must be the
      act of the working class itself,’” he wrote in a preface to the <em id="ch06--57" class="calibre8">Communist
      Manifesto.</em><sup id="ch06--58" class="calibre13"><a id="ch06fn14" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch06--60" href="39_split_000.html#ch06fn14-r">14</a></sup> (This varies slightly the canonical formulation, as did Marx in another
      work.)<sup id="ch06--61" class="calibre13"><a id="ch06fn15" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch06--63" href="39_split_000.html#ch06fn15-r">15</a></sup> The <em id="ch06--64" class="calibre8">very</em> beginning has already been described in our

      before their own programmatic ideas had crystallized. The context indicates that Engels was thinking of the
      period around 1847 when the Manifesto was in preparation.

    <h3 class="h2" id="ch06lev2">2. THE SIN OF CHARITY</h3>

    <div class="indent" id="ch06--69">
      By 1847 (as far as we can make out from published articles) the idea of self-emancipation merged in Marx’s
      thinking with his view of the class struggle as the crux of socialist policy. The resultant fusion was expressed
      several times that year by both Marx and Engels. The immediate target was the bourgeoisie’s best known
      alternative to working-class struggle. To be sure, all alternatives offered by society were efforts to convince
      the people that they need not act for themselves—“but the greatest of these is charity.”
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="ch06--70">
      Peter had explained it long ago: “for charity shall cover the multitude of sins.” It had also been explained in
      the Old Testament: “For the poor shall never cease out of the land: <em id="ch06--71" class="calibre8">therefore</em> I command
      thee, saying, Thou shalt open thine hands wide …”<sup id="ch06--72" class="calibre13"><a id="ch06fn17" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch06--74" href="39_split_000.html#ch06fn17-r">17</a></sup>The holy injunction is given a very practical reason, we see.
      This sociological strategy of Christianity has often been the butt of radicals’ denunciation. Marx took his turn
      in 1847, in a burst of indignation at a pious Prussian who <a id="page_151" class="calibre6"></a>had sermonized that “If only
      those whose calling it is to develop the social principles of Christianity do so, the Communists will soon be put
      to silence.” Marx replied with some passion:
    </div>

    <div class="indentt" id="ch06--76">
      The social principles of Christianity have now had eighteen hundred years to develop and need no further
      development by Prussian Consistorial Councillors.
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="ch06--77">
      The social principles of Christianity have justified the slavery of antiquity and glorified medieval serfdom, and
      in case of need likewise acquiesce in defending the oppression of the proletariat, even though putting a doleful
      face on it.
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="ch06--78">
      The social principles of Christianity preach the necessity of a ruling and an oppressed class, and all they have

      The social principles of Christianity assign the Consistorial compensation for all infamies to heaven and thereby

      The social principles of Christianity declare all vile acts of oppressors against the oppressed to be either just

      treated as <em id="ch06--83" class="calibre8">canaille</em>, has need of its courage, its self-reliance, its pride and its sense

      the idea of the philanthropic bourgeois that it is only a question of providing a little bread and a little

      But Engels had so far outdone him in this line. In <em id="ch06--99" class="calibre8">The Condition of the Working Class in
      England</em> Engels had authentically reflected the <a id="page_152" class="calibre6"></a>English left’s attack on the charity
      system—“your self-complacent, Pharisaic philanthropy” which gives the victims a hundredth part of what has been
      plundered from their labor:

    <div class="bq" id="ch06--101">
      Charity which degrades him who gives more than him who takes; charity which treads the downtrodden still deeper
      in the dust, which demands that the degraded, the pariah cast out by society, shall first surrender the last that
      remains to him, his very claim to manhood, shall first beg for mercy before your mercy deigns to press, in the
      shape of an alms, the brand of degradation upon his brow.<sup id="ch06--102" class="calibre13"><a id="ch06fn21" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch06--104" href="39_split_000.html#ch06fn21-r">21</a></sup>
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="ch06--105">
      By 1847 Engels was more inclined to put it politically, as when he attacked the French moderate republicans for
      their program of restricted democracy which emphasized “philanthropic charity” instead: “measures of pure
      charity, that is, measures to soften down the revolutionary energies of the proletarians.” Welfare charity “is
      far from being based upon fraternity, whilst at the same time it is an insolent and very impotent denial of
      equality.”<sup id="ch06--106" class="calibre13"><a id="ch06fn22" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch06--108" href="39_split_000.html#ch06fn22-r">22</a></sup> Such sentiments were familiar in the Chartist organ that published this
      article, but less so in the German paper which, about the same time, published his long criticism of the
      literature of the then prominent “True Socialist” tendency. This starts with a thrust at one Karl Beck’s “Songs
      of the Poor Man,” which begins with a poem addressed to the House of Rothschild.
    </div>

    <div class="bqi" id="ch06--109">
      It is not the destruction of Rothschild’s real power or the social conditions on which it is based that the poet
      threatens; no, he wishes only it should be used in a humanitarian way. He laments that the bankers are not
      socialistic philanthropists, not sentimental visionaries, not benefactors of humanity, but just bankers. Beck
      sings the praises of this cowardly, petty-bourgeois <em id="ch06--110" class="calibre8">misère</em>, of the “poor man,” the
      <em id="ch06--111" class="calibre8">pauvre honteux</em>, with his poor, pious and contradictory desires, the “little man” in all

      of the bourgeois among themselves; it counsels the workers to be sober, to work hard and to have few children; it

      categories which express bourgeois relations, without the antagonism which constitutes them and is inseparable
      from them. They think they are seriously fighting bourgeois practice, and they are more bourgeois than the

      A little further the Manifesto points out that utopian socialism, despite its positive “critical” content, tends
      to degenerate into this kind of socialism too. “Only from the point of view of being the most suffering class
      does the proletariat exist for them.” And “the proletariat, as yet in its infancy, offers to them the spectacle
      of a class without any historical initiative or any independent political movement.” In contrast, the Manifesto’s
      message is that the proletarian movement is “the self-conscious, independent movement of the immense majority, in
      the interests of the immense majority.”<sup id="ch06--133" class="calibre13"><a id="ch06fn26" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch06--135" href="39_split_000.html#ch06fn26-r">26</a></sup>

      Only a movement of the immense majority, in its own interests, could be a movement of self-emancipation. This
      moves out of the sphere of charity versus self-help, to become a basic determinant of the nature of socialism.

    <div class="indent" id="ch06--138">
      The principle of self-emancipation has this in common with the Golden Rule, that it is venerated as a maxim and
      violated to the maximum. Just as literal adherence to the Golden Rule would bring <a id="page_154" class="calibre6"></a>down
      present-day society, so conformity with the self-emancipation principle would dissolve most of the socialist
      sects that have existed. What self-emancipation meant to Marx and Engels is evident particularly in their
      criticisms of other socialisms of the time, as well as in their critique of ruling ideologies. One was as likely
      as the other to praise the vision of sheep following a Good Shepherd.

      fostered, and in America’s greener pastures turned his “communism” into a petty-bourgeois radicalism that was
      discrediting to his former associates. Marx and Engels collaborated on a circular explaining to their American
      friends why Kriege was not a communist. The first part of this statement is devoted to Kriege’s “Transformation
      of Communism into Love-Mongering.” Other passages point to Kriege’s pattern of treating political disciples as
      pious sheep. The point was not simply Kriege’s religiosity, but how he put it to political use. According to

      It is characteristic of a generality like the principle of self-emancipation that it can be understood concretely

      generalizes on this basic conception in various contexts. Let us look at some typical cases in which they

      confess they are striving to replace the old aristocracy with a new one. To counter the existing oligarchy they
      would like to speak <em id="ch06--219" class="calibre8">in the name of the people</em>, but at the same time avoid having the

      The case is somewhat different when the context of the generalities is a period when deeds speak, as during
      revolutions. In the revolution of 1848-1849 Marx’s paper had no lack of occasions to make the point that victory
      depended on fully unleashing the people’s struggle from below. Political freedom entailed self-emancipation. “In

      But there is still one power which the gentlemen in Sans Souci [royal palace] give little heed, to be sure, but

      participants on the stage of history and the passive onlookers in the pit or in the balconies. He writes, on the
      first phase of the revolution:

      As soon as it is risen up, a class in which the revolutionary interests of society are concentrated finds the
      content and the material for its revolutionary activity directly in its own situation: foes to be laid low,
      measures dictated by the needs of the struggle to be taken; the consequences of its own deeds drive it on … The
      French working class had not attained this level; it was still incapable of accomplishing its own

    <h3 class="h2" id="ch06lev5">5. LITERATURE AND REVOLUTION</h3>

    <div class="indent" id="ch06--267">
      Another approach to this question is provided by the image of “the People” in literature. A writer, to be sure,
      is not making a revolution, but is creating a literary work, which is certainly different, and all the more under
      the creator’s own control. In the few cases where we see Marx or Engels making literary judgments on
      contemporaneous works, the present question figures prominently. Here are two cases in point. In response to
      Margaret Harkness’ novel <em id="ch06--268" class="calibre8">City Girl</em>, Engels’ letter to <a id="page_160" class="calibre6"></a>the author was
      very laudatory, but suggested a criticism. While he specifically refused to judge a novel by its social or
      political content—its “tendency”—he objected that Harkness’ treatment of the mass of workers was simply untrue to
      life:
    </div>

    <div class="bq" id="ch06--270">
      °°In the “City Girl” the working class figures as a passive mass, unable to help itself and not even showing
      (making) any attempt at striving to help itself. All attempts to drag it out of its torpid misery come from
      without, from above. Now if this was a correct description about 1800 or 1810, in the days of Saint-Simon and
      Robert Owen, it cannot appear so in 1887 to a man who for nearly fifty years has had the honour of sharing in
      most of the fights of the militant proletariat. The rebellious reaction of the working class against the
      oppressive medium which surrounds them, their attempts—convulsive, half conscious or conscious—at recovering
      their status as human beings, belong to history and must therefore lay claim to a place in the domain of
      realism.<sup id="ch06--271" class="calibre13"><a id="ch06fn49" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch06--273" href="39_split_000.html#ch06fn49-r">49</a></sup>
    </div>

    <div class="noindent" id="ch06--274">
      Or perhaps, he added, the author was merely concentrating on “the passive side of working-class life, reserving
      the active side for another work.” He was willing to admit that London’s East End, the scene of the novel, showed
      this passive side—workers “passively submitting to fate”—more than anywhere else. His objection had to be pitched
      in apparently general terms, based on the past, that is, on experience; but it was in the same East End, only
      three months after this letter, that the turbulent “New Unionism” flamed up in a match factory, as we saw in
      <a class="nounder1" id="ch06--275" href="11.html#ch04">Chapter 4</a>.

      Our second case is provided by Ferdinand Lassalle’s sortie into belles lettres with his poetic drama <em id="ch06--277" class="calibre8">Franz von Sickingen</em>, on the alliance of the knights under Sickingen and Hutten with Luther in
      the wars of the German Reformation. Lassalle requested a critique from both Marx and Engels, and the exchange of
      correspondence is enlightening. Whereas in <em id="ch06--278" class="calibre8">The Peasant War in Germany</em> Engels had turned
      center stage over to Thomas Miinzer and his revolt from below as well as to the peasant rebellion, Lassalle chose
      to focus on and idealize the obsolete figures of the knightly class who were defending a moribund social stratum.
      Even more significantly: throughout Lassalle’s drama, Sickingen is spoken of literally as the Savior, the
      “people’s shepherd,” and in other similar terms; the masses are openly viewed by Sickingen in the same way as his
      creator Lassalle viewed his own flock of sheep:

      Marx’s and Engels’ criticisms politely and diplomatically explained to Lassalle why the drama failed of its
      tragic effect. For our present purposes they especially emphasized the mistake (literary and historical) in
      concentrating on the upper-class rebels. Marx counseled: you concentrated all interest in the “<em id="ch06--289" class="calibre8">noble</em> representatives of the revolution—behind whose watchwords of unity and liberty there still
      lurked the dream of the old empire and of club-law,” instead of making the revolutionary elements of the city and
      countryside an important part of the background. Engels made the same point in several ways, adding that Lassalle
      had missed the real tragedy represented by these two hero-figures, Sickingen and Hutten, who had placed
      themselves in the void between the nobility and the peasantry, that is, “the tragic collision between the
      historically necessary postulate and the practically impossible execution.” Marx, furthermore, did not conceal
      the Sickingen-Lassalle identity: “Have you yourself not fallen to a certain extent into the diplomatic error,
      like your Franz von Sickingen, of placing the Lutheran-knightly opposition above the plebeian-Miinzerian
      opposition?”<sup id="ch06--290" class="calibre13"><a id="ch06fn51" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch06--292" href="39_split_000.html#ch06fn51-r">51</a></sup> Marx was less diplomatic when he later wrote to a friend characterizing

    <div class="indent" id="ch06--302">
      As in 1848, as in all revolutions, the experience of the Paris Commune brought the idea of self-emancipation out
      of the manifestos and into the stream of reality. Marx’s views on the Commune will be considered at large in a
      later volume but an anticipatory note is in order here.

    <div class="indent" id="ch06--303">
      Shortly before the Commune, in the International’s second Address on the Franco-Prussian War, Marx already
      pointed to the feature about <a id="page_162" class="calibre6"></a>the newly formed republic of liberal politicians that excited
      “misgivings.” It was the fact that this regime had been engineered from above; that Bonapartism had not been
      <em id="ch06--305" class="calibre8">subverted—</em>which literally means, overturned from below—but only replaced by the Third
      Republic:

      That Republic has not subverted the throne, but only taken its place become vacant. It has been proclaimed, not

      The great thing about the Commune, for Marx, was that the case was just the opposite: the working masses of Paris
      took over.

      °°It is a strange fact. In spite of all the tall talk and all the immense literature, for the last sixty years,
      about Emancipation of Labor, no sooner do the working men anywhere take the subject into their own hands with a
      will, than uprises at once all the apologetic phraseology of the mouthpieces of present society …<sup id="ch06--312" class="calibre13"><a id="ch06fn55" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch06--314" href="39_split_000.html#ch06fn55-r">55</a></sup>

      In Marx’s first draft for <em id="ch06--316" class="calibre8">The Civil War in France</em>, which was longer and more discursive,
      Marx asked: what is it that is <em id="ch06--317" class="calibre8">new</em> about this revolution, in terms of previous French
      revolutions? True, the workers have borne the brunt, but that was always so. Likewise, “That the revolution is
      made in <em id="ch06--318" class="calibre8">the name</em> and confessedly <em id="ch06--319" class="calibre8">for</em> the popular masses, that is,
      the producing masses, is a feature this Revolution has in common with all its predecessors.” Here is the answer:

    <div class="bq" id="ch06--320">
      °°The new feature is that the people, after the first rise [rising], have not disarmed themselves and surrendered
      their power into the hands of the Republican mountebanks of the ruling classes, that is, by the constitution of
      the <em id="ch06--321" class="calibre8">Commune</em>, they have taken the actual management of their Revolution into their own
      hands and found at the same time, in the case of success, the means to hold it in the hands of the People itself,
      displacing the State machinery, the governmental machinery of the ruling classes by a governmental machinery of
      their own. This is their ineffable crime! Workmen infringing upon the governmental privilege of the upper 10,000
      and proclaiming their will to break the economical basis of that class despotism which for its own sake wielded
      the organised State-force of society! This is it that has thrown the respectable classes in Europe as in the
      United States <a id="page_163" class="calibre6"></a>into the paroxysm of convulsions and accounts for their shrieks of

      There follows the statement: “But the actual ‘social’ character of their Republic consists only in this, that
      workmen govern the Paris Commune!”—which was expanded in the final version.

      “Some patronising friends of the working class,” writes Marx,<a id="ch06en3-r" class="calibre6"></a><a class="nounder1" id="ch06--329" href="43.html#ch06en3">*</a> ask sympathy for the Commune because it did not undertake any “socialist
      enterprises,” any utopian projects. Marx replies:

    <div class="bq" id="ch06--330">
      These benevolent patronisers, profoundly ignorant of the real aspirations and the real movement of the working
      classes, forget one thing. All the socialist founders of Sects belong to a period in which the working class
      themselves were neither sufficiently trained and organised by the march of capitalist society itself to enter as
      historical agents upon the world’s stage, nor were the material conditions of their emancipation sufficiently
      matured in the old world itself.<sup id="ch06--331" class="calibre13"><a id="ch06fn58" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch06--333" href="39_split_000.html#ch06fn58-r">58</a></sup>

      But (he goes on to say) the Commune was right in not setting up a Fourierist phalanstery or a little Icaria à la

      The principle of self-emancipation has often been praised as a democratic conception: people taking their own
      destiny in hand. This is <a id="page_164" class="calibre6"></a>true enough. What is sometimes overlooked is that this principle
      underlines the <em id="ch06--343" class="calibre8">revolutionary</em> (literally: subversive, overturning) nature of Marx’s view
      of socialism. Nothing is more revolutionary in its thrust than this principled rejection of all “gracious
      patronage from above” (to use an expression of Engels’).<sup id="ch06--344" class="calibre13"><a id="ch06fn60" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch06--346" href="39_split_000.html#ch06fn60-r">60</a></sup> All the more so because it is double-edged,

      So if Marxism, as we have explained, can be briefly defined as the theory and practice of proletarian revolution,
      it was equally the theory and practice of the self-emancipation of the working class. Only a movement looking to
      class struggle from below could be a genuinely proletarian revolutionary movement; for it was the proletariat
      that was <em id="ch06--348" class="calibre8">below—</em>“the lowest stratum of our present society,” which “cannot stir, cannot
      raise itself up, without the whole superincumbent strata of official society being sprung up into the
      air.”<sup id="ch06--349" class="calibre13"><a id="ch06fn61" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch06--351" href="39_split_000.html#ch06fn61-r">61</a></sup>

      The principle of self-emancipation is illuminated by its opposite, which, as we have seen, Marx had to discuss
      from time to time: the “revolution from above.”<sup id="ch06--353" class="calibre13"><a id="ch06fn62" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch06--355" href="39_split_000.html#ch06fn62-r">62</a></sup> Whether this was a palace-revolution or a Bonapartist

      commented on the revolution-from-above pattern in the course of the draft address on the Commune which we have
      already cited. In pre-Bismarck Prussia, the Stein-Hardenberg reforms had been carried through in order to rally
      popular support against Napoleon; in Russia the czar’s emancipation of the serfs had been engineered from the
      top. Marx wrote:
