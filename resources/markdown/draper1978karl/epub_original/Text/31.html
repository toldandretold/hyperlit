    A note to <a class="nounder4" id="notec--4" href="16.html#ch08">Chapter 8</a>, page 204</h2>

    <div class="indent" id="notec--5">
      The standard marxological practice has long been to treat the term and concept of permanent revolution as
      “Blanquist,” as has been true also of the term <em id="notec--6" class="calibre8">dictatorship of the proletariat.</em> In one
      case as in the other, the claim is nothing but a myth. No one has even tried to adduce any evidence that Blanqui
      or his followers ever used the phrase before Marx. The myth has fed only on itself, by dint of being endlessly
      repeated by eminent authorities.
    </div>

    <h3 class="h3a" id="noteclev1">1. THE “BLANQUIST” MYTH</h3>

    <div class="indent" id="notec--8">
      The leading authorities on Blanqui have never found it in his writings or in his movement. Maurice Dommanget is
      the best case in point: although he habitually seeks reasons to make a proto-Marxist out of Blanqui, he does not
      endow Blanqui with paternity for permanent revolution.<sup id="notec--9" class="calibre13"><a id="notecfn1" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="notec--11" href="39_split_001.html#notecfn1-r">1</a></sup> Spitzer makes mention only of “the idea of the ‘permanent
      revolution’ which is sometimes attributed to Blanqui.”<sup id="notec--12" class="calibre13"><a id="notecfn2" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="notec--14" href="39_split_001.html#notecfn2-r">2</a></sup> This means that neither turned up any Blanquist source for
      the term. Spitzer’s reference for the “sometimes attributed” is to Andler, who makes the standard claim with the
      standard lack of evidence, in a context which shows he does not know how Marx used the term and the
      concept.<sup id="notec--15" class="calibre13"><a id="notecfn3" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="notec--17" href="39_split_001.html#notecfn3-r">3</a></sup> Spitzer also thinks he sees the idea—not the term—in Proudhon, but the passage
      to which he refers explicitly advocates the idea of gradualism in social change <em id="notec--18" class="calibre8">without</em>
      revolution, that is, uninterrupted change by reform.<sup id="notec--19" class="calibre13"><a id="notecfn4" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="notec--21" href="39_split_001.html#notecfn4-r">4</a></sup>
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="notec--22">
      We have also shown in <a class="nounder1" id="notec--23" href="16.html#ch08">Chapter 8</a> that the idea of
      permanent revolution itself is alien to and incompatible with Blanqui’s views on revolution.<sup id="notec--24" class="calibre13"><a id="notecfn5" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="notec--26" href="39_split_001.html#notecfn5-r">5</a></sup>
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="notec--27">
      The irrelevance of Blanqui in this connection is further borne out by an ironical fact: the only contemporary
      passage that used the term <a id="page_592" class="calibre6"></a><em id="notec--29" class="calibre8">permanent revolution</em> in proximity to the
      name of Blanqui was by Marx himself. This is the passage in Marx’s <em id="notec--30" class="calibre8">Class Struggles in
      France</em>, quoted in <a class="nounder1" id="notec--31" href="18.html#ch10">Chapter 10</a> above,<sup id="notec--32" class="calibre13"><a id="notecfn6" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="notec--34" href="39_split_001.html#notecfn6-r">6</a></sup> which
      refers to “revolutionary socialism … <em id="notec--35" class="calibre8">Communism</em>, for which the bourgeoisie has itself
      invented the name of <em id="notec--36" class="calibre8">Blanqui</em>,” and which then associates this socialism or communism with
      “the declaration of the permanence of the revolution.” Marx is here saying that it is the bourgeoisie that has
      invented the system of calling revolutionary socialism by Blanqui’s name—which was true. (The system was
      reinvented a half century later by Eduard Bernstein.) As a matter of fact, at the time Marx was writing about,
      Blanqui was in jail and there was virtually no movement led by him. What follows after Marx’s mention of Blanqui
      is <em id="notec--37" class="calibre8">Marx’s</em> own formulation of the content of this revolutionary socialism or communism,
      which has thus been sufficiently distinguished from the bogeyman invented by the bourgeoisie.<sup id="notec--38" class="calibre13"><a id="notecfn7" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="notec--40" href="39_split_001.html#notecfn7-r">7</a></sup>
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="notec--41">
      As a supplement to the modern marxological effort to fob <em id="notec--42" class="calibre8">permanent revolution</em> off on
      Blanqui, there is also a sporadic effort to blur the fact that Marx made it his own. Perhaps the most influential
      source of this kind of scholarship was Boris Nicolaievsky. In a much-quoted article on another subject,
      Nicolaievsky was carried away by his enthusiasm for claiming that Marx must be divorced from the authorship of
      the “Address to the Communist League” of March 1850 (discussed in Special Note E). He incautiously asserts that
      this Address included “the slogan of ‘permanent revolution’ which he [Marx] never mentions anywhere else in his
      writings.” He then adds a footnote to inform the reader that what he has just asserted is untrue:
    </div>

    <div class="bqi" id="notec--43">
      If we leave out his early <em id="notec--44" class="calibre8">Judenfrage</em> [“On the Jewish Question”], Marx speaks of
      “permanent revolution” only in <em id="notec--45" class="calibre8">The Class Struggles in France</em>, using the term to describe
      Blanqui’s position. We know that this work was written at the same time as the “Appeal” [the March address]. On
      the other hand “permanent revolution” kept popping up again and again in the publications of the leftist
      opposition to Marx in Cologne in 1848-1849 [meaning Gottschalk].<sup id="notec--46" class="calibre13"><a id="notecfn8" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="notec--48" href="39_split_001.html#notecfn8-r">8</a></sup>
    </div>

    <div class="noindentt" id="notec--49">
      The last sentence was discussed in <a class="nounder1" id="notec--50" href="16.html#ch08">Chapter 8</a>.<sup id="notec--51" class="calibre13"><a id="notecfn9" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="notec--53" href="39_split_001.html#notecfn9-r">9</a></sup> So to
      footnote the assertion that Marx <em id="notec--54" class="calibre8">never</em> mentions permanent revolution <em id="notec--55" class="calibre8">anywhere</em> other than the Address, Nicolaievsky adds in small type the queasy admission that he
      knows of Marx’s use of the term in <em id="notec--56" class="calibre8">three</em> places. Of course, we have discussed several
      other passages, which Nicolaievsky ignores.
    </div>

    <h3 class="h3a" id="noteclev2"><a id="page_593" class="calibre15"></a>2. THE FRENCH REVOLUTIONARY CONNECTION</h3>

    <div class="indent" id="notec--59">
      If not Blanqui, who did originate the term? As far as I know, no pre-Marx use of the term has ever been
      documented—although Marx’s first uses of it do not sound as if he is coining a new expression, as we shall see.
      But there is widespread confidence that it must have originated in the writings of the French Revolution (perhaps
      newspapers or pamphlets). Thus a dissertation by F. W. Seidler on the history of the word <em id="notec--60" class="calibre8">revolution</em> states that the idea of permanent revolution stems from the French Revolution, but it
      mentions no actual use of the term.<sup id="notec--61" class="calibre13"><a id="notecfn10" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="notec--63" href="39_split_001.html#notecfn10-r">10</a></sup> Guérin’s well-researched work on the left wing of the Revolution pays
      much attention to permanent revolution as a pattern, but likewise mentions no actual use of the term; one assumes
      his research found none.<sup id="notec--64" class="calibre13"><a id="notecfn11" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="notec--66" href="39_split_001.html#notecfn11-r">11</a></sup> But the belief cannot be dismissed, since the problem of permanent
      revolution—the perspective of continuing on to a vaguely adumbrated social phase of the revolutionary process—was
      so important at the time. We must leave open the possibility that the term did appear, though no one has pointed
      to it.
    </div>

    <div class="indentb" id="notec--67">
      That the revolutionaries of the 1840s would have looked back to the French Revolution for such terms was
      characteristic of the period. Engels later wrote:
    </div>

    <div class="bqi" id="notec--68">
      When the February Revolution broke out, all of us, as far as our conceptions of the conditions and the course of
      revolutionary movements were concerned, were under the spell of previous historical experience, particularly that
      of France.… It was, therefore, natural and unavoidable that our conceptions of the nature and the course of the
      “social” revolution proclaimed in Paris in February 1848, of the revolution of the proletariat, should be
      strongly colored by memories of the prototypes of 1789 and 1830.<sup id="notec--69" class="calibre13"><a id="notecfn12" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="notec--71" href="39_split_001.html#notecfn12-r">12</a></sup>
    </div>

    <div class="noindentt" id="notec--72">
      Also Marx: “the Revolution of 1848 knew nothing better to do than to parody, now 1789, now the revolutionary
      traditions of 1793 to 1795.”<sup id="notec--73" class="calibre13"><a id="notecfn13" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="notec--75" href="39_split_001.html#notecfn13-r">13</a></sup>
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="notec--76">
      In <a class="nounder1" id="notec--77" href="16.html#ch08">Chapter 8</a>. we quoted Engels’ 1884 reference to the
      French revolutionary period, Marat, and permanent revolution.<sup id="notec--78" class="calibre13"><a id="notecfn14" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="notec--80" href="39_split_001.html#notecfn14-r">14</a></sup> His context referred directly to Alfred
      Bougeart’s biography <em id="notec--81" class="calibre8">Marat</em>, but in that book one finds no mention of permanent
      revolution, term or concept. The connection was made in Engels’ mind, not by Bougeart; for Marat’s politics
      certainly evoked the pattern of permanent revolution.
    </div>

    <h3 class="h3a" id="noteclev3"><a id="page_594" class="calibre15"></a>3. FIRST USES</h3>

    <div class="indentb" id="notec--84">
      Marx’s first uses of the term are typical in that they make clear that the context is the French Revolution. The
      first known use by Marx—or anyone else—occurs in his 1843 essay “On the Jewish Question,” written after heavy
      reading on the French Revolution.<a id="notecen1-r" class="calibre6"></a><a class="nounder1" id="notec--86" href="43.html#notecen1">*</a>
    </div>

    <div class="bqi" id="notec--87">
      At times of heightened self-confidence, political life seeks to suppress its own presumption, [namely] the civil
      society and its elements, and to set itself up as the real species-life of man without any contradictions. But it
      can do this only in <em id="notec--88" class="calibre8">violent</em> contradiction with its own conditions of existence, only by
      declaring the revolution to be <em id="notec--89" class="calibre8">permanent</em> and hence the political drama ends with the
      restoration of religion, private property and all the elements of the civil society just as inevitably as war
      ends with peace.<sup id="notec--90" class="calibre13"><a id="notecfn16" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="notec--92" href="39_split_001.html#notecfn16-r">16</a></sup>
    </div>

    <div class="noindentt" id="notec--93">
      De-Hegelianized and stripped down, this passage might read: “Sometimes a political movement gets too cocky and
      tries to abolish the social order on which its political institutions are based, in order to achieve a human and
      harmonious existence. Hence it must get into violent conflict with its own social foundations; it must try to
      drive the revolution forward without a letup,” and so on.
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="notec--94">
      This, of course, has in mind a particular case, the left Jacobin attempt to drive the revolution beyond its
      bourgeois boundaries at a time when social conditions were not yet developed enough to make this possible; hence
      the inevitable failure.
    </div>

    <div class="indentb" id="notec--95">
      The following year, in <em id="notec--96" class="calibre8">The Holy Family</em>, Marx comes back to this experience:
    </div>

    <div class="bq" id="notec--97">
      … the French Revolution gave rise to ideas which led beyond the <em id="notec--98" class="calibre8">ideas</em> of the entire old
      world order [that is, of both the Old Regime and the new bourgeois order]. The revolutionary movement which began
      in 1789 in the <em id="notec--99" class="calibre8">Cercle Sociale</em> [of Fauchet], which in its mid-course had <em id="notec--100" class="calibre8">Leclerc</em> and <em id="notec--101" class="calibre8">Roux</em> [Enrage leaders] as its main representatives, and
      which finally with <em id="notec--102" class="calibre8">Babeufs</em> conspiracy was defeated for the moment, had given rise to the
      <em id="notec--103" class="calibre8">communist</em> idea …<sup id="notec--104" class="calibre13"><a id="notecfn17" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="notec--106" href="39_split_001.html#notecfn17-r">17</a></sup>
    </div>

    <div class="noindentt" id="notec--107">
      Under Robespierre, Marx explains, the political movement “had wanted to <em id="notec--108" class="calibre8">overreach</em> itself
      and had been <em id="notec--109" class="calibre8">extravagant</em>,” but once “the feudal structure had been smashed by the hammer
      of revolution,” the Jacobin <a id="page_595" class="calibre6"></a>regime gave way to the Directorate, under which bourgeois
      society “began to develop <em id="notec--111" class="calibre8">prosaically</em>” and powerfully. However, with Napoleon’s coup
      d’état the state once again set out to subordinate civil life to autonomous political power (as we have discussed
      elsewhere<sup id="notec--112" class="calibre13"><a id="notecfn18" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="notec--114" href="39_split_001.html#notecfn18-r">18</a></sup>), by means of another form of “terror” (that is, force), but for Napoleon the
      motive was not revolution but war (national aggrandizement). It is in this context that Marx writes: Napoleon
      “<em id="notec--115" class="calibre8">executed the Terror by substituting permanent war for permanent revolution.</em>”<sup id="notec--116" class="calibre13"><a id="notecfn19" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="notec--118" href="39_split_001.html#notecfn19-r">19</a></sup>
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="notec--119">
      In this passage <em id="notec--120" class="calibre8">permanent revolution</em> describes the whole of the French Revolution, not a
      special theory or pattern. The balancing of the two <em id="notec--121" class="calibre8">permanent</em>s is a grace note. A year
      later Engels said much the same thing without using the special term: “Napoleon applied the <em id="notec--122" class="calibre8">reign of terror</em>, which had done its work in France, <em id="notec--123" class="calibre8">to other countries, in
      the shape of war</em>,”<sup id="notec--124" class="calibre13"><a id="notecfn20" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="notec--126" href="39_split_001.html#notecfn20-r">20</a></sup> and so on.
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="notec--127">
      In both of Marx’s first uses of the term, there is as yet no necessary implication that any special concept about
      revolution is involved in the term. The full significance of the French Revolutionary pattern was understood only
      when it was taught by the events of the revolution in 1848-1849.
