<h1 id="ch12"><a class="calibre4" id="page_317"></a>12 THE PEASANT QUESTION: SOCIAL SETTING</h1>
<div class="indent" id="ch12--2">
      Much of the preceding chapter necessarily applies also to the agrarian sector of the petty-bourgeoisie, that is,
      to intermediate social strata on the land, which means primarily the peasantry.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch12--3">
      The peasantry stands apart from other intermediate classes in two important respects: (1) its size—its
      preponderance in numbers and in area covered, not only in the world at large but also in Europe, including most
      of the countries of Western Europe in Marx’s time; (2) the particularity of its conditions of life, which are
      rural rather than urban, and tend to be socially more homogeneous than any class in urban society. Outside of the
      two polar classes, it is the peasantry that has historically been most important to the fate of socialist
      revolution on a world scale.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch12--4">
      One of the hoariest of the myths of marxology is the belief that Marx and Engels simply dismissed the peasantry
      as rural troglodytes without interest—the “Marx against the peasants” legend.<a class="calibre6" id="ch12en1-r"></a><a class="nounder1" href="43.html#ch12en1" id="ch12--6">*</a> In fact, they wrote more voluminously on the peasant question
      than on many important aspects of the working-class movement.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch12--7">
      Marx’s views on the politics of the peasant question are naturally based on his economic analysis of the impact
      of capitalist development on agriculture. In this work, where the economics of the agrarian question as such is
      outside our purview, we can only explain some of <a class="calibre6" id="page_318"></a>his conclusions, especially where these
      importantly condition the political issues.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch12--9"><a class="calibre14" id="ch12fn2"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch12fn2-r" id="ch12--11">2</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="indent" id="ch12--12">
      It is by no means true that Marx’s or Engels’ political views, in this or any other field, were merely deductions
      from economic premises. Marx’s agrarian economics provides limits and signposts for an investigation of the
      political problems. The political conclusions are affected also by a complex of other social conditions, which in
      turn are based on economic drives outside the field of agriculture altogether. Furthermore, Marx and Engels came
      to some political conclusions on the basis of history and experience before working out the economic theory,
      which in turn acted to test, modify, condition and suggest new developments in the political arena.

<h2 id="ch12lev1">1. TWO FORMS OF AN EVIL</h2>
<div class="indent" id="ch12--14">
      A basic economic consideration is the relative unproductiveness of small holdings in agriculture, analogous to
      the problem of small units in industry. The existence of a landowning peasantry fosters a tendency counter to the
      fullest utilization of the modern forces of production in technology and organization.
    </div>
<div class="bq" id="ch12--15">
      This mode of production presupposes parcelling [division into small parcels] of the soil, and scattering of the
      other means of production. As it excludes the concentration of these means of production, so also it excludes
      cooperation, division of labor within each separate process of production, the control over and the productive
      application of the forces of Nature by society, and the free development of the social productive powers. It is
      compatible only with a system of production and a society moving within narrow and more or less primitive bounds.
      To perpetuate it would be, as Pecqueur rightly says, “to decree universal mediocrity.” At a certain stage of
      development it brings forth the material agencies for its own dissolution.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch12--16"><a class="calibre14" id="ch12fn3"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch12fn3-r" id="ch12--18">3</a></sup>

<div class="indentt" id="ch12--19">
      This passage occurs in a chapter of <em class="calibre8" id="ch12--20">Capital</em> on the “Historical Tendency of Capitalist
      Accumulation” which presents a highly telescoped summary of the effects of capitalism, and it refers to the
      artisans and urban petty-bourgeoisie as much as to the peasantry. It is primarily a description not of the future
      but of the past, the capitalist <a class="calibre6" id="page_319"></a>destruction of “the old social organization” of late
      feudalism.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch12--22">
      In his <em class="calibre8" id="ch12--23">Class Struggles in France</em> Marx summarized the reasons why the French peasantry
      groaned under the burden of mortgage debt:
    </div>
<div class="bq" id="ch12--24">
      Now the fruitfulness of land diminishes in the same measure as land is divided. The application of machinery to
      the land, the division of labor, major soil improvement measures, such as cutting drainage and irrigation canals
      and the like, become more and more impossible, while the <em class="calibre8" id="ch12--25">unproductive costs</em> of cultivation
      increase in the same proportion as the division of the instrument of production itself. All this, regardless of
      whether the possessor of the small allotment possesses capital or not. But the more the division increases, the
      more does the parcel of land with its utterly wretched inventory form the entire capital of the small allotment
      peasant, the more does investment of capital in the land diminish, the more does the cotter lack land, money and
      education for making use of the progress in agronomy, and the more does the cultivation of the soil
      retrogress.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch12--26"><a class="calibre14" id="ch12fn4"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch12fn4-r" id="ch12--28">4</a></sup>

<div class="noindentt" id="ch12--29">
      This refers concretely to a specific scale of land ownership, the division of the land among the peasantry after
      the French Revolution, and its subsequent tendency to parcellization. This conditions the thesis that large-scale
      production is economically superior to such small-scale production.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch12--30">
      It is clearly a non sequitur to push this thesis into the ground with two other alleged deductions: (1) that
      therefore any large-scale enterprise is automatically superior to any small-scale enterprise; and (2) that the
      larger the scale the greater the efficiency in a smooth curve up to infinity.<a class="calibre6" id="ch12en2-r"></a><a class="nounder1" href="43.html#ch12en2" id="ch12--32">*</a> The issue was the economic consequences of the peasant mode
      of production as a historical reality.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch12--33">
      As for the first deduction: Marx’s critique of the economic consequences of peasant (small-holding) agriculture
      is only half the picture. <em class="calibre8" id="ch12--34">Marx did not counterpose large-scale agriculture to small-scale as
      his</em> <a class="calibre6" id="page_320"></a><em class="calibre8" id="ch12--36">economic good.</em> The consequences of the former were
      deleterious also, as long as private property in land was maintained.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch12--37">
      Since this half of the question is seldom brought out, here is a relevant passage from <em class="calibre8" id="ch12--38">Capital</em>, which provides the real context for the critique of both:
    </div>
<div class="bq1" id="ch12--39">
      Here, in small-scale agriculture, the price of land, a form and result of private ownership, appears as a barrier
      to production itself. In large-scale agriculture and large estates operating on a capitalist basis, ownership
      likewise acts as a barrier, because it limits the tenant farmer in his productive investment of capital, which in
      the final analysis benefits not him but the landlord. In both forms, exploitation and squandering of the vitality
      of the soil (apart from making exploitation dependent upon the accidental and unequal circumstances of individual
      producers rather than the attained level of social development) takes the place of conscious rational cultivation
      of the soil as eternal communal property, an inalienable condition for the existence and reproduction of a chain
      of successive generations of the human race. In the case of small property, this results from the lack of means
      and knowledge of applying the social labor productivity. In the case of large property, it results from the
      exploitation of such means for the most rapid enrichment of farmer and proprietor. In the case of both, through
      dependence on the market-price.
    </div>
<div class="bqi2" id="ch12--40">
      All critique of small landed property resolves itself in the final analysis into a criticism of private ownership
      as a barrier and hindrance to agriculture. And similarly all counter-criticism of large landed property. In
      either case, of course, we leave aside all secondary political considerations. This barrier and hindrance, which
      are erected by all private landed property vis-á-vis agricultural production and the rational cultivation,
      maintenance and improvement of the soil itself, develop on both sides merely in different forms, and in wrangling
      over the specific forms of this evil its ultimate cause is forgotten.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch12--41"><a class="calibre14" id="ch12fn6"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch12fn6-r" id="ch12--43">6</a></sup>

<div class="noindentt" id="ch12--44">
      The two “specific forms of this evil” are small-scale agriculture and large-scale agriculture <em class="calibre8" id="ch12--45">on the basis of private property in land.</em> This is equally forgotten in “wrangling over” Marx’s
      views on the peasant question.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch12--46">
      In <em class="calibre8" id="ch12--47">Capital</em> Marx continues with the explanation that, if small landed property presupposes
      a backward state of economic development, large landed property vitiates the quality both of the land itself and
      of social <a class="calibre6" id="page_321"></a>conditions on and off the land, in the towns as well as on the
      countryside.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch12--49"><a class="calibre14" id="ch12fn7"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch12fn7-r" id="ch12--51">7</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="bq1" id="ch12--52">
      While small landed property creates a class of barbarians standing halfway outside of society, a class combining
      all the crudeness of primitive forms of society with the anguish and misery of civilized countries, large landed
      property undermines labor-power … on the land itself. Large-scale industry and large-scale mechanized agriculture
      work together. If originally distinguished by the fact that the former lays waste and destroys principally
      labor-power, hence the natural force of human beings, whereas the latter more directly exhausts the natural
      vitality of the soil, they join hands in the further course of development in that the industrial system in the
      countryside also enervates the laborers, and industry and commerce on their part supply agriculture with the
      means for exhausting the soil.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch12--53"><a class="calibre14" id="ch12fn8"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch12fn8-r" id="ch12--55">8</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="indentt" id="ch12--56">
      Marx’s central interest, then, is not in championing large-scale production against small-scale, but in
      counterposing socialized production to the evils of both “specific forms” of private ownership of land. Indeed,
      this was already true in his very first essay in economic analysis.<a class="calibre6" id="ch12en3-r"></a><a class="nounder1" href="43.html#ch12en3" id="ch12--58">*</a> This does not gainsay the fact that socialized agriculture for the most
      part presupposes a scale of production beyond the peasant family farm.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch12--59">
      In <em class="calibre8" id="ch12--60">Capital</em> there is a passage in which Marx even seems to be complimenting peasant
      economy, after a discussion of the impact of capitalism on agriculture:
    </div>
<div class="bq1" id="ch12--61">
      The moral of history, also to be deduced from other observations concerning agriculture, is that the capitalist
      system works against a rational agriculture, or that a rational agriculture is <a class="calibre6" id="page_322"></a>incompatible
      with the capitalist system (although the latter promotes technical improvements in agriculture), and needs either
      the hand of the small peasant living by his own labor or the control of associated producers.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch12--63"><a class="calibre14" id="ch12fn11"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch12fn11-r" id="ch12--65">11</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="noindentt" id="ch12--66">
      To be sure, Marx’s own choice is the second of the two alternatives–that is, socialized (including cooperative)
      agriculture “under the control of associated producers”—but here peasant ownership seems to be counterposed to
      large-scale <em class="calibre8" id="ch12--67">capitalist</em> ownership to the advantage of the former.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch12--68">
      But it would be as disingenuous to invent a “Marx for the peasant” as it has been to fabricate a “Marx against
      the peasant.” The issue is quite different: Is the actual trend of economic development under capitalism against
      the peasant or not?
    </div>
<h2 id="ch12lev2">2. THE HISTORICAL VIEW</h2>
<div class="indent" id="ch12--70">
<em class="calibre8" id="ch12--71">The actual trend of economic development:</em> this moot question concerns us here only in
      order to lay a basis for understanding Marx’s political and programmatic views. Especially in moving from
      economic theory to politics, the meaning of <em class="calibre8" id="ch12--72">trend</em> has at least three aspects: the <em class="calibre8" id="ch12--73">direction</em> of change—trend proper; the <em class="calibre8" id="ch12--74">tempo</em> of change, including the
      problem of zigzags, interruptions, and so on; and the <em class="calibre8" id="ch12--75">forms</em> in which the change manifests
      itself.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch12--76">
      The common fate of economic prognoses is that foreseen tendencies work out in a more complex way than expected.
      The question of tempo, too, has a long history in all fields, mostly because of the telescopic-lens effect. If
      you look down your nose at your feet, the range of view is rather limited but you may be able to make a very
      accurate estimate of distance in centimeters. If you look through a telescopic lens at unfamiliar terrain, you
      will be able to see far off and descry the winds of change, but everything is brought close up.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch12--77">
      Marx’s analysis of capitalism pointed to the tendency toward concentration and centralization, and hence the
      decline of the little man, not only in industry but also in agriculture.<a class="calibre6" id="ch12en4-r"></a><a class="nounder1" href="43.html#ch12en4" id="ch12--79">*</a> In both fields, this <a class="calibre6" id="page_323"></a>tendency has worked itself
      out in various forms in different countries. The differences in form are bound to affect political policy to an
      important degree. A historical perspective on the tendency is necessary.

<div class="indent" id="ch12--81">
      For Marx, small-holding agriculture once played a progressive role:
    </div>
<div class="bq1" id="ch12--82">
      This form of free self-managing peasant proprietorship of land parcels as the prevailing normal form constitutes,
      on the one hand, the economic foundation of society during the best periods of classical antiquity, and on the
      other hand, it is found among modern nations as one of the forms arising from the dissolution of feudal
      landownership …
    </div>
<div class="bqi2" id="ch12--83">
      The free ownership of the self-managing peasant is evidently the most normal form of landed property for
      small-scale operation … Ownership of the land is as necessary for full development of this mode of production as
      ownership of tools is for free development of handicraft production. Here is the basis for the development of
      personal independence. It is a necessary transitional stage for the development of agriculture itself.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch12--84"><a class="calibre14" id="ch12fn14"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch12fn14-r" id="ch12--86">14</a></sup>

      The human values of rural life were once real ones; there are still shards and remnants about—idealized by (say)

      development of the free individuality no longer leads through Brattleboro any more than the sturdy virtues of the
      pioneers can be recaptured at the Frontier Hotel in Las Vegas. This is Marx’s meaning in going right on from “It

      forces undermining the peasant economy. It begins as follows:

<div class="bq" id="ch12--101">
      The causes which bring about its downfall show its limitations. These are: Destruction of rural domestic
      industry, which forms its normal supplement as a result of the development of large-scale industry; a gradual
      impoverishment and exhaustion of the soil subjected to this cultivation; usurpation by big landowners of the
      common lands, which constitute the second supplement of the management of land parcels everywhere and which alone
      enable it to raise cattle; competition, either of the plantation system or large-scale capitalist agriculture.
      Improvements in agriculture, which on the one hand cause a fall in agricultural prices and, on the other, require
      greater outlays and more extensive material conditions of production, also contribute toward this, as in England
      during the first half of the eighteenth century.

      Proprietorship of land parcels by its very nature excludes the development of social productive forces of labor,

      Usury and a taxation system must impoverish it everywhere. The expenditure of capital in the price of the land

<div class="indent" id="ch12--115">
      The simplest form of the decline of the peasant economy is to be seen in terms of the concentration and
      centralization of landownership. Although this is sometimes taken to be synonymous with the decline thesis, we
      shall see that it is not even decisive for Marx’s view of the matter.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch12--116">
      In this form, the tendency of decline has been spotty, as a result of counteractive forces in different national

      capitalist countries, England and the United States, the result has been unmistakable. England, of course, was
      already in Marx’s time the very model of a capitalist society based on uprooting the peasantry from the land. In
      the U.S., concentration of ownership worked itself out in a more zigzag course, but the evidence today is massive
      and indisputable.<a class="calibre6" id="ch12en7-r"></a><a class="nounder1" href="43.html#ch12en7" id="ch12--121">*</a> <a class="calibre6" id="page_326"></a>For many other parts of the world the facts are still controverted.

<div class="indent" id="ch12--123">
      But the simple concentration and centralization of ownership is, for Marx, not the only and not necessarily the
      main criterion to determine the meaning of agrarian development.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch12--124">
      Let us begin with a point Engels had to make against a book by Anton Menger. Menger had argued that in the Roman
      Empire the economic preconditions of socialism were even more highly developed than under capitalism, since in
      those days “half the province of Africa was held as the property of six people,” and so on. This was surely a
      formidable case of centralization! But, Engels pointed out, the relation between concentration-centralization and
      socialism was not that kind of mechanical thing. Part of his reply went as follows, under the title “Lawyers’
      Socialism”:
    </div>
<div class="bq1" id="ch12--125">
      Now, this [modern industrial production] gets compared with the conditions of imperial Rome, where it was not a
      question of large-scale machine production either in industry or in the agricultural economy. To be sure, we find
      a concentration in land <em class="calibre8" id="ch12--126">ownership</em>, but one must be a lawyer to consider this as
      equivalent to the development of socially organized labor in big enterprises. If we put before Herr Menger three
      examples of landownership: an Irish landlord who owns 50,000 acres, which are worked by 5000 tenants in small
      lots averaging ten acres each; a Scottish landlord who has turned 50,000 acres into hunting grounds; and an
      American giant farm of 10,000 acres in which wheat is cultivated as in a large-scale industry—he will say that in
      the first two cases the concentration of the means of production has gone five times as far as the last
      case.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch12--127"><a class="calibre14" id="ch12fn25"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch12fn25-r" id="ch12--129">25</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="noindentt" id="ch12--130">
      Menger’s approach was unenlightening because it took the <em class="calibre8" id="ch12--131">form</em> (concentration) as
      decisive, disregarding the social relations of production <a class="calibre6" id="page_327"></a>underlying the form. Concentration
      on the Roman African scale would become significant if occurring on the basis of modern society. And in fact,
      twenty-two years before, Marx had remarked in the Inaugural Address of the International that, as English
      landownership had concentrated 11 percent in ten years, “the land question will become singularly simplified, as
      it had become in the Roman empire, when Nero grinned at the discovery that half the Province of Africa was owned

      This sort of confusion between superficial forms and underlying social realities goes to the heart of the present
      problem. One aspect was heavily emphasized by Marx: the question of the peasant’s landownership as “nominal
      ownership.”
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch12--137">
      The impact of capitalist development on small-scale production, in agriculture as in industry, is reflected only
      partly by ownership statistics. In industry, the vassal relation of car dealers to Detroit or the satellite
      status of parts suppliers to prime contractors is well known; but the pattern holds also for agriculture. A
      peasant, holding juridical ownership over a parcel of land, who is completely at the mercy of the banker,
      moneylender, or mortgagee—how independent is such a peasant?
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch12--138">
      This way of looking behind the form of juridical ownership was not invented by Marx as an amendment to <em class="calibre8" id="ch12--139">Capital;</em> it was familiar to him when he had barely started his economic studies. Thus, in

      How deeply [Stirner] has penetrated into the concentration of landed property can already be deduced from the
      fact that he sees in it only the most obvious act of concentration, the mere “buying-up.” Incidentally, from what
      [Stirner] says it is not possible to perceive to what extent small landowners cease to be owners by becoming
      day-laborers [in addition].<sup class="calibre13" id="ch12--142"><a class="calibre14" id="ch12fn27"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch12fn27-r" id="ch12--144">27</a></sup>

      To this day, it is typical of Marx’s critics that they see “only the most obvious act of concentration.” Writing
      the above in 1845, Marx points only to the fact that small peasants are so often forced to hire out their
      labor-power on the side because they cannot make ends meet as independent cultivators; insofar as they begin to
      rely on their income as day-laborers to tide them over, the peasant economy becomes an appendage of the larger
      economy that is engulfing it.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch12--146">
      There are other minor respects in which the subordination of the peasant economy is symbolized. Later Marx was to
      comment that “the <a class="calibre6" id="page_328"></a>bookkeeping tenant-farmer was not produced until the rise of a capitalist
      agriculture” whereas the old peasants kept their accounts in their heads<sup class="calibre13" id="ch12--148"><a class="calibre14" id="ch12fn28"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch12fn28-r" id="ch12--150">28</a></sup>—a symbol of the
      subordination of the former to the encircling economy.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch12--151">
      In the course of the 1848 revolution, Marx begins to emphasize the most widespread form in which peasant
      landownership is hollowed out, made tenuous and ghostly, by the capitalist system that englobes it. This is
      through the channel of mortgages and the consequent “interest slavery,” the debt burden in general, and the
      resulting clutch of usury, supplemented by the bloodletting peculiar to the state known as taxation, with the
      addition of court costs and legal costs of various kinds.
    </div>
<div class="bq1" id="ch12--152">
      Especially in France, as in countries generally where parcellization dominates, the rule of the feudal lords has
      turned into the rule of the capitalists, the feudal burdens of the peasants into bourgeois mortgage

      In the spring of 1849 Marx thought the French peasantry might be radicalized by the tax burdens imposed by the
      bourgeois provisional government. The tax, he wrote, has shown “the difference between formal and real property
      ownership”:
    </div>
<div class="bq" id="ch12--157">
      it became clear … that the formal owner of the soil had become a vassal of the capitalists and that the tax hit
      only the debt-encumbered vassal. Now when in addition the real landowner [i.e., the capitalist] more than ever
      let the poor peasant feel his authority by withdrawing credit, by debt-seizures, etc., the revolution [actually
      the provisional government] became more and more odious to the peasant.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch12--158"><a class="calibre14" id="ch12fn29"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch12fn29-r" id="ch12--160">29</a></sup>

      Marx detailed the conception in his <em class="calibre8" id="ch12--162">Class Struggles in France</em> in reviewing the
      revolution: in one way or another “the French peasant cedes to the capitalist” the greater part of the income
      produced by his labor, and “therefore he has sunk to the level of the <em class="calibre8" id="ch12--163">Irish tenant
      farmer—</em>all under the pretense of being a <em class="calibre8" id="ch12--164">private proprietor</em>.” For the most part, the

      class of independent small freeholders “was a class of freeholders by name only” because the burden of mortgages
      <a class="calibre6" id="page_329"></a>and other debts was so heavy “that not the peasant, but the usurer who had advanced the
      money, was the real landowner.”<sup class="calibre13" id="ch12--169"><a class="calibre14" id="ch12fn31"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch12fn31-r" id="ch12--171">31</a></sup>

      higher ownership of landed property is transferred to the stock exchange” as the bank system expands,
      incorporates, and more and more takes over control of land from debtors’ hands; if “the agricultural revolution
      of prairie cultivation” continues, then “the time can be foreseen when [not only Germany’s but] England’s and

<div class="indent" id="ch12--207">
      In referring to the palmy days of the peasant economy in <em class="calibre8" id="ch12--208">Capital</em>, Marx calls it a mode of
      production more than once. It used to be “the economic foundation of society,” whereas “among modern nations”
      (that is, under capitalist conditions) it is left “as one of the forms arising from the dissolution of feudal
      landownership,” as a form of property in the interstices of a social system to which it is alien.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch12--209"><a class="calibre14" id="ch12fn39"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch12fn39-r" id="ch12--211">39</a></sup> The
      decline of the peasant economy has more than a quantitative side. Its qualitative side asks: What is the social
      meaning of the peasantry and the peasant economy with relation to the rest of the economy?
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch12--212">
      This is the most basic consideration. It was expressed by Marx in a passage immediately preceding one quoted
      above about the nominal proprietorship of the peasant:
    </div>
<div class="bq" id="ch12--213">
      °°this peasant proprietorship has long since outgrown its normal phase, that is, the phase in which it was a
      reality, a mode of production and a form of property which responded to the economical wants of society and
      placed the rural producers themselves into normal conditions of life. It has entered its period of decay. On the
      one side a large <em class="calibre8" id="ch12--214">proletariat fonder</em> (rural proletariat) has grown out of it whose
      interests are identical with those of the townish wages labourers. The mode of production itself has become
      superannuated by the modern progress of agronomy.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch12--215"><a class="calibre14" id="ch12fn40"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch12fn40-r" id="ch12--217">40</a></sup>

<div class="indentt" id="ch12--218">
      What is decaying, in fact, is not only peasant ownership as a form of property but <em class="calibre8" id="ch12--219">all
      nonbourgeois relationships on the land.</em> To be sure, noncapitalist forms of big landownership went first, for
      obvious reasons; the peasant parcel is the most stubborn survivor—“the last conquest” of capital, as Marx put
      it.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch12--220"><a class="calibre14" id="ch12fn41"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch12fn41-r" id="ch12--222">41</a></sup>

<div class="indent" id="ch12--223">
      Here too there was considerable continuity in Marx’s thinking. Marx had taken this approach in his very first
      study on economics, in the 1844 manuscripts. Here Marx had already written two or three pages of argumentation
      explaining the “special circumstances which lead inevitably to the accumulation of large landed property and to
      the absorption of small property by it.” He envisaged the complete absorption of the agricultural sphere by
      capitalist relations, in a simplistic way: the <a class="calibre6" id="page_331"></a>bourgeoisification of the landowner into a
      capitalist “so that there remain altogether only two classes of the population—the working class and the class of
      capitalists.” This will constitute “the final overthrow of the old [aristocracy] and the final establishment of
      the money aristocracy.”<sup class="calibre13" id="ch12--225"><a class="calibre14" id="ch12fn42"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch12fn42-r" id="ch12--227">42</a></sup> Here the thrust of the argument does not specially concern the decline of the
      smallholding peasants but rather the withering-away of <em class="calibre8" id="ch12--228">any</em> nonbourgeois class and social
      relationship on the land.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch12--229">
      This approach, therefore, does not simply compare the peasantry today to the peasantry yesterday, quantitatively
      or otherwise, but rather stresses the relation of the peasantry <em class="calibre8" id="ch12--230">to the other classes of modern
      society</em>, then and now.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch12--231">
      This is the approach Marx took in <em class="calibre8" id="ch12--232">The Eighteenth Brumaire</em> to explain how French society
      had changed between the first Napoleon and his nephew. “The economic development of smallholding property has
      radically changed the relation of the peasants to the other classes of society,” he begins. At the turn of the
      century the peasantry, consolidated on the land of the ousted nobility, was a barrier “against the landed
      aristocracy which had just been overthrown,” its boundary markers “formed the natural fortifications of the
      bourgeoisie” against feudal counterrevolution.
    </div>
<div class="bq" id="ch12--233">
      But in the course of the nineteenth century the feudal lords were replaced by urban usurers; the feudal
      obligation that went with the land was replaced by the mortgage; aristocratic landed property was replaced by
      bourgeois capital. The small holding of the peasant is now only the pretext that allows the capitalist to draw
      profits, interest and rent from the soil, while leaving it to the tiller of the soil himself to see how he can
      extract his wages.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch12--234"><a class="calibre14" id="ch12fn43"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch12fn43-r" id="ch12--236">43</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="indentt" id="ch12--237">
      Behind the form of peasant property lies the reality of “enslavement by capital,” Marx adds. This is not simply
      an agitational flourish. If (as Marx explains in the third volume of <em class="calibre8" id="ch12--238">Capital</em>) the
      independent peasant can be regarded as a one-person combination of a landlord who has himself (and family) as his
      tenant, a capitalist who employs himself as a laborer, and a worker who draws a wage from himself as
      employer,<sup class="calibre13" id="ch12--239"><a class="calibre14" id="ch12fn44"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch12fn44-r" id="ch12--241">44</a></sup> then the “profits, interest and rent” which he should be getting as
      landlord-capitalist are being siphoned off (through mortgagee, usurer, bank, state tax bureau, etc.) into the
      coffers of the dominant capitalist class, leaving him only the equivalent of his wage—and not always that much.
      Marx commented, of the sharecropper (metayer): “this poor fellow who merely combines in his own person the
      misfortune of the <a class="calibre6" id="page_332"></a>wage-worker with the misery of the small capitalist, might in fact
      consider himself lucky if he were put on fixed wages.”<sup class="calibre13" id="ch12--243"><a class="calibre14" id="ch12fn45"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch12fn45-r" id="ch12--245">45</a></sup> In terms of economic reality, he is working for his
      wage-equivalent, despite his self-image as a mini-landowner or farmer.<a class="calibre6" id="ch12en8-r"></a><a class="nounder1" href="43.html#ch12en8" id="ch12--247">*</a>
</div>
<div class="indent" id="ch12--248">
      Thus we have seen two different ways in which modern capitalism “annihilates the peasant” and “replaces him by
      the wage-laborer.”<sup class="calibre13" id="ch12--249"><a class="calibre14" id="ch12fn47"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch12fn47-r" id="ch12--251">47</a></sup> One is the obvious act of separating the peasants from their land altogether
      and forcing them to earn a living as laborers in agriculture or industry. The other is the above-described
      “enslavement by capital” while they still remain nominal proprietors of their land but are actually working for
      the equivalent of a wage. The independent peasant of the good old days and the pseudo-independent peasant inside
      the toils of a capitalist economy both hold the same <em class="calibre8" id="ch12--252">formal</em> relationship to their land,
      but behind the form is a different social (interclass) relation, a different mode of exploitation, a different
      economic reality.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch12--253">
      To be sure, these two different ways in which the peasant is reduced to the equivalent of a wage-worker are not
      at all equivalent in social consequences, the biggest difference being their effect on political consciousness.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch12--254">
      There is still another respect in which the meaning of the peasant’s small holding has changed with the
      development of capitalism: in the amount of social independence possible for the peasant. In large part,
      independence concretely used to mean self-sufficiency.
    </div>
<div class="bq" id="ch12--255">
      … the peasant of today has lost half of his former productive activity. Formerly he and his family produced, from
      raw material he had made himself, the greater part of the industrial products that he needed; the rest of what he
      required was supplied by village neighbors who plied a trade in addition to farming and were paid mostly in
      articles of exchange or in reciprocal services. The family, and still more the village, was self-sufficient,
      produced almost everything it needed…. Capitalist production put an end to this by its money economy and
      large-scale industry.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch12--256"><a class="calibre14" id="ch12fn48"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch12fn48-r" id="ch12--258">48</a></sup>

<div class="noindentt" id="ch12--259">
      The “free peasant” becomes less free than ever even if ownership of the land remains untouched. Engels sums up:
    </div>
<div class="bq" id="ch12--260">
      Possession of the means of production by the individual producers <a class="calibre6" id="page_333"></a>nowadays no longer grants

      peasant is neither in the safe possession of his tiny patch of land nor is he free. He as well as his house, his
      farmstead and his few fields belong to the usurer; his livelihood is more uncertain than that of the proletarian,
      who at least does have tranquil days now and then, which is never the case with the eternally tortured debt
      slave.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch12--262"><a class="calibre14" id="ch12fn49"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch12fn49-r" id="ch12--264">49</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="indentt" id="ch12--265">
      For all these reasons, the decline of the peasant economy must also be understood in terms of <em class="calibre8" id="ch12--266">social weight:</em> the decrease in the relative economic and social weight of the peasantry and its
      activities. If the peasant population becomes a smaller percentage of the total population as the latter figure
      rises with the development of industry; if the produce of the peasant sector of the economy becomes an ever
      smaller percentage either of agricultural production as a whole or (more important) of total national production,
      and therefore a less important factor in the economic life of the nation, then it follows that the socioeconomic
      weight of the peasantry has declined as capitalist economy has expanded. The same result obtains from the growing
      gap between the level of wealth and culture among the owning class in the city and the owning class on the land.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch12--267">
      As mentioned, it should go without saying that the decline of the peasantry does not automatically produce
      <em class="calibre8" id="ch12--268">pari passu</em> a progressive change in the peasant’s political consciousness. When, regarding
      the transformation from peasant to wage-laborer, Marx wrote that “Thus the desire for social changes and the
      class antagonisms are brought to the same level in the country as in the towns,”<sup class="calibre13" id="ch12--269"><a class="calibre14" id="ch12fn50"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch12fn50-r" id="ch12--271">50</a></sup> he was taking the long
      historical view with the telescopic lens. He was identifying the transmission gears between the economics and the
      politics of the peasant question, though the transmission is rarely smooth.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch12--272">
      The social conditions of existence on the land make for greater lags in consciousness than do urban conditions.
      This can be confirmed by comparing the radicalization of landless peasants who come to the city and become
      factory workers, as against those who remain on the land as day-laborers, rural proletarians in a peasant milieu.
      For example: on the land the day-laborer may be able to retain a morsel of land on the side, and even perhaps
      illusions about a future as a micro-landowner. This, plus community pressures and conditioning, may keep the
      day-laborer identifying with peasant concerns and sharing the peasant mentality long after personal reality has
      changed. On the other hand, in <a class="calibre6" id="page_334"></a>the city there are the obvious factors of greater
      concentration of proletarian numbers and the accompanying cultural impact of this fact.

      All discussions of the peasantry speak of small peasants and big peasants, but for Marx the distinction is not at
      bottom a merely quantitative one, like the difference between small fleas and big fleas. For him, keeping this
      distinction in mind is fundamental to a revolutionary political solution of the peasant question. “Moreover
      people forget, besides the main point—big landed property—that there are various kinds of peasants,” Engels
      remarked in a letter, apropros of the to-do in the International over the issue of land nationalization.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch12--277"><a class="calibre14" id="ch12fn51"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch12fn51-r" id="ch12--279">51</a></sup> It
      eventually became clearer that people “forget” this, in the socialist movement, especially in order to adapt to
      the bigger peasants—and their votes.

      What is a small peasant?
    </div>
<div class="bq1" id="ch12--281">
      By small peasant we mean here the owner or tenant—particularly the former—of a patch of land no bigger, as a
      rule, than he and his family can till, and no smaller than can sustain the family. This small peasant, just like
      the small handicraftsman, is therefore a toiler who differs from the modern proletarian in that he still
      possesses his instruments of labor; hence a survival of a past mode of production.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch12--282"><a class="calibre14" id="ch12fn52"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch12fn52-r" id="ch12--284">52</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="noindentt" id="ch12--285">
      To give this definition its negative form, the small peasant is one who does not employ hired labor, on a regular
      basis, and thus is not primarily an employer.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch12--286">
      In contrast, a big peasant “cannot manage without wage-workers.”<sup class="calibre13" id="ch12--287"><a class="calibre14" id="ch12fn53"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch12fn53-r" id="ch12--289">53</a></sup> Marx writes that “the
      more prosperous peasants” have the possibility of
    </div>
<div class="bq" id="ch12--290">
      exploiting agricultural wage-laborers for their own account, much as in feudal times, when the more well-to-do
      peasant serfs themselves <a class="calibre6" id="page_335"></a>also held serfs. In this way, they gradually acquire the
      possibility of accumulating a certain amount of wealth and themselves becoming transformed into future
      capitalists.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch12--292"><a class="calibre14" id="ch12fn54"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch12fn54-r" id="ch12--294">54</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="noindentt" id="ch12--295">
      This is similar to the possibility of the urban petty-bourgeois to grow into a small capitalist, as we saw in the
      preceding chapter.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch12--296"><a class="calibre14" id="ch12fn55"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch12fn55-r" id="ch12--298">55</a></sup>

      As always, there is a spectrum between the small and the big peasant; for the small peasant of the family
      farmstead may have to hire a day-laborer now and then, and a small peasant with (say) a team of horses is
      obviously bigger than the poor wight who not only lacks livestock but has to hire out part of the time; and so
      on. <em class="calibre8" id="ch12--300">Middle peasant</em> is a term of convenience for the in-between spectrum. Not only is this
      stratum defined by the others, but its politics is heavily conditioned by its milieu, as Engels observes:
    </div>
<div class="bq" id="ch12--301">
      Where the middle peasant lives among small-holding peasants his interests and views will not differ greatly from
      theirs; he knows from his own experience how many of his kind have already sunk to the level of small peasants.
      But where middle and big peasants predominate and the operation of the farm requires, generally, the help of male
      and female servants it is quite a different matter.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch12--302"><a class="calibre14" id="ch12fn56"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch12fn56-r" id="ch12--304">56</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="indentt" id="ch12--305">
      In his account of 1848-1849 in Germany, Engels expressly lumps the big and middle peasants together as
      “proprietors of more or less extensive farms, and each of them commanding the services of several agricultural
      laborers.” For, as he goes on to relate, they lumped themselves together politically in the situation:
    </div>
<div class="bq" id="ch12--306">
      This class [big and middle peasants taken together], placed between the large untaxed feudal landowners, and the
      smaller peasantry and farm laborers, for obvious reasons found in an alliance with the anti-feudal middle class
      of the towns its most natural political course.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch12--307"><a class="calibre14" id="ch12fn57"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch12fn57-r" id="ch12--309">57</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="noindentt" id="ch12--310">
      As late as 1869 Engels still wrote off the middle peasant, “who will also be reactionary and is not very
      numerous.”<sup class="calibre13" id="ch12--311"><a class="calibre14" id="ch12fn58"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch12fn58-r" id="ch12--313">58</a></sup> As we have seen, his expectations in this regard later became more flexible.
      But then, the middle peasantry itself is such a flexible classification that one can say little more about it in
      general than that, like intermediate strata in general, it consists of “iron filings” in a sense we have used
      before.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch12--314">
      There is still another analog with our discussion of the petty-bourgeoisie. We saw that the splitting of the
      artisan into “two persons” <a class="calibre6" id="page_336"></a>also applies to the independent peasant.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch12--316"><a class="calibre14" id="ch12fn59"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch12fn59-r" id="ch12--318">59</a></sup> In
      <em class="calibre8" id="ch12--319">Capital</em>, as already mentioned, Marx dissects the peasant more finely into three or four
      parts. When a small farmer
    </div>
<div class="bq" id="ch12--320">
      works for himself and sells his own product, he is first considered as his own employer (capitalist), who makes
      use of himself as a laborer, and second as his own landlord, who makes use of himself as his own tenant. To
      himself as wage-worker he pays wages, to himself as capitalist he gives the profit, and to himself as landlord he
      pays rent.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch12--321"><a class="calibre14" id="ch12fn60"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch12fn60-r" id="ch12--323">60</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="noindentt" id="ch12--324">
      Politically speaking, one may ask about this multiple economic persona: Which side is uppermost or dominant in
      any particular case or type of case? What forces, events, or circumstances move an aggregate of peasants to think
      of themselves as workers rather than as landowners or employers? This formulates a question for a concrete case
      investigation.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch12--325">
      To be sure, all this applies to some degree to the small peasant as well; but the middle peasant is doubly
      intermediate.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch12--326">
      The owner-peasant and the tenant farmer can be treated together in some cases: obviously there may be big and
      small among both; but the tenant farmer has to be separated out in certain political connections especially.
      Leaving aside the evident possibility of specific demands relevant only to the tenant’s situation, there is
      (thought Engels) likely to be a difference in their attitude to the bigger issue of land nationalization. Land
      nationalization means different things to the owner-peasant on the one hand, and, on the other, to “the tenant
      farmer, to whom it is a matter of indifference whether the land belongs to the state or to a large
      proprietor”<sup class="calibre13" id="ch12--327"><a class="calibre14" id="ch12fn61"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch12fn61-r" id="ch12--329">61</a></sup>—at any rate, as long as there is the possibility of renting it.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch12--330">
      Lastly, there are the rural workers who neither own nor rent land to till on their own, but hire out their labor
      to others: the day-laborers or farmhands, making up the agricultural proletariat. The rural proletariat may be
      understood to include craftsmen performing jobs auxiliary to agriculture, within the same milieu.<a class="calibre6" id="ch12en9-r"></a><a class="nounder1" href="43.html#ch12en9" id="ch12--332">*</a>

<h2 id="ch12lev6"><a class="calibre15" id="page_337"></a>6. HOSTILITY AND CONCERN</h2>
<div class="indent" id="ch12--335">
      One of the obstacles to understanding Marx’s and Engels’ political approach to the peasant question is an
      accompaniment of the “Marx against the peasant” myth, that is, the charge that they were irrationally biased and
      hostile to peasants, instead of being persuaded by a view of society derived from history and experience. There
      are few complaints so wide of the mark; it needs to be cleared up so that the substantive issues can be tackled
      fruitfully.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch12--336">
      In the first place, a depreciatory and scornful attitude toward peasants is so pervasive and deep-rooted in
      modern Western culture that it is simply diversionary to point a finger to Marx when he touches on it. The
      English language itself (like other Western languages) testifies to the common equation of peasant or
      peasant-serf status with stupidity, vice and ill repute; perhaps the best-known example is the etymology of
      <em class="calibre8" id="ch12--337">villain; boor</em> is another.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch12--338">
      There are two reasons for this tradition. One is a fact: the cultural backwardness attendant on peasant life (of
      which more later), especially as seen with urban or upper-class eyes that are incapable of a balanced historical
      view of the compensatory virtues of an alien culture. A second reason is the basic class antagonism toward the
      peasantry on the part of the two ruling classes that incubated the dominant ideas and pervasive conceptions of
      our epoch. For the landed aristocracy, the peasant was both a despicable object of exploitation, who could be
      squeezed all the more tranquilly by being demoted to a subhuman status, and also a continual danger that had to
      be brutally repressed. The bourgeoisie’s attitude toward the peasant had to be more ambivalent, especially in its
      period of struggle against the feudal rulers; but it was counterposed to the peasantry as an urban class buying
      its products, as well as the representatives of a system that had to crowd out part of the rural population and
      subject the rest to its own economic power. Indeed, one agrarian historian has ideological peasant-baiting coming
      in with the rise of the bourgeoisie, in the sixteenth century and after the German peasant war.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch12--339"><a class="calibre14" id="ch12fn64"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch12fn64-r" id="ch12--341">64</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="indent" id="ch12--342">
      For Marx, “hostility” to the peasant, as to the capitalist class, is a <a class="calibre6" id="page_338"></a>social question. The
      problem is not hostility to certain people; the problem is a social formation which is a fossil representative of
      an old and reactionary social order, which as a class stands in the way of a progressive modernization and
      humanization of society. Marx had no doubt that the peasantry had to be superseded, just as he had no doubt that
      the capitalist class had to be abolished: how, when, and by whom was another matter. If this is a form of
      hostility, let us remember that Marx held the same opinion <em class="calibre8" id="ch12--344">mutatis mutandis</em> about other
      classes, including the proto-proletarian class of artisanal workers and (in a different form) even the moderate
      proletariat as it exists today.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch12--345">
      The argument from psychological hostility is sterile. Marx’s central question about a social stratum was: <em class="calibre8" id="ch12--346">What can be expected from it in terms of helping or hindering the revolutionary transformation of
      society?</em> When a class (or a system) is obsolete, the historical problem is not merely to abolish it, but to
      transcend it, which means to carry over its enduring contributions and values in a higher form.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch12--347">
      More important is a related question: concern with and interest in the problems of the rural sector of society.
      It is generally true that the socialist movement at large has reflected and shared bourgeois society’s
      depreciation of the peasant world, and has historically devoted a minimum of attention to the countryside except
      for vote-catching. That socialist movements have mainly been urban-centered explains this if it does not justify
      it.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch12--348">
      But there are no socialist figures in the nineteenth century to whom this reproach applies less than to Marx and
      Engels.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch12--349">
      Even in terms of personal background, Marx’s upbringing in Trier should not be confused with that of socialists
      coming from urban jungles like London, New York, or Paris. Trier was a town dependent on a surrounding
      countryside; for example, it has been pointed out that many of the children with whom Marx went to school must
      have been from Moselle rural families.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch12--350"><a class="calibre14" id="ch12fn65"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch12fn65-r" id="ch12--352">65</a></sup> We have seen that the first economic questions in which he got involved,
      as a democratic journalist in 1842, dealt not with the workers but with the economic oppression of the Rhenish
      peasantry and country people, and that it was these issues that first oriented him toward socialism.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch12--353"><a class="calibre14" id="ch12fn66"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch12fn66-r" id="ch12--355">66</a></sup> While
      these considerations are not in the least decisive, from my own standpoint, they are at least as relevant as the
      ingredients of the “Marx against the peasant” legend.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch12--356">
      Engels, on the other hand, came from an industrial town and milieu; but Engels’ personal interest in peasant
      questions, however derived, was <a class="calibre6" id="page_339"></a>very great. The following indubitable statement will come as
      a surprise to all mythologists: <em class="calibre8" id="ch12--358">Up to his time at least, there is no figure in the history of
      socialism who wrote more extensively on the history and problems of the peasantry and the countryside.</em>
</div>
<div class="indent" id="ch12--359">
      We shall have occasion to mention some of his writings on the subject; and if many of them are little known and
      seldom quoted, that reflects not Engels but the socialist (urban) tradition of lack of interest in the
      question.<a class="calibre6" id="ch12en10-r"></a><a class="nounder1" href="43.html#ch12en10" id="ch12--361">*</a>

      It was not until the nineteenth century was nearing its end that the problem of catching rural votes for the
      growing Social-Democracies forced the peasantry into the consciousness of the parties, for opportunistic reasons.
      As Engels noted in 1894: “The bourgeois and reactionary parties greatly wonder why everywhere among Socialists
      the peasant question has now suddenly been placed upon the order of the day. What they should be wondering at, by
      rights, is that this has not been done long ago.”<sup class="calibre13" id="ch12--363"><a class="calibre14" id="ch12fn68"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch12fn68-r" id="ch12--365">68</a></sup>

      petty-bourgeois mentality; but an examination of some dozens of volumes of his collected works <a class="calibre6" id="page_340"></a>shows no special writing of note <em class="calibre8" id="ch12--374">about</em> the peasantry and its problems or

      were not guaranteed to make peasants happy.
    </div>
<h2 id="ch12lev7">7. HIKER’S VIEW</h2>
<div class="indent" id="ch12--379">
      Engels’ concern with and interest in the peasantry in human terms can be seen most clearly in a little-known
      manuscript in which he also developed most fully a social-psychological portrait of the mind of the peasant,
      associated with the political role played by the class.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch12--380">
      The context is very important. Threatened with arrest by the Prussian government in Cologne in the autumn of
      1848, Engels left the city for a while. Then, deported from Belgium, and after a short stay in a dark and dismal
      Paris, he started on foot through France on his way to Geneva and Bern. In an unfinished manuscript, he recorded
      his <em class="calibre8" id="ch12--381">Reise-bilder</em>—travel sketches—of the French countryside through which he walked, in a
      sort of holiday from revolution.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch12--382">
      The mood is usually gay, and the writer records a love affair with France: not the France of the capital city but
      the France of the countrypeople. He is enchanted by the glories of the wine, women, scenery, and food
      characteristic of peasant France; he is delighted with the bonhomie of its people, whom he keeps praising as
      against the Germans. “These peasants are a goodhumored, hospitable, cheerful people … bearers of many
      time-honored virtues …” and so on. He likes them as human beings. And it is in the midst of this eulogy of
      peasant France that he digresses to the one dark note that intrudes on his warm feeling for the people: the
      social mentality of the peasant.

      He begins by striking a note to which we will return in the next section:

<div class="bq1" id="ch12--384">
      But a peasant remains a peasant, and the conditions of existence of the peasants never cease making their
      influence felt. In spite of all the personal virtues of the French peasants, in spite of the fact that his living
      conditions are better developed than those of the peasants on the east bank of the Rhine, still in France as in
      Germany the peasant is the barbarian in the midst of civilization.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch12--385"><a class="calibre14" id="ch12fn72"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch12fn72-r" id="ch12--387">72</a></sup>

      The modern reader must understand that <em class="calibre8" id="ch12--389">barbarian</em> here is not a <a class="calibre6" id="page_341"></a>cuss-word but a historical reference to (then accepted) stages of civilization. The context has
      already made clear that the epithet is not a personal one. The reasons are the social conditions of life:

<div class="bq1" id="ch12--391">
      The isolation of the peasant in a secluded village with a small population that changes only with the
      generations, the arduous and monotonous work that binds him to the soil more than any serfdom and that always
      stays the same from father unto son, the fixity and sameness of all conditions of existence, the limited horizon
      in which the family becomes the most important and decisive relationship for him—all this reduces the peasant’s
      range of vision to the narrowest limits possible in modern society generally. The great movements of history pass
      over his head, from time to time carrying him away but without his having any idea of the nature of the motive
      force or its origin or end.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch12--392"><a class="calibre14" id="ch12fn73"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch12fn73-r" id="ch12--394">73</a></sup>

      The walker reviews the highlights of peasant movements from the Middle Ages to the revolution of 1830. In the
      French Revolution “the peasants were revolutionary … just until their property rights were made secure on the
      soil… Once these ends were attained, they turned with all the rage of their blindly grasping nature against the
      movement in the big cities which they could not understand, especially against the movement in Paris.” The
      peasant became a worshiper of Napoleon and a fanatical nationalist: “<em class="calibre8" id="ch12--396">la France</em> has had a
      lofty significance for him ever since he got hereditary possession of a piece of France.” He hates the foreigner
      fanatically because <em class="calibre8" id="ch12--397">l’étranger</em> means a ravaging invader. The Bourbon restoration
      threatened his land title; the July 1830 revolution consolidated it.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch12--398"><a class="calibre14" id="ch12fn74"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch12fn74-r" id="ch12--400">74</a></sup>

      Yet inevitably the peasant was bilked by the very developments he welcomed:
    </div>
<div class="bq1" id="ch12--402">
      But as always they enjoyed little of the fruits of victory. The bourgeoisie immediately began to exploit their
      rural allies with all the strength at their disposal. The fact that the soil could be parcelled out and divided
      up bore fruit—in the form of the impoverishment of the peasants and the mortgaging of their pieces of land—which
      had already begun ripening under the Restoration. After 1830 these results appeared in more and more generalized
      and threatening forms. But the pressure that big capital exerted on the peasant remained for him simply a
      personal relationship between him and his creditor; he did not and could not see that this more and more
      generalized and regularized <a class="calibre6" id="page_342"></a>relationship was gradually developing into a class relationship
      between the class of big capitalists and the class of small landholders.

      We peasants have to save France, they decide; and that means supporting Bonaparte. Enthusiasm for Bonaparte and

<div class="indent" id="ch12--439">
      The Greeks had a word for the kind of social mentality that Engels was describing in his travel sketches: the
      privatized person, withdrawn from public concerns, <em class="calibre8" id="ch12--440">apolitical</em> in the original sense of
      isolation from the sociopolitical community of the larger whole. The word was <em class="calibre8" id="ch12--441">idiotes.</em>
</div>
<div class="indent" id="ch12--442">
      In English the word <em class="calibre8" id="ch12--443">idiot</em> lost its Greek meaning many centuries ago. In German the
      etymological meaning was retained until well into the nineteenth century. What then did the classical scholar
      Marx mean when, just before the midpoint of the century, he wrote into the <em class="calibre8" id="ch12--444">Communist
      Manifesto</em> a remark about <em class="calibre8" id="ch12--445">dem Idiotismus des Landlebens</em>, that is, about the
      privatized apartness of rural life? It is highly doubtful that his meaning is adequately summed up by “the idiocy
      of rural life”—the phrase that translated it forty years later.<a class="calibre6" id="ch12en12-r"></a><a class="nounder1" href="43.html#ch12en12" id="ch12--447">*</a>

<a class="calibre6" id="page_345"></a>The Manifesto had a different point to make—one that might be equally unpalatable to
      idealizers of the peasantry, but that requires to be understood. The peasant population stood outside modern
      civilization within a nation, just as industrially retarded nations stand outside the current of modern
      civilization in the world. Civilization here means, in social and class terms, nothing else than the most
      advanced society then in existence, the developed bourgeois civilization of the West. For, says the Manifesto,
      through its massive urbanization the bourgeoisie
    </div>
<div class="bq" id="ch12--450">
      has thus rescued a considerable part of the population from the <em class="calibre8" id="ch12--451">Idiotismus</em> of rural life.
      Just as it has made the country dependent on the towns, so it has made barbarian and semibarbarian countries
      dependent on the civilized ones, nations of peasants on nations of bourgeois, the East on the West.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch12--452"><a class="calibre14" id="ch12fn84"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch12fn84-r" id="ch12--454">84</a></sup>

      Greek civilization; to Marx, it refers to the advanced bourgeois civilization celebrated in the Manifesto.) It

      Another part of the context to keep in mind is that the cultural <a class="calibre6" id="page_346"></a>deformation of an isolated
      rural population is one aspect of the separation of town and country which has been brought to a high pitch by
      capitalism (as we shall discuss in Volume 3). But this separation of town and country does not leave the urban
      population undeformed:
    </div>
<div class="bq" id="ch12--468">
      The contradiction between town and country … is the most crass expression of the subjection of the individual
      under the division of labor … a subjection which makes one man into a restricted town-animal, another into a

      Part of the deformation suffered by the industrial worker, observed Marx in <em class="calibre8" id="ch12--473">Capital</em>, is
      that he loses the need to exercise the “knowledge, the judgment, and the will, which, though in ever so small a
      degree, are practised by the independent peasant or handicraftsman, in the same way as the savage makes the whole
      art of war consist in the exercise of his personal cunning.” As a result, “intelligence in production” tends to
      be more concentrated in the employing capital than in the worker.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch12--474"><a class="calibre14" id="ch12fn88"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch12fn88-r" id="ch12--476">88</a></sup> (This is not an insult to
      the proletariat.) For such reasons, wrote Engels in 1873, the socialist abolition of the separation between town
      and country is necessary for the health of both industry and agriculture. On the basis of the abolition of
      capitalism, it “will be able to deliver the rural population from the isolation and stupor in which it has
      vegetated almost unchanged for thousands of years.”<sup class="calibre13" id="ch12--477"><a class="calibre14" id="ch12fn89"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch12fn89-r" id="ch12--479">89</a></sup>

      “Rural population” includes more than the peasantry. The mentality of the precapitalist countryside was by no

      The small-holding peasants form a vast mass, the members of which live in similar conditions but without entering
      into manifold relations with one another. Their mode of production isolates them from one another instead of
      bringing them into mutual intercourse. The isolation is increased by France’s bad means of communication and by
      the poverty of the peasants. Their field of production, the small holding, admits of no division of labor in its
      cultivation, no application of science and, therefore, no diversity of development, no variety of talent, no
      wealth of social relationships. Each individual peasant family is almost self-sufficient; it itself directly
      produces the major part of its consumption and thus acquires its means of life more through exchange with nature
      than in intercourse with society. A small holding, a peasant and his family; alongside them another small
      holding, another peasant and another family. A few score of these make up a village; and a few score of villages
      make up a Department. In this way, the great mass of the French nation is formed by simple addition of homologous

      Marx wrote this while the peasants were being wielded as a semiconscious battering ram in the hands of Bonaparte
      to destroy the Third Republic. Bonapartism was not a peasant movement, though it utilized the movement of the
      peasants; and Bonaparte was not a peasant leader, though he led the peasants by the nose. The peasantry, as
      usual, was a tool.

<div class="indent" id="ch12--543">
      This view of the political role of the peasantry was seen clearly by Engels even before 1848 and its experiences;
      and he expressed it even as he was proposing the idea of a proletarian bloc with the peasantry and
      petty-bourgeoisie (as explained in <a class="nounder1" href="15.html#ch07" id="ch12--544">Chapter 7</a>). The idea
      of an alliance was not based on illusions. The small peasants, wrote Engels in 1847, <a class="calibre6" id="page_350"></a>can be

      they are also thoroughly incapable of all historical initiative. Even their emancipation from the chains of
      serfdom comes about only under the protection of the bourgeoisie. Where the absence of both nobility and
      bourgeoisie permits it to rule, as in the mountain cantons of Switzerland and in Norway, there also rule
      prefeudal barbarism, local narrowmindedness, stuffy fanatical bigotry and faithful rectitude. Where, as in
      Germany, the nobility still remains in existence along with the peasantry, the latter are squeezed in between
      nobility and bourgeoisie just like the petty-bourgeoisie. In order to protect the interests of agriculture
      against the growing power of trade and industry, they must ally themselves with the nobility. In order to
      safeguard themselves from the overweening competition of the nobility and especially of bourgeois landowners,
      they must ally themselves with the bourgeoisie. Which side they finally join depends on the nature of their
      property. The big peasants of eastern Germany, who themselves exercise a certain amount of feudal authority over
      their farm-hands, are too closely connected in all their interests with the nobility to think seriously of
      cutting loose from them. The small landholders in the west who arose out of the splitting-up of the nobility’s
      estates, and the small peasants in the east who are subject to corvée labor service, are too directly oppressed
      by, or stand too directly in opposition to, the nobility not to join the side of the bourgeoisie.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch12--547"><a class="calibre14" id="ch12fn102"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch12fn102-r" id="ch12--549">102</a></sup>

      A class with the characteristics described in this chapter could, to be sure, become a revolutionary force of a
      certain type, and it could become part of a revolutionary bloc, but history showed that even in its best times
      its revolutionary activity was spasmodic. Usually it was <a class="calibre6" id="page_352"></a>politically passive. At worst, and
      not infrequently, it went into action as the tool of reaction.

<div class="indent" id="ch12--579">
      Given its normal apathy, the peasantry was <em class="calibre8" id="ch12--580">par excellence</em> the class on which
      thoroughgoing despotisms based themselves. Generalizing on the pattern by which Bonaparte rode into power on the
      backs of the peasantry, Marx wrote, continuing a passage which we have already quoted:
    </div>
<div class="bq" id="ch12--581">
      They [the peasants] cannot represent themselves, they must be represented. Their representative must at the same
      time appear as their master, as an authority over them, as an unlimited governmental power that protects them
      against the other classes and sends them rain and sunshine from above. The political influence of the
      small-holding peasants, therefore, finds its final expression in the executive power subordinating society to
      itself.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch12--582"><a class="calibre14" id="ch12fn109"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch12fn109-r" id="ch12--584">109</a></sup>

      A peasant infrastructure tends to produce a bureaucratic superstructure. Marx explains the seeming paradox:
    </div>
<div class="bq" id="ch12--586">
      By its very nature, small-holding property forms a suitable basis for an all-powerful and innumerable
      bureaucracy. It creates a uniform level of relationships and persons over the whole surface of the land. Hence it
      also permits of uniform action from a supreme center on all points of this uniform mass. It annihilates the
      aristocratic intermediate grades between the mass of the people and the state power. On all sides, therefore, it
      calls forth the direct interference of this state power and the interposition of its immediate organs. Finally,
      it produces an unemployed surplus population for which there is no place either on the land or in the towns, and
      which accordingly reaches out for state offices as a sort of respectable alms, and provokes the creation of state
      posts.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch12--587"><a class="calibre14" id="ch12fn110"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch12fn110-r" id="ch12--589">110</a></sup>

      It is, then, the “decentralization” of peasant society (its dispersion and atomization) that nourishes the
      monstrous overcentralization of this state. It is the “equality” of the underlying population (the “uniform
      level” of a uniform mass) that forms the basis of the tremendous hierarchization of the “unlimited governmental
      power.” It is the “independence” of the small cultivators—from each other as well as from the rest of
      society—that renders them helplessly dependent on a savior-master. These pairs of opposites, which abstractly
      seem so flatly <a class="calibre6" id="page_353"></a>incompatible, are united in the concrete context, like the two sides of a

      From French Bonapartism to Oriental despotism: Marx made the connection in the few years following the

      between the peasants’ conditions of existence and certain types of highly bureaucratized despotism—was spelled
      out in the course of his investigations into Indian and Chinese society and the Russian czarist state, and has
      been set forth in considerable detail in our Volume 1.<a class="calibre6" id="ch12en16-r"></a><a class="nounder1" href="43.html#ch12en16" id="ch12--597">**</a>

      Oriental despotism—the political structure resting on the localized, atomized peasant communities of what Marx
      called the “archaic formation” of society, or the “Asiatic” mode of production—is the best exemplification of the
      unity of opposites that Marx first analyzed in the quite different society of the Second Empire. Here, in a
      different mode of production, was the little world of the peasant <em class="calibre8" id="ch12--599">idiotes.</em> A working
      definition of <em class="calibre8" id="ch12--600">Idiotismus</em> can virtually be derived from some key points in Marx’s
      descriptions of the conditions from which despotism arose. Let us recall some typical elements, at the expense of
      some repetition.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch12--601">
      The empire, united by the central power, might be huge, but “the whole empire, not counting the few larger towns,
      was divided into <em class="calibre8" id="ch12--602">villages</em>, each of which possessed a completely separate organization and
      formed a little world in itself.”<sup class="calibre13" id="ch12--603"><a class="calibre14" id="ch12fn112"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch12fn112-r" id="ch12--605">112</a></sup> The people were “dispersed … over the surface of the country, and

      Hence they were easy prey for conquest by successive invaders “who founded their empires on the passive basis of
      the unresisting and unchanging society,” whose “worst feature” was “the dissolution of society into stereotype
      [i.e., uniform] and disconnected atoms.”<sup class="calibre13" id="ch12--609"><a class="calibre14" id="ch12fn114"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch12fn114-r" id="ch12--611">114</a></sup> The village <a class="calibre6" id="page_354"></a>communities seemed to be

      the solid foundation of Oriental despotism, that they restrained the human mind within the smallest possible

      all grandeur and historical energies. We must not forget the barbarian egotism [cf. <em class="calibre8" id="ch12--617">Idiotismus</em>] which, concentrating on some miserable patch of land, had quietly witnessed the ruin

      Both Marx and Engels, we also saw, applied this approach liberally to the Russian state. Marx emphasized the
      isolation of the Russian peasant commune: “its isolation, the lack of liaison between the life of one commune and
      the others’—this <em class="calibre8" id="ch12--622">localized microcosm</em> … which, wherever it is found, has given rise to a

<div class="bq" id="ch12--626">
      Such a complete isolation of the individual [village] communities from one another, which creates throughout the

      despotism</em>, and from India to Russia this form of society, wherever it prevailed, has always produced it and
      always found its complement in it.

      Czarist despotism, he added, was “the necessary and logical product of Russian social conditions” of this

<div class="indent" id="ch12--640">
      In periods of apathy, the peasantry provided a passive base for rule. But the peasants could also be ridden in
      the name of revolution—someone else’s revolution. For example, Engels explained that Russian czarism had carried
      this maneuver out in order to annex Poland—“in the name of the right of revolution, arming the [Polish] serfs
      against their masters.” He continued:

      which being once accomplished the same Russian soldiers put the serfs back again under the yoke of their

      Riding the peasantry has another side. It has often been accompanied by a “cult of the peasant”—an idealization
      and glorification of peasant and rural virtues—usually by urban intellectuals. This propagandistic idealization
      is the reverse side of the real exploitation of the peasantry, especially when it is useful to hold their virtues
      up as a model for a rebellious working class. This combination of cultism and exploitation has been seen from
      ancient Greece to Mussolini’s Italy and more modern dictatorships in peasant countries.<a class="calibre6" id="ch12en17-r"></a><a class="nounder1" href="43.html#ch12en17" id="ch12--648">*</a> A close analog is the Western

<a class="calibre6" id="page_356"></a>In Marx’s time, it was Bakunin who was the most prominent representative of this
      combination. This feature of the anarchist founder was duly noticed and highlighted when Marx, Engels, and Paul
      Lafargue worked on a pamphlet in 1873 to expose the way in which the Bakuninist faction had bored from within to
      rule or ruin the International. They aimed a shaft at a notorious article Bakunin had published in 1862 as an
      appeal to the Russian czar to make the social revolution at the head of the People. “We would prefer to follow
      Romanoff, if Romanoff could and would transform himself from a Petersburg [that is, urban and Westernized]
      emperor into a peasant czar,” Bakunin had written.<a class="calibre6" id="ch12en18-r"></a><a class="nounder1" href="43.html#ch12en18" id="ch12--655">*</a>
</div>
<div class="indent" id="ch12--656">
      Bakunin’s peasant cultism was calculated. What he glorified in the peasantry was precisely its “barbarism,” he
      often said, and his view of that class was very similar to Marx’s—except standing on its head. All of the
      characteristics which for Marx made the peasantry unsuitable as a class revolutionary vanguard were, for Bakunin,
      precisely the reasons for adopting it as his chosen instrument of pandestruction (along with the lumpen-class).
      It could be used in the fashion traditional to would-be despots.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch12--657"><a class="calibre14" id="ch12fn126"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch12fn126-r" id="ch12--659">126</a></sup>

      The Engels-Lafargue-Marx pamphlet then makes the connection between Russian despotism and Bonapartism in its last
      words: “After this piece of brainwork by the master prostrating himself before his peasant czar, it was surely in

      However, the Bakunin counterpart of Bonapartist socialism was not so much czarist socialism (whatever that might
      be imagined to be) but rather <em class="calibre8" id="ch12--665">peasant socialism.</em> For Marx, this belonged in the same
      category as the “reactionary socialism” and “petty-bourgeois socialism” analyzed in the <em class="calibre8" id="ch12--666">Communist Manifesto.</em> He had occasion to emphasize this in marginal notes on Bakunin’s book
      <em class="calibre8" id="ch12--667">Statism and Anarchy.</em> These notes were somewhat telegraphic jottings set down for his own
      eyes only, hence not well developed, but in one such passage Marx suggested why <a class="calibre6" id="page_357"></a>the
      conception of a progressive social revolution based on the peasantry was a mirage:
    </div>
<div class="bq" id="ch12--669">
      A radical social revolution is bound up with certain historical conditions of economic development; the latter
      are its prerequisite. It is therefore possible only where, along with capitalist production, the industrial
      proletariat at least occupies an important position among the mass of the people. … [But Bakunin] understands
      absolutely nothing about social revolution—only its political phrases; its economic conditions do not exist for
      him. Now since all hitherto existing economic forms, developed or undeveloped, involve the subjection of workers
      (be it in the form of wage-workers, peasants, etc.), he believes that in all of them a <em class="calibre8" id="ch12--670">radical
      revolution</em> is equally possible. But even more! He wants the European social revolution which is founded on
      the economic basis of capitalist production to be carried out on the level of the Russian or Slavic agricultural
      and pastoral peoples and not go beyond this level …<sup class="calibre13" id="ch12--671"><a class="calibre14" id="ch12fn128"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch12fn128-r" id="ch12--673">128</a></sup>
