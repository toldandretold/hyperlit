<div class="indent" id="ch02--2">
      A discussion of the political problems of proletarian revolution requires some clarification on a number of
      points in Marx’s social theory. The following summary covers a number of controversial questions by stating
      Marx’s view.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch02--3">
      We have used <em class="calibre8" id="ch02--4">proletariat</em> so far with the broad meaning of wageworkers, especially in order
      to differentiate it from the early history of the word.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch02--5"><a class="calibre14" id="ch02fn1"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch02fn1-r" id="ch02--7">1</a></sup> It is necessary now to be more exact, not so much for the sake
      of scientific accuracy as in order to dispense with some common misunderstandings of the political import of
      proletarian revolution. Marx’s attitude toward precise definition in political terminology was typical of his day
      in being relatively permissive as compared with contemporary standards; but he grew more inclined to precision at
      least in the field of economic science. We saw this reflected in his increased care to distinguish between
      <em class="calibre8" id="ch02--8">proletariat</em> and <em class="calibre8" id="ch02--9">working class</em> on at least one occasion.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch02--10"><a class="calibre14" id="ch02fn2"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch02fn2-r" id="ch02--12">2</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="indent" id="ch02--13">
      Part of the problem was that, although <em class="calibre8" id="ch02--14">proletarian</em> was already in use as a term broader
      than <em class="calibre8" id="ch02--15">worker</em>,<sup class="calibre13" id="ch02--16"><a class="calibre14" id="ch02fn3"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch02fn3-r" id="ch02--18">3</a></sup> Marx came to assign a narrower scope to it by a terminological outcome of his
      economic theory. Over the span of Marx’s life, socialist literature attached a whole spectrum of meaning to the
      word. A good example of the broad end of the spectrum was in a programmatic statement of the Communist League,
      probably written by Schapper, shortly before the <em class="calibre8" id="ch02--19">Communist Manifesto:</em> “In present-day
      society proletarians are all those who cannot live on their capital, the worker as well as the men of learning,
      the artist as well as the petty-bourgeois …”<sup class="calibre13" id="ch02--20"><a class="calibre14" id="ch02fn4"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch02fn4-r" id="ch02--22">4</a></sup> Behind this unworkably broad usage, as also the usage by
      others,<sup class="calibre13" id="ch02--23"><a class="calibre14" id="ch02fn5"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch02fn5-r" id="ch02--25">5</a></sup> was the strong honorific coloration that the word was intended to convey in these
      circles. Actually the real sense was a negative: all who were not idlers. Terminologically it raised <a class="calibre6" id="page_34"></a>the banner of a united front by disparate social elements against the ruling minority. Although the
      origins of this kind of honorific aura around <em class="calibre8" id="ch02--27">proletarian</em> are pre-Marxist and
      non-Marxist,<a class="calibre6" id="ch02en1-r"></a><a class="nounder1" href="43.html#ch02en1" id="ch02--29">*</a> its effects
      linger on in Marxist literature.
    </div>
<h2 id="ch02lev1">1. ECONOMIC DEFINITION</h2>
<div class="indent" id="ch02--31">
      In Marx’s theory, the proletariat is the working class peculiar to capitalist relations of production. It does
      not comprise all who work for a living, or who do useful or necessary work. It consists of workers whose
      livelihood depends on a wage relationship with employers of labor power, and who therefore produce surplus value
      in the process of commodity production.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch02--32">
      Thus the term <em class="calibre8" id="ch02--33">proletariat</em> is not coterminous with a number of other expressions that are
      often used synonymously.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch02--34">
      • The proletariat does not include all wage-workers. For example, it does not include wage-workers employed by
      government—road-building workers, in one example by Marx<sup class="calibre13" id="ch02--35"><a class="calibre14" id="ch02fn6"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch02fn6-r" id="ch02--37">6</a></sup>—since strictly speaking they do not produce surplus value in
      the course of commodity production.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch02--38">
      • The proletariat does not consist only of industrial workers (whatever that descriptive term is taken to
      comprise). Surplus value is produced in the course of other types of commodity production.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch02--39">
      • The proletariat does not consist only of manual workers. There is a whole sphere of intellectual or mental
      labor which is as proletarian as any other. (We will return to this in <a class="nounder1" href="25.html#ch16" id="ch02--40">Chapter 16</a>.)
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch02--41">
      • The proletariat does not consist only of workers “at the point of production” (again, however that phrase is
      interpreted). For example, transportation may contribute to the surplus value of the transported commodity; and a
      truck driver may be as proletarian as an assembly-line hand.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch02--42">
      • The proletariat does not consist only of workers engaged in producing tangible commodities. Producers of
      services (nonmaterial commodities) may also be producing surplus value. To take an example <a class="calibre6" id="page_35"></a>which combines this and a previous point: a salaried teacher in a privately owned school that is
      run as a profit-making enterprise is producing surplus value for the employer.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch02--44">
      Some of the above points restrict the technical coverage of the term more than is commonly realized. There is a
      final point to be made which expands it significantly.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch02--45">
      • The basic unit of the proletariat in capitalist production, considered structurally, is not any individual but
      the <em class="calibre8" id="ch02--46">collective laborer.</em> This term of Marx’s refers to the ensemble of workers whose labor
      taken together is necessary to produce a given commodity. It may be a small number (rarely one!) or a very large
      collectivity; but, more important, it commonly unites both manual and intellectual (mental) labor specialties,
      both labor at the point of production and away from the factory, both labor expended directly on the product and
      labor indirectly associated with the necessities of production (like floor-sweeping). It also includes
      supervisory labor of any type necessary to the production of the commodity. No one of this collectivity is
      responsible for the value embodied in the commodity; all of them are collectively. There is no basis for
      distinguishing between proletarian and nonproletarian constituents of the collective laborer; all of them are
      members of the proletariat.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch02--47">
      The bourgeois-proletarian antagonism on which Marx bases the modern class struggle is, then, not represented by
      the dichotomy between dirt-splattered, horny-handed, blue-collared toilers and clean-shirted, chair-warming paper
      manipulators. The latter is a bourgeois conception, that is, it arises from class conceptions of social
      antagonisms that are cherished by the ruling class as a self-serving stereotype or caricature of the real world.
      This remains true even when it is inverted, that is, when the horny-handed lower-class image is idealized by
      alienated bourgeois who wish to break with their class.
    </div>
<h2 id="ch02lev2">2. WORKING-CLASS CIRCLES</h2>
<div class="indent" id="ch02--49">
      One present importance of emphasizing the narrow economic meaning of <em class="calibre8" id="ch02--50">proletariat</em> to Marx
      is to shake up common misunderstandings. Thus, it is true that, technically, an editorial supervisor of the
      <em class="calibre8" id="ch02--51">Encyclopaedia Britannica</em> may be a proletarian while a Navy Yard shipfitter is <a class="calibre6" id="page_36"></a>not. But marginal consequences of this extreme sort are not typical of the sociopolitical role
      played by proletarian elements as against nonproletarian strata. The example calls attention to the need for the
      next step: a concrete examination of the relationship between an economic stratum as such and its social role,
      and hence the tendency of its relationship to the political class struggle.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch02--53">
      Obviously the encyclopedia editor, even if technically a proletarian, will tend to react socially and politically
      quite differently from a factory hand. Marx’s conception of revolution simply puts forward the following
      proposition. Objective class status is the most important single determinant of sociopolitical role in the long
      run; and of the various class situations, that of the proletariat tends to drive most consistently toward a break
      with bourgeois relations.
    </div>
<div class="bq" id="ch02--54">
      Not in vain does it [the proletariat] go through the stern but steeling school of <em class="calibre8" id="ch02--55">labor.</em>
      It is not a question of what this or that proletarian, or even the whole proletariat, at the moment <em class="calibre8" id="ch02--56">regards</em> as its aim. It is a question of <em class="calibre8" id="ch02--57">what the proletariat is</em>, and what,
      in accordance with this <em class="calibre8" id="ch02--58">being</em>, it will historically be compelled to do. Its aim and
      historical action is visibly and irrevocably foreshadowed in its life situation as well as in the whole
      organization of bourgeois society today.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch02--59"><a class="calibre14" id="ch02fn7"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch02fn7-r" id="ch02--61">7</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="noindent" id="ch02--62">
      This was written before the young Marx had got very far with his economic investigation of “the whole
      organization of bourgeois society.” But it already roots the revolutionary role of the proletariat in its life
      situation, the objective relations that condition its social existence. Engels said no more when, much later, he
      described the proletariat as “a class whose conditions of life necessarily drive it to social
      revolution.”<sup class="calibre13" id="ch02--63"><a class="calibre14" id="ch02fn8"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch02fn8-r" id="ch02--65">8</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="indent" id="ch02--66">
      A social analysis of the relation between classes and politics will, however, not normally show a simple duel
      situation. The duel pattern implies a highly polarized conjuncture such as commonly occurs at the end of a
      development, not at its beginning. For a better schema, let us resort to the metaphor implied by the phrase
      <em class="calibre8" id="ch02--67">social circles.</em> You are invited to think of a system of concentric circles, with
      surrounding areas. Here the main body of the proletariat is to be seen as a core group, occupying a central
      position with relation to the revolutionary drives within society.

<div class="indent" id="ch02--68">
      In the accompanying schematic diagram, one aim is to illustrate the fact that revolution entails the setting into
      motion of ever-expanding circles of society. The strategic position to set these circles into motion is occupied
      by the proletariat: such is Marx’s view—“the proletarians created by large-scale industry assume leadership of
      this movement and carry the whole mass along with them …”<sup class="calibre13" id="ch02--69"><a class="calibre14" id="ch02fn9"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch02fn9-r" id="ch02--71">9</a></sup>

        The “middle classes” (in the residual sense) are suggested by the irregular white area lying vaguely between

<a class="calibre6" id="page_38"></a>The relations among classes, class strata, and class elements in revolution involve, of
      course, far more than the bare bones of class definition. The underlying demarcations of class merely provide a
      framework for their social interactions. From this standpoint our emphasis will be on the main body of the
      proletariat <em class="calibre8" id="ch02--92">plus</em> those sections of the population whose life situations in society tend to
      be similar. (This consideration will be concretized in subsequent chapters.) It is this combination which tends
      to be called the working classes, or even the working class, in Marx’s writings—a term, therefore, which is best
      regarded as not narrowly technical-economic but as a socially extended penumbra around the proletariat. Let us
      specify now that when Marx leaves the specific ground of economic science in his discussions, and especially when
      the context is political affairs, the terms <em class="calibre8" id="ch02--93">proletariat</em>, <em class="calibre8" id="ch02--94">workers</em>,
      or <em class="calibre8" id="ch02--95">working class</em> tend to denote this same combination.
    </div>
<h2 id="ch02lev3">3. VANGUARD AND ALLIES</h2>
<div class="indent" id="ch02--97">
      When Marx wrote in the <em class="calibre8" id="ch02--98">Communist Manifesto</em> that the proletarian revolution, unlike the
      bourgeois, was the “movement of the immense majority,” it was an anticipative formula. In almost all countries,
      insofar as the proletarian revolution was the movement of a majority, it could not be the movement of the
      proletariat only but of the proletariat and its allies, namely, those social circles it could set in motion. “The
      class exclusively dependent on wages all its life is still far from being a majority of the German people,” wrote
      Engels in 1870. “It is, therefore, also compelled to seek allies.”<sup class="calibre13" id="ch02--99"><a class="calibre14" id="ch02fn10"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch02fn10-r" id="ch02--101">10</a></sup> And he proceeded to weigh
      the worth of various class elements as allies. We shall do so in <a class="nounder1" href="14.html#part02" id="ch02--102">Part II</a>.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch02--103">
      In 1848-1849 the gravamen of Marx and Engels’ policies in the revolution was the problem of allies, as we shall
      see. The revolutionary movement collapsed over this problem, over “the incoherence, incongruence and apparent
      contradiction which prevailed in that movement” as a consequence of the crisscrossing pulls of the various social
      sectors:
    </div>
<div class="bq" id="ch02--104">
<a class="calibre6" id="page_39"></a>°°When interests so varied, so conflicting, so strangely crossing each other, are brought
      into violent collision; when these contending interests in every district, every province, are mixed in different
      proportions; when, above all, there is no great centre in the country … what else is to be expected but that the
      contest will dissolve itself into a mass of unconnected struggles, in which an enormous quantity of blood,
      energy, and capital is spent, but which for all that remain without any decisive results?<sup class="calibre13" id="ch02--106"><a class="calibre14" id="ch02fn11"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch02fn11-r" id="ch02--108">11</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="noindent" id="ch02--109">
      What was lacking in this failed revolution was precisely the pattern of a vanguard class successfully drawing all
      its allies after it.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch02--110">
      This standpoint provides a very important qualification to the bird’s-eye view embodied in the <em class="calibre8" id="ch02--111">Communist Manifesto’s</em> vivid picture that “Society as a whole is more and more splitting up into
      two great hostile camps, into two great classes directly facing each other: bourgeoisie and proletariat.”<sup class="calibre13" id="ch02--112"><a class="calibre14" id="ch02fn12"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch02fn12-r" id="ch02--114">12</a></sup> This
      picture emphasizes the long-term trend toward increasing polarization. But in shorter-range terms, a decisive
      problem of each polar class is to attract and hold class allies and to neutralize others. The proletarian
      revolution depends not on the proletariat alone, but on the hegemony of the proletariat among the revolutionary
      forces.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch02--115">
      A one-sided dogmatization of this Manifesto aphorism was turned by the Lassallean movement into the watchword
      that, relative to the working class, “all other classes are only one reactionary mass.” Both Marx and Engels
      ridiculed this apparently “radical” assertion and denounced it as politically reactionary. It meant the defeat of
      revolution by excluding allies. (This issue will be discussed at large in <a class="nounder1" href="19.html#ch11" id="ch02--116">Chapter 11</a>.)
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch02--117">
      The social revolution would not be made by the proletariat <em class="calibre8" id="ch02--118">solus</em>, and there was no need
      to wait until the development of society had made the proletariat a majority by itself, nor even to expect that
      such an extreme point might be reached. To be sure, the social revolution was possible only where the proletariat
      had come to occupy “at least an important position among the mass of people,” Marx wrote,<sup class="calibre13" id="ch02--119"><a class="calibre14" id="ch02fn13"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch02fn13-r" id="ch02--121">13</a></sup> but
      this was so because only such a proletariat could hope to head a revolutionary class alliance. It was the
      proletarian-dominated alliance which he expected to be the mass basis of the social transformation.
    </div>
<h2 id="ch02lev4"><a class="calibre15" id="page_40"></a>4. WHY THE PROLETARIAT?</h2>
<div class="indent" id="ch02--124">
      What is there in the life situation of the working class that causes Marx to regard it as the historically
      nominated hard core of modern revolution?
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch02--125">
      The answer has nothing to do with idealizing workers as such; it does not depend on regarding workers as somehow
      better, or more clever, courageous, or humanitarian than other people. Nor is it relevant to prove, as can be
      done with ease, that workers often follow reactionary courses and leaders and by no means show an invariable
      affinity for progressive causes. They are at least as capable of being misled and deceived as any other section
      of society (including intellectuals). They are filled with selfish aspirations and unworthy prejudices like
      everyone else. If this were the sort of thing involved, the case would not only be closed—it could never have
      been opened.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch02--126">
      Taking workers person for person as individuals, the question whether they are better than others because they
      belong to an anointed class is quite alien to Marx’s method of inquiry. In general Marx does not view social
      conflicts as contests between Good People and Bad People. The capitalists pilloried in <em class="calibre8" id="ch02--127">Capital</em> for their callous disregard of the suffering caused by brutal exploitation were just as
      likely to be kind parents and generous friends as the next person, and not given to trampling down children in
      the street. People act one way as individual atoms in the social fabric; they often act quite differently as part
      of a class collectivity. The bourgeois explanation is “Business is business”— which means that one must make a
      sharp distinction between an individual-human role and a class-constrained role. The life situation of
      capitalists also determines a class role, with class characteristics that cannot be deduced simply from the sum
      total of individual psychologies.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch02--128">
      Like every other class and organic social group, the proletariat is more than the sum of its individual atoms.
      The working class is <em class="calibre8" id="ch02--129">atomized</em> when it is unorganized. Class organization brings class
      characteristics to the fore, and, as a function of organization, class characteristics increasingly take
      precedence over merely individual reactions, the greater the scale of class involvement. Then, in a feedback
      effect, class reactions can also reshape and reeducate individual reactions. Thus class-consciousness develops.
      When Marx was in a mind for Hegelian phraseology, the atomized class was a “class in itself” (<em class="calibre8" id="ch02--130">an sich</em>) but <a class="calibre6" id="page_41"></a>became a “class for itself” (<em class="calibre8" id="ch02--132">für sich</em>)
      insofar as it organized into a social entity and achieved consciousness of its social and political role in the
      course of struggle.<a class="calibre6" id="ch02en2-r"></a><a class="nounder1" href="43.html#ch02en2" id="ch02--134">*</a>
</div>
<div class="indent" id="ch02--135">
      All this, for Marx, is a historical process, not a static mystique. “Revolutionariness” does not reside in the
      substance of the proletariat like sanctity in the Holy Ghost; the notion that every proletarian is immanently
      more revolutionary than the unanointed at any given time or place has no more to do with Marx than muttering a
      paternoster. The conditions of existence of the working class provide the connection between the economic
      position of the class and its political tendencies; “the proletariat is revolutionary in accordance with its
      whole [social] position …”<sup class="calibre13" id="ch02--136"><a class="calibre14" id="ch02fn15"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch02fn15-r" id="ch02--138">15</a></sup>

<div class="indent" id="ch02--139">
      The historical advantages possessed by the working class for the role of revolutionary vanguard may be summarized
      as follows.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch02--140">

      Its class propensity to organize is outstanding. The model and pioneer in this respect is the capitalist class
      itself, whose own classconsciousness and sense of class solidarity have often been inspirations to its workers.
      But then, the capitalists are the other urban class organized by modern industry. Agrarian populations are unable
      to rival the achievements of the urban classes, by reason of their own conditions of existence. “The dispersion
      of the rural laborers over larger areas breaks their power of resistance while concentration increases that of
      the town operatives,” observes Marx in <em class="calibre8" id="ch02--144">Capital.</em><sup class="calibre13" id="ch02--145"><a class="calibre14" id="ch02fn16"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch02fn16-r" id="ch02--147">16</a></sup> A similar contrast

      Workers are taught organization not by their superior intelligence or by outside agitators, but by the
      capitalists. Concentrated geographically in urban areas, workers are further organized in factory gangs, assembly
      lines, work shifts, labor teams, and so on—that is, by the organization of the division of labor, to which
      capitalism has contributed so mightily. Capitalism has no choice about teaching its workers the wonders of
      organization and labor solidarity, because without these the system cannot operate. Capital “assembles the
      bourgeois and the proletarians <a class="calibre6" id="page_42"></a>in large cities, in which industry can be carried on most
      profitably, and by this herding together of great masses in <em class="calibre8" id="ch02--150">one</em> spot makes the
      proletarians conscious of their power.”<sup class="calibre13" id="ch02--151"><a class="calibre14" id="ch02fn17"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch02fn17-r" id="ch02--153">17</a></sup> It expounds the need for discipline, and at the same time involuntarily
      demonstrates the defects of bureaucratic discipline. It enforces centralization of effort, and glorifies the
      advantages of combined labor and the subordination of individual self-interest to group needs. It socializes
      masses of workers in one place and subjects them to simultaneous resentments. The working class can say: “The
      <em class="calibre8" id="ch02--154">organization</em> you teach me I will execute, and it shall go hard but I will better the
      instruction.”
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch02--155">
      It is evident that these lessons are not taught equally to all workers, even apart from the usual individual
      differences. There are differences in working-class life situations, too. For example, the lessons are plainer to
      assembly-line workers than to an office secretary who works “with” a boss rather than with fellow workers. We
      will touch on other reasons later.

      To engage in class struggle it is not necessary to “believe in” the class struggle any more than it is necessary
      to believe in Newton in order to fall from an airplane. (In the latter eventuality, however, it is advisable to
      believe in parachutes.) The working class moves toward class struggle insofar as capitalism fails to satisfy its
      economic and social needs and aspirations, not insofar as it is told about struggle by Marxists. There is no
      evidence that workers like to struggle any more than anyone else; the evidence is that capitalism compels and
      accustoms them to do so.

      Not only their leaders but workers as a whole begin by preferring class peace and social tranquility, for
      excellent reasons. But if that ended the matter, it would be impossible to account for the fact of class
      organization. The basic function of class organization is struggle, present or potential, reality or threat. The
      very notion of an organization, like a trade union, which is inherently hospitable to members of one class only,
      and which is inherently weakened until it achieves the organization of the entire class as such, is a notion that
      fits no bourgeois ideology.

      The operative contradiction is between the rights of private property, capitalism’s juridical idol, and the
      organized proletariat’s inevitable <a class="calibre6" id="page_43"></a>insistence on <em class="calibre8" id="ch02--166">social
      responsibility</em> for all vital aspects of life, including the economic. The inherent claim of capitalist
      private-property relations is that the whole area of economic life, in which one has to earn a living, is
      withdrawn from the hegemony of society and handed over to the unilateral power of capital as its birthright. The
      inherent claim of an organized proletariat is that it must have a say in this. This contradiction reflects Marx’s
      proposition that the basic contradiction of capitalism is that between social production and private
      appropriation.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch02--167">
      In the course of working out the contradiction, capitalism accepts many compromises; for example, it yields to
      state intervention in the name of social responsibility, and even demands intervention, especially for subsidies,
      strikebreaking, and so on. But it is in the nature of the organized working class that it can never win enough of
      the substitution of social responsibility for private corporative control; and it is in the nature of capital
      that it always seeks to subordinate partial and distorted forms of social responsibility to the continued reality
      of capital’s claim to social hegemony. This opposition is a basic one.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch02--168">
      There is a spectrum in demands for social responsibility too. More or less radicalized workers may raise demands
      for price and profit controls, regulation, even nationalization; in intense class struggles, sit-in strikers have
      taken over factories without a qualm about the rights of private property. But even conservative workers and
      their unions, taking class collaboration for granted, tend to support social-control proposals which do not
      impress them with having immediate anticapitalist implications: controls over prices, health insurance, offshore
      oil, and many other citadels of property. Capital is usually more class-conscious than that; hence it denounces
      the insistence on social responsibility versus private-property rights as “creeping socialism.” This charge
      reflects a reality.

<div class="indent" id="ch02--169">
      Samuel Gompers used to argue that his simple slogan for the labor movement—“More!”—was more revolutionary than
      the socialist program. The answer need not deny the real revolutionary implications of his slogan, which Gompers
      had no intention of carrying through. “More!” is an implicitly revolutionary program if one obvious condition is
      added: that labor consistently and unremittingly press for it <em class="calibre8" id="ch02--170">regardless of all capitalist
      considerations</em>, that is, even when “more” is incompatible with capitalist needs and interests. Obviously,
      “more” is not revolutionary if it is raised only when it does not incommode capital; Gompers did not confess to
      this limitation, which was his actual <a class="calibre6" id="page_44"></a>regulating principle. His appeal was a class appeal, to
      be sure, therefore inherently discommoding to capital; it need only be applied unremittingly. As labor presses
      for more—including more social responsibility, more control over its conditions of existence—the class drives the
      logic of its own life situation outside the bounds of the capitalist framework and tends to create the conditions
      for exploding that framework.

      None of this happens automatically; hence the complications discussed in many chapters. A potentiality is set up.
      But this potentiality does not obtain equally for other classes and social strata. The working class is not the
      only class or group alienated, at one time or another, by the operations and depredations of capitalism; the
      capitalist class has despoiled middle-class strata, bankrupted petty-bourgeois property owners, embittered an
      intelligentsia, plundered a peasantry, and so on. Radicalized movements and parties based on these social
      resentments have not been rare. But the political programs they tend to adopt as they move into opposition to the
      status quo are likely to remain within the bounds of the capitalist system. Hence they tend to concentrate on
      mere political reform, on economic nostrums like money manipulation, on demagogic attacks on the Bank Octopus or
      Interest Slavery or some other excrescence of the system; they do not tend to come out for abolition of the
      capitalist system. Historically and on a worldwide scale, the latter conclusion is associated with the working
      class, when <em class="calibre8" id="ch02--173">it</em> moves left. This is the content of Engels’ much-compressed aphorism: “who

      This points to the largely unexplored terrain of the social psychology of classes. For we are concerned with this

      For example: one of the best-known stereotypes of timidity is that of the Timid Professor—the Hollywood
      caricature of the pince-nez’d, harrumphing, mousy scholar who blends out of sight among the library books. When
      the individual faculty members of a large American university are examined nowadays, this stereotype hardly seems
      to exist, and maybe it never did. In fact, more and more professors are <a class="calibre6" id="page_45"></a>achieving the
      personalities of vacuum-cleaner salesmen. Yet the organized picture is altogether different. Put these aggressive
      personages together in the collective form of an Academic Senate and the result is a peak of pusillanimity that
      would blow the fuse on a sociological computer, even at times when indignation and resentment at Trustees or
      Regents are sweeping their stout hearts.

<div class="indent" id="ch02--183">
      In many sociological surveys, as has been set forth to the nearest sigma, well-paid workers, who may live in
      $40,000 houses and send their children to college, register answers to questionnaires that stamp them as
      indistinguishable from middle-class mentalities. So also librarians (to take another occupation I know something
      about). Yet striking labor aristocrats—say, printers—can if necessary break company windows, rampage on picket
      lines, beat up scabs, and outrage other forms of gentility, without arousing enough surprise to generate the size
      of headlines reserved for three-person “student riots.” On the other hand, underpaid librarians tend to be uneasy
      about actually accepting a leaflet about the idea of organizing.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch02--184">
      If workers on a picket line have to be restrained from bashing a strikebreaker in an access of indignation, this
      does not necessarily gainsay the fact that their thinking is “middle class” and “respectable” in some sense; but
      obviously they are less constrained by the norms of bourgeois respectability. Their militancy reflects not an
      immediate state of consciousness, but the fact that they are more alienated from bourgeois society than the
      questionnaires show. It reflects an objective class position that may sooner or later tend to mold their behavior
      in class-patterned situations more decisively than do their consciously held social views—especially in the
      context of organization and struggle. In turn, and in time, class-struggle action tends to remold consciousness;
      it reeducates.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch02--185">
      Militancy, taken as a collective and not merely as an individual phenomenon, is in principle an index to the
      degree of alienation characteristic of a social group, corresponding to its life situation—its objective
      relationship to the productive process and to the resulting social hierarchy and pressures. This principle is not
      confined to class questions. Oppressed national or ethnic minorities tend to be more militant than their
      counterparts in the dominant society, likewise because they are more alienated from the “ruling ideas of the
      ruling <a class="calibre6" id="page_46"></a>class” which define the respectable limits of oppositional postures. In the case of
      the proletariat, the roots of this alienation lie in the capitalist mode of production.<a class="calibre6" id="ch02en3-r"></a><a class="nounder1" href="43.html#ch02en3" id="ch02--188">*</a>

      It is quite true that the peasantry and (say) the petty-bourgeoisie are entirely capable of explosions of violent
      rage when driven to desperation; in fact, it is precisely these classes that offer the best, or worst, cases of
      spasms of mindless destructiveness. Few episodes can rival the peasant Jacqueries or the ravages of a
      “petty-bourgeoisie in a frenzy” for brutal ferocity, with or without the instigation of cooler reactionary heads.
      This is the typical paroxysm of blind-alley desperation; it is a confession of impotence, not an assertion of
      strength. There is a great historical difference between bold militancy and going berserk. It was to the former
      that Engels referred when he contrasted the behavior of the still undeveloped working-class forces in the 1848
      revolution with the petty-bourgeois. The workers, he asserted, distinguished themselves from the middle class “in
      showing upon every occasion, that revolutionary boldness and readiness for action, in which any party, headed by
      and composed principally of petty tradesmen, will always be deficient.”<sup class="calibre13" id="ch02--190"><a class="calibre14" id="ch02fn20"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch02fn20-r" id="ch02--192">20</a></sup>

<div class="indent" id="ch02--195">
      Contributing to this claim are the four characteristics of the proletariat already considered. But this point is
      primarily concerned with another factor, which also goes beyond the arithmetic of mere numbers. This is the
      strategic role of the indispensable services performed <a class="calibre6" id="page_47"></a>by the proletariat in keeping society
      going. “Of all the instruments of production, the greatest productive power is the revolutionary class itself,”
      wrote Marx.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch02--197"><a class="calibre14" id="ch02fn21"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch02fn21-r" id="ch02--199">21</a></sup> By the same token, this class is at the levers of economic power not by
      conscious decision but by its objective conditions of existence. The conscious decision concerns its willingness
      to put its hands on the levers; this is indisputably a question of great moment, but it arises because no other
      class has the choice.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch02--200">
      A qualification to this claim is the situation of the technological-scientific employees of a sector of the
      economy, insofar as they are considered to be outside the working classes (untrue for most of them, from Marx’s
      standpoint) or insofar as they are taken as a separate class by themselves (a view even harder to justify). In
      any case, the type of argument that can be made for this stratum and its potentiality only underlines the case
      for the working class as a whole. Experience shows that the whole of society quivers when the working class
      stirs; when a substantial sector of it undertakes a large-scale battle, the authorities react as to civil war;
      and this is true even on terrain far from revolution. It is true in spite of all the theses broadcast about the
      alleged fading away of the working class. So far the periodic announcements that the working class is obsolete,
      having been displaced by technology, automation, and so on, have not been reflected in the realities of social

<div class="indent" id="ch02--203">
      Behind all of the foregoing considerations is a generalized formulation which needs to be stated. It is perhaps
      most closely related to the third point. Marx’s theory asserts that <em class="calibre8" id="ch02--204">only the proletariat</em>,
      <em class="calibre8" id="ch02--205">by the conditions of its existence</em>, <em class="calibre8" id="ch02--206">embodies a social program pointing

      However desperate a peasantry or a petty-bourgeoisie may become, these classes cannot give society a lead in a
      new direction, not simply because of social-psychological constraints, but because there is no social solution
      that effectively corresponds to these classes’ interests while at the same time corresponding to the interests of
      society in general, including the preservation of the social fabric in time of dissolution and crisis. In
      contrast, the working class, as the bottom layer of the class system, cannot stir without objectively pointing to
      a program, even when it consciously rejects it: namely, the assumption of <a class="calibre6" id="page_48"></a>social
      responsibility by a democratically organized people, regardless of private interest—a program which, concretized,
      means the abolition of capitalism.

      In his “Letter to the Labour Parliament” meeting in Manchester in 1854, Marx summarized in a sentence why “the
      working classes of Great Britain, before all others, are competent and called for to act as leaders” in the
      movement to emancipate labor. “Such they are from the conscious clearness of their position, the vast superiority
      of their numbers, the disastrous struggles of their past, and the moral strength of their present.”<sup class="calibre13" id="ch02--210"><a class="calibre14" id="ch02fn22"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch02fn22-r" id="ch02--212">22</a></sup>

      By the same token, these and other characteristics are preconditions for the role of class leadership; as long as
      they are not present, the class is not fit to rule, as we shall see in the next chapter. In this light, it is not
      a question of how the proletariat can be deceived, betrayed, seduced, bought, brainwashed, or manipulated by the
      ruling powers of society, like every other class. The basic point is that it is the proletariat that it is
      crucial to deceive, seduce, and so on.
