<div class="indent" id="notef--5">
      Among the theories invented in Marx’s name—by obliging critics who then handily refute their own creations—few
      are hardier than the myth that Marx had a theory according to which the “middle classes” were doomed to
      “disappear.” We have given an example elsewhere<sup class="calibre13" id="notef--6"><a class="calibre14" id="noteffn1"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#noteffn1-r" id="notef--8">1</a></sup> of the marxological propensity to concoct a “theory” out of
      passing statements by Marx or Engels; and a similar caution applies here. Diligent exegesis of some remark by
      Marx about the middle class does not immediately constitute proof that Marx was propounding a scientific theory
      in making the remark. If this principle of common sense is to be disregarded, I suggest that the next discovery
      heralded by marxology should be the Theory of Revolution by Stupidity, propounded by Marx in 1863.<a class="calibre6" id="noteeen1-r"></a><a class="nounder1" href="43.html#notefen1" id="notef--10">*</a>

<h3 class="h3a" id="noteflev1">1. WHAT MIDDLE CLASS?</h3>
<div class="indent" id="notef--12">
      Marx presented no theory about disappearing middle classes. This was one of the theories conferred on Marx by
      Eduard Bernstein, seeking to replace Marx’s proletarian socialism with a middle-class socialism similar to
      English Fabianism.<sup class="calibre13" id="notef--13"><a class="calibre14" id="noteffn3"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#noteffn3-r" id="notef--15">3</a></sup> For Bernsteinian purposes it was not necessary to be clear about the amorphous
      term <em class="calibre8" id="notef--16">middle class</em> or its fuzzier plural form, since the positive aim was to dislodge
      socialism from its proletarian base. In fact, the protean meaning of <em class="calibre8" id="notef--17">middle class</em>, which
      we have discussed,<sup class="calibre13" id="notef--18"><a class="calibre14" id="noteffn4"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#noteffn4-r" id="notef--20">4</a></sup> was a distinct advantage, since, being a blur already, it could be hocused out
      of or into existence with a minimum of effort. This is not to object in general to any use of class terms with
      ill-defined boundaries; such terms may be as useful as a sweep of the <a class="calibre6" id="page_614"></a>arm to a speaker; but
      a sweep of the arm does not help much with the statement of a scientific theory.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="notef--22">
      Stricter definition is called for when it is alleged that Marx had a theory about the disappearance of a blur.
      What middle class or classes was Marx supposed to have predicted the disappearance of? We have explained that in
      English Marx usually used <em class="calibre8" id="notef--23">middle class</em> to denote the bourgeoisie proper; but obviously
      the bourgeoisie is not the victim of the alleged theory. There are two other possibilities.
    </div>
<div class="indentb" id="notef--24">
      One is the petty-bourgeoisie proper, as defined in <a class="nounder1" href="19.html#ch11" id="notef--25">Chapter
      11</a>. Without question, Marx was confident it was declining, and without question this has come to pass, but we
      shall see he did not predict it would “disappear.” In any case, what he stated was a <em class="calibre8" id="notef--26">tendency.</em> Scientifically speaking, all statements about social “laws” deal with tendencies,
      implicitly or explicitly, and a great deal of nonsense about Marx’s alleged predictions would be avoided if this
      were kept in mind. The following passage from Marx’s <em class="calibre8" id="notef--27">Theories of Surplus Value</em> is pitched
      in terms of two prominent petty-bourgeois elements:
    </div>
<div class="bq" id="notef--28">
      … the handicraftsman or peasant who produces with his own means of production will either gradually be
      transformed into a small capitalist who also exploits the labor of others, or he will suffer the loss of his
      means of production (in the first instance the latter may happen although he remains their <em class="calibre8" id="notef--29">nominal</em> owner, as in the case of mortgages)<a class="calibre6" id="notefen2-r"></a><a class="nounder1" href="43.html#notefen2" id="notef--31">*</a> and be transformed into a wage-laborer. This is the tendency in the
      form of society in which the capitalist mode of production predominates.<sup class="calibre13" id="notef--32"><a class="calibre14" id="noteffn5"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#noteffn5-r" id="notef--34">5</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="indenttb" id="notef--35">
      The foregoing statement by Marx was an evaluation in the course of a scientific analysis. It may be compared with
      one of Marx’s journalistic surveys of the contemporary scene, written in 1859:
    </div>
<div class="bq" id="notef--36">
      °°The ruin of the small middle class during the last eight years is a general fact to be observed all over
      Europe, but nowhere so strikingly as in Germany. Does this phenomenon need any explanation? I answer in one word:
      Look at the millionaires of to-day who were the poor devils of yesterday. For one man of nothing to become a
      millionaire over-night, a thousand $1,000-men must have been turned into beggars during the day. The magic of the
      Stock Exchange will do this sort of thing in the twinkling of an eye, quite apart from the slower methods by
      which modern industry centralizes fortunes.<sup class="calibre13" id="notef--37"><a class="calibre14" id="noteffn6"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#noteffn6-r" id="notef--39">6</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="noindentt" id="notef--40">
      Here the “small middle class” in ruin is clearly the petty-bourgeoisie, shading into the small bourgeoisie.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="notef--41">
<a class="calibre6" id="page_615"></a>However, the decline of the petty-bourgeoisie is generally conceded nowadays. The concocted
      theory of the “disappearance of the middle classes” usually depends on using <em class="calibre8" id="notef--43">middle
      classes</em> to refer holus-bolus to all intermediate class elements in society without other distinction. Marx
      is then reproached with failing to allow for the <em class="calibre8" id="notef--44">replacement</em> of the old and declining
      intermediate class, the petty-bourgeoisie, with newer intermediate elements, which are labeled the “new middle
      class(es).” While there is no question that the old petty-bourgeoisie functioned as a distinct social class, the
      assumption is made that the aggregation of etceteras called the “new middle class” also constitutes such an
      integral class. Still another assumption to be kept in view is the identification of <em class="calibre8" id="notef--45">disappearing</em> with <em class="calibre8" id="notef--46">declining.</em>
</div>
<h3 class="h3a" id="noteflev2">2. HOW TO READ THE <em class="calibre17" id="notef--48">COMMUNIST MANIFESTO</em></h3>
<div class="indent" id="notef--49">
      The myth about the “disappearance of the middle classes” is usually based on selected phrases from the <em class="calibre8" id="notef--50">Communist Manifesto.</em> This is enough to give pause, since it is precisely in matters of basic
      economic theory that the Manifesto is most obviously an immature work of Marx’s. However brilliantly the
      Manifesto fulfilled its task of simplifying many complex ideas and telescoping history into a compendium of
      lapidary formulations, for the sake of a sweeping view of social evolution and political perspectives and a
      maximum impact as a party programmatic statement—all in a few pages—it is not fair to expect it also to take the
      place of <em class="calibre8" id="notef--51">Capital.</em>
</div>
<div class="indent" id="notef--52">
      Still, let us see what is, and what is not, in the Manifesto on this question.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="notef--53">
      It is well known that the Manifesto, striving to spotlight the struggle of the polar classes, enthusiastically
      depicted something like a duel situation: “Society as a whole is more and more splitting up into two great
      hostile camps, into two great classes directly facing each other: bourgeoisie and proletariat.”<sup class="calibre13" id="notef--54"><a class="calibre14" id="noteffn7"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#noteffn7-r" id="notef--56">7</a></sup> This
      clearly puts it as a tendency, a direction of development. So also the glowing description of the triumph of the
      bourgeoisie as it “pushed into the background every class handed down from the Middle Ages.”<sup class="calibre13" id="notef--57"><a class="calibre14" id="noteffn8"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#noteffn8-r" id="notef--59">8</a></sup> When a
      class is pushed into the background, it does not disappear.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="notef--60">
      The Manifesto’s glorification of bourgeois achievement becomes a little stickier when it proclaims that the
      bourgeoisie “has converted the physician, the lawyer, the priest, the poet, the man of science, into its <a class="calibre6" id="page_616"></a>paid wage-laborers.”<sup class="calibre13" id="notef--62"><a class="calibre14" id="noteffn9"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#noteffn9-r" id="notef--64">9</a></sup> <em class="calibre8" id="notef--65">Has</em> converted, mind you!—this is not a prediction.
      This either proves that Marx thought his father (a lawyer), his poet friend Heine, Alexander Humboldt, Adam
      Smith, et al., were all working for proletarian wages—or else it proves we have to read the language of the
      Manifesto with some common sense. This swingeing statement has a point to make, but it hardly intends to proclaim
      a grandiose theory about the Disappearance of the Professional Classes. In fact, the Manifesto is crammed with
      global statements, beginning with “all …,” which no one would support under oath—like the good news for obese
      burghers that “All that is solid melts into air …”
    </div>
<div class="indentb" id="notef--66">
      But the passage that refers specifically to the petty-bourgeoisie is not as far-reaching as the announcement
      about the converted lawyers, priests, poets, et al. Nor is it as expansive as it is sometimes made out to be,
      <em class="calibre8" id="notef--67">if the original text is read, as published in 1848:</em>
</div>
<div class="bqi" id="notef--68">
      The previously existing small intermediate strata [<em class="calibre8" id="notef--69">Mittelstände</em>]—the small industrials,
      merchants and rentiers, the artisans and peasants—all these classes sink down into the proletariat, partly
      because their small capital does not suffice for the carrying on of large-scale industry and succumbs in
      competition with the larger capitalists, partly because their skill is rendered worthless by new methods of
      production. Thus the proletariat is recruited from all classes of the population.<a class="calibre6" id="notefen3-r"></a><a class="nounder1" href="43.html#notefen3" id="notef--71">*</a>
</div>
<div class="indent" id="notef--72">
<a class="calibre6" id="page_617"></a>Thus, through a qualifier, “previously existing”—<em class="calibre8" id="notef--74">which was omitted from
      the English version</em> —this statement makes clear it is referring to the <em class="calibre8" id="notef--75">old</em> class
      structure. And this is exactly what one would expect from the context, which has to do with what has been
      happening up to the present and not with predictions about the future.
    </div>
<div class="indentb" id="notef--76">
      But isn’t there another passage, a couple of pages later, which explicitly predicts that “other classes” will
      “finally disappear”? No, there is not-<em class="calibre8" id="notef--77">not in the original text of the Manifesto as published
      in 1848.</em> The “disappearance” is again shadowed forth by a translation which was worded in 1888 without
      clairvoyant anticipation of what clever exegetes can do. This passage uses much the same language as the one just
      discussed. A translation of the original shows that it too was concerned with tendencies going on in the present,
      and not with predictions of the class structure of the future:
    </div>
<div class="bqi1" id="notef--78">
      Of all the classes that stand face to face with the bourgeoisie nowadays, the proletariat alone is a really
      revolutionary class. The other classes are decaying and being ruined in the face of large-scale industry; the
      proletariat is its most characteristic product.
    </div>
<div class="bqi2" id="notef--79">
      The intermediate strata, the small industrial, the small merchant, the artisan, the peasant, all these fight
      against the bourgeoisie, to safeguard their existence from ruin as intermediate strata. They are therefore not
      revolutionary, but conservative.<a class="calibre6" id="notefen4"></a><a class="nounder1" href="43.html#notefen4-r" id="notef--81">*</a>
</div>
<div class="noindentt" id="notef--82">
<a class="calibre6" id="page_618"></a>Once we remove the changes introduced by the 1888 English version, the meaning is perfectly
      plain: it is a statement about present tendencies. And it is about the same intermediate strata as the previous
      passage.
    </div>
<div class="indentb" id="notef--84">
      But if the intermediate strata are “being ruined,” doesn’t this mean they will eventually “disappear”? This would
      require a separate demonstration; but fortunately a passage in the Manifesto finally does get explicit about the
      coming fate of the petty-bourgeois intermediates and does look into the future. Even the word <em class="calibre8" id="notef--85">disappear</em> occurs. But the mythical theory does not.
    </div>
<div class="bqi" id="notef--86">
      In the countries where modern civilization developed, a new petty-bourgeoisie was formed, which hovers between
      the proletariat and the bourgeoisie and continually renews itself as a supplementary part of bourgeois society.
      The members of this class, however, are being constantly hurled down into the proletariat by the action of
      competition; indeed, with the development of large-scale industry they even see a time approaching when they will
      completely disappear as an independent part of modern society and will be replaced, in commerce, manufacturing
      and agriculture, by labor overseers and stewards [<em class="calibre8" id="notef--87">Domestiken</em>].<a class="calibre6" id="notefen5-r"></a><a class="nounder1" href="43.html#notefen5" id="notef--89">*</a>
</div>
<div class="noindentt" id="notef--90">
      Here we learn that not even the traditional petty-bourgeoisie is actually disappearing. Just the reverse: it
      “continually renews itself.” True, individual members of this class are “constantly” being proletarianized, but
      the class limps on, in a more and more ruined state. Furthermore, some day this class will completely disappear
      <em class="calibre8" id="notef--91">as an independent part of society</em>—which is not identical with simply disappearing like
      the rabbit in a magician’s hat. But while these petty-bourgeois elements (small-property-holding producers) move
      into the background of society as more and more dependent hangers-on of the real bourgeois powers, the Manifesto
      immediately indicates that their places in the foreground are taken by new elements arising out of the needs of
      the bourgeoisie itself. They tend to be replaced, as capital develops, by another kind of intermediate element,
      the various employees of capital hired to superintend <a class="calibre6" id="page_619"></a>the labor process and to serve the new
      needs of the owners of commerce, factory and farm—“labor overseers and stewards.” These elements are certainly
      new in the mass, and they are certainly in the middle of something, and so they are “new middle class” elements
      of a sort.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="notef--93">
      If, then, one looks for Marx’s theory of the disappearing middle classes in the <em class="calibre8" id="notef--94">Communist
      Manifesto</em>, which is supposed to be its natural habitat, it hardly meets the eye. But even if it were much
      clearer in the Manifesto, the conclusion to follow would not be essentially affected.
    </div>
<h3 class="h3a" id="noteflev3">3. STEWARDS AND SALESPEOPLE IN <em class="calibre17" id="notef--96">CAPITAL</em></h3>
<div class="indent" id="notef--97">
      Does the alleged theory, predicting the disappearance of all social strata except genuine proletarians and
      vouched-for capitalists, appear in <em class="calibre8" id="notef--98">Capital</em> or in Marx’s unpublished economic studies
      (<em class="calibre8" id="notef--99">Theories of Surplus Value</em>, or the <em class="calibre8" id="notef--100">Grundrisse</em> notebooks, etc.)?
      This is where it has to be found, if it ever existed. The answer is no. On the contrary, we find <em class="calibre8" id="notef--101">Capital</em> taking note, where necessary, of the new elements whom the Manifesto had called
      overseers of labor and stewards of capital.
    </div>
<div class="indentb" id="notef--102">
      Whereas some latter-day analysts think such components of the productive force are ticketed <em class="calibre8" id="notef--103">middle-class</em> as soon as they are called “salaried employees,” Marx sees them usually as “a
      special kind of wage-laborer.” The capitalist, relieved of actual labor,
    </div>
<div class="bq" id="notef--104">
      hands over the work of direct and constant supervision of the individual workmen, and groups of workmen, to a
      special kind of wage-laborer. An industrial army of workmen, under the command of a capitalist, requires, like a
      real army, officers (managers), and sergeants (foremen, overlookers), who, while the work is being done, command
      in the name of the capitalist. The work of supervision becomes their established and exclusive function.<sup class="calibre13" id="notef--105"><a class="calibre14" id="noteffn15"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#noteffn15-r" id="notef--107">15</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="noindentt" id="notef--108">
      Marx points out that even industrial capitalists get a wage for their labor of superintendence insofar as they
      perform this function. This fact ceases to be a bit of curiosa when this function is separated from the person of
      the capitalist and embodied in hired managers and other stewards of capital. Their wages “assume the form of
      wages for skilled labor” in sufficiently large-scale enterprises. “The capitalist mode of production has brought
      matters to a point where the work of supervision, entirely divorced from the ownership of capital, is always
      readily obtainable. It has, therefore, come to be useless for the capitalist to <a class="calibre6" id="page_620"></a>perform it
      himself.” Cooperative factories prove that the capitalist is redundant, insofar as his function has to do only
      with the social necessities of production. It is the capitalist corporation, the joint-stock company form
      developed out of the credit system, that has “an increasing tendency to separate this work of management as a
      function from the ownership of capital.” Since the stewards perform the real functions, “the capitalist
      disappears as superfluous from the production process.”<sup class="calibre13" id="notef--110"><a class="calibre14" id="noteffn16"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#noteffn16-r" id="notef--112">16</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="indent" id="notef--113">
<em class="calibre8" id="notef--114">The capitalist disappears!</em> But this disappearance is like the other one we encountered,
      when the petty-bourgeoisie disappeared “as an independent part of modern society.” Marx has not magicked the
      capitalist class out of existence; it is advisable to keep an eye on the whole statement.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="notef--115">
      For those who see the “new middle class” as especially prominent in commerce and selling, Marx has a few
      explanations about the role of employees of merchant capital. In general, the salesclerk is “the industrial
      capitalist’s wage-laborer,”<sup class="calibre13" id="notef--116"><a class="calibre14" id="noteffn17"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#noteffn17-r" id="notef--118">17</a></sup> but if the whole commercial operation is removed from the industrial
      capitalist’s sphere and turned over to a commercial capitalist, the salesclerk’s position in the economy is not
      basically changed. The changes, which Marx sets forth in their complexity, do not concern us here. Suffice to say
      that in many respects “a commercial employee is a wage-worker like any other” even though not directly creating
      surplus-value for the employer. “The unpaid labor of these clerks, while it does not create surplus-value,
      enables him [the employer] to appropriate surplus-value, which, in effect, amounts to the same thing with respect
      to his capital.”<sup class="calibre13" id="notef--119"><a class="calibre14" id="noteffn18"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#noteffn18-r" id="notef--121">18</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="indentb" id="notef--122">
      Since commercial capital is simply a part of industrial capital that has been separated out in order to engage
      autonomously in the process of circulation (rather than production), Marx advises us to eliminate this
      complication-for the purpose of seeing the basic relationships—by looking at the office of an industrial
      capitalist who still operates his own circulation process (markets his own goods, etc.). As the scale of
      production increases, commercial operations multiply (“calculation of prices, bookkeeping, managing funds,
      correspondence,” and so on).
    </div>
<div class="bq" id="notef--123">
      The more developed the scale of production, the greater, if not proportionately greater, the commercial
      operations of the industrial capital, and consequently the labor and other costs of circulation involved in
      realizing value and surplus-value. This necessitates the employment of commercial wage-workers who make up the
      actual office staff.<sup class="calibre13" id="notef--124"><a class="calibre14" id="noteffn19"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#noteffn19-r" id="notef--126">19</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="noindenttb" id="notef--127">
      Thus, along with the large scale of production and the expansion of the credit system, the ranks of commercial
      wage-workers tend to increase. <a class="calibre6" id="page_621"></a>Marx repeatedly makes clear that they produce no
      surplus-value directly, that is, they are not directly employed as proletarians (as we have explained
      elsewhere<sup class="calibre13" id="notef--129"><a class="calibre14" id="noteffn20"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#noteffn20-r" id="notef--131">20</a></sup>), but this is precisely one of the cases where the technical line between
      proletarians and other wage-workers becomes minor. Marx emphasizes what unites these two sectors of wage-workers
      even in economic theory:
    </div>
<div class="bqi" id="notef--132">
      The commercial worker produces no surplus-value directly. But the price of his labor is determined by the value
      of his labor-power … The commercial worker, in the strict sense of the term, belongs to the better-paid class of
      wage-workers—to those whose labor is classed as skilled and stands above average labor. Yet the wage tends to
      fall [like that of the others] …<sup class="calibre13" id="notef--133"><a class="calibre14" id="noteffn21"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#noteffn21-r" id="notef--135">21</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="noindentt" id="notef--136">
      Today, when clerical workers and commercial employees are often miserably underpaid as compared with industrial
      labor, the similarities take over even more decisively. Incidentally, Marx’s manuscript at this point left an
      extra two pages for further elaboration on the subject, which he never got back to.<sup class="calibre13" id="notef--137"><a class="calibre14" id="noteffn22"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#noteffn22-r" id="notef--139">22</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="indent" id="notef--140">
      In the second volume of <em class="calibre8" id="notef--141">Capital</em> there is some additional discussion, along the same
      lines, of the “buying and selling agent” of capital: “We shall assume that he is a mere wage-laborer, even one of
      the better-paid, for all the difference it makes.” Functions like bookkeeping also form a necessary “appendage”
      to production, converted “into an independent function of special agents exclusively entrusted with it.”<sup class="calibre13" id="notef--142"><a class="calibre14" id="noteffn23"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#noteffn23-r" id="notef--144">23</a></sup>

      So it is clear that Marx had no problem in seeing the expansion of the new working force required by the
      development of large-scale production, the credit system, and the joint-stock company. Most of this new force
      consisted of new wage-workers, when viewed from the standpoint of basic relations, workers who were moreover
      necessary to the productive process in one way or another. But Marx also had occasion to refer to the growth of
      other intermediate elements. And in the fourth volume of <em class="calibre8" id="notef--147">Capital</em> he even referred to
      these as the “middle classes.”
    </div>
<div class="indentb" id="notef--148">
      Ironically, this occurs as he reproaches Ricardo for forgetting about them:
    </div>
<div class="bq" id="notef--149">
      What he forgets to bring out in relief is the continual growth of the middle classes which stand in the middle
      between workmen <a class="calibre6" id="page_622"></a>on one side and the capitalist and landlord on the other and which to an
      ever-increasing extent are largely °fed° directly out of revenue; which weigh as a burden on the °working° base
      and increase the social security and power of the °upper ten thousand.°<sup class="calibre13" id="notef--151"><a class="calibre14" id="noteffn24"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#noteffn24-r" id="notef--153">24</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="noindentt" id="notef--154">
      These middle-class (intermediate) elements are maintained out of the capitalists’ revenue, rather than out of
      their own small production like the old petty-bourgeoisie. It is Marx who insists here on noting their “continual
      growth,” for he is arguing that the development of machinery and labor productivity does not release the working
      class from “wage-slavery” but reinforces the wage system and the power of the economic rulers. But even so he
      does not claim that he is discovering this as a novelty, as do the present-day discoverers of the “new middle
      classes”; he reproaches Ricardo for “forgetting” them, for failing to put this phenomenon in the foreground.
    </div>
<div class="indentb" id="notef--155">
      Marx makes a similar point a few pages before this passage, also in connection with the consequences of an
      increased accumulation of capital:
    </div>
<div class="bq" id="notef--156">
      The quantity of articles entering into consumption, or-to use Ricardo’s expression—the quantity of articles
      entering into the gross revenue, can be increased without thereby increasing the portion of this quantity which
      is transformed into variable capital [wages]. It [the latter portion] can even decrease. In this case more is
      consumed as revenue by the capitalists, landlords, their °retainers,° the unproductive classes, the state, the
      intermediate classes (people engaged in trade), etc.<sup class="calibre13" id="notef--157"><a class="calibre14" id="noteffn25"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#noteffn25-r" id="notef--159">25</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="noindenttb" id="notef--160">
      These “retainers,” “intermediate classes” (<em class="calibre8" id="notef--161">Zwischenklassen</em>), and so on, are not
      necessarily the same type of elements discussed before, that is, wage-workers necessary to production. So one
      must gather from Marx’s discussion. He continues: Ricardo had wrongly assumed that every accumulation of capital
      means a proportional increase in the demand for labor and in the variable capital (wage bill), because he did not
      understand that “the constant part of the capital grows at a faster rate than the variable.”
    </div>
<div class="bq" id="notef--162">
      However, this does not prevent revenue from continually growing, in value and in quantity. But it is not true
      that consequently a larger part of the total product is laid out in wages in the same proportion. The classes and
      subclasses that do not live directly from labor increase and live better than before, and the number of
      unproductive workers increases as well.<sup class="calibre13" id="notef--163"><a class="calibre14" id="noteffn26"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#noteffn26-r" id="notef--165">26</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="indenttb" id="notef--166">
      Perhaps the most direct contradiction of the myth that Marx predicted <a class="calibre6" id="page_623"></a>the endless increase
      of the proletariat and the disappearance of middle classes is a passage directed against Malthus, in which Marx
      flatly states that what takes place under capitalism is the very opposite of the mythical theory:
    </div>
<div class="bq" id="notef--168">
      His highest hope—which he himself calls more or less utopian—is that the mass of the middle class may grow and
      that the proletariat (the working proletariat) may form a relatively smaller and smaller part of the total
      population (even though it grows absolutely). This is in fact the <em class="calibre8" id="notef--169">course</em> of bourgeois
      society.<sup class="calibre13" id="notef--170"><a class="calibre14" id="noteffn27"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#noteffn27-r" id="notef--172">27</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="noindenttb" id="notef--173">
      The actual course of capitalism, says Marx, is that the “mass of the middle class” grows and the <em class="calibre8" id="notef--174">relative</em> proportion of the proletariat to the total population decreases. Note that here, as
      elsewhere, Marx’s preference is not for statements predicting the future but for statements about the <em class="calibre8" id="notef--175">tendency</em> of the present. The two are not the same thing, of course. Thus, there is not a single
      future tense in the following statement from Marx’s letter to the Labor Parliament that met in Manchester in
      1854:
    </div>
<div class="bqi" id="notef--176">
      °°Of all countries Great Britain has seen developed on the grandest scale the despotism of capital and the
      slavery of labor. In no other country have the intermediate degrees between the millionaire, commanding whole
      industrial armies, and the wage-slave living only from hand to mouth, so radically been swept away from the soil.
      There exist no longer, as in continental countries, large classes of peasants and artizans almost equally
      dependent on their own property and their own labor. A complete divorce of property from labor has been effected
      in Great Britain. In no other country, therefore, has the war between the two classes that constitute modern
      society, assumed so colossal dimensions and features so distinct and palpable.<a class="calibre6" id="notefen6-r"></a><a class="nounder1" href="43.html#notefen6" id="notef--178">*</a>
</div>
<div class="noindentt" id="notef--179">
      One should not conclude from the sweeping language—“<em class="calibre8" id="notef--180">complete</em> divorce of property from
      labor”—that Marx thought there were no more shopkeepers in England than snakes in Ireland; he knew the statistics
      in detail. The preceding sentence had stressed that there no longer existed <em class="calibre8" id="notef--181">large</em>
      classes of rural and urban petty-bourgeois elements of the old small-property-holding type (“almost equally
      dependent on their own property and their own labor”). The most important point to be grasped is this: for Marx,
      the basic characteristic of English bourgeois <a class="calibre6" id="page_624"></a>society that differentiated it from the
      Continent was that the petty-bourgeoisie had disappeared as a class with social weight. Hence his
      conclusion—without niggling qualifications of little concern to the Labor Parliament people—about “the war
      between the two classes that constitute [<em class="calibre8" id="notef--183">in the sense of</em> create] modern society.”
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="notef--184">
      The thought is stated more strictly in a passage, written about a decade later, that went into the third volume
      of <em class="calibre8" id="notef--185">Capital.</em> It is in the unfinished chapter on “Classes,” which no doubt would have had
      more to say on the general subject. Even in the few paragraphs extant, there is a reference which could scarcely
      have been written by one who thought the “middle classes” were disappearing. The class pattern, writes Marx, does
      not appear in pure form even in England, where the economic structure is most highly developed. “Middle and
      transitional stages [of classes, <em class="calibre8" id="notef--186">Übergangsstufen</em>] even here obliterate lines of
      demarcation everywhere,” especially in urban economy.<sup class="calibre13" id="notef--187"><a class="calibre14" id="noteffn30"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#noteffn30-r" id="notef--189">30</a></sup>

<div class="indent" id="notef--190">
      The propensity to quote out of context is worsened when one “knows” in advance that Marx had a theory (about the
      disappearing middle class, for example) and thus merely looks for handy illustrations. The eye may fall on a
      statement like this: “all possessing classes gradually change into capitalists, all oppressed classes into
      proletarians, and thereby the reactionary party fades away by itself.”<sup class="calibre13" id="notef--191"><a class="calibre14" id="noteffn31"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#noteffn31-r" id="notef--193">31</a></sup> Behold, a new
      marxological theory, the Theory of the Disappearance of Reaction. But the context wipes this newborn theory away.
      It is from Engels’ pamphlet <em class="calibre8" id="notef--194">The Prussian Military Question and the German Workers Party</em>,
      which was directed against a recrudescence of feudal socialism in its Lassallean form. The preceding paragraph
      had specified that the Reaction here in question was “the feudal-bureaucratic party,” the prebourgeois ruling
      classes that were indeed fading away; and it was the “possessing classes” of this obsolescent society that were
      being bourgeoisified. In context, the statement was not a generalization about society but a very limited
      statement about the processes actually going on at the time in Germany’s class structure.
    </div>
<h3 class="h3a" id="noteflev5">5. PROLETARIANIZATION</h3>
<div class="indent" id="notef--196">
      In his letter to the Labor Parliament, Marx followed the passage quoted above with a conclusion: “it is precisely
      from these facts that the working classes of Britain, before all others, are competent and called upon to act as
      leaders in the great movement that must finally result in the absolute emancipation of labor.”<sup class="calibre13" id="notef--197"><a class="calibre14" id="noteffn32"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#noteffn32-r" id="notef--199">32</a></sup> If
      the working classes are leaders, they must be leading <em class="calibre8" id="notef--200">other</em> social strata.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="notef--201">
<a class="calibre6" id="page_625"></a>One reason why the alleged “disappearance of the middle classes” was supposed to be so vital
      to Marx was a related myth, according to which the Marxian revolution was to be made by a proletariat that is by
      itself the overwhelming majority of society. But in fact we have already seen in other chapters that for Marx the
      proletarian revolution means a proletarian-led movement, a movement in which the proletariat wins the hegemony of
      the disaffected classes and social strata. Marx’s theory of revolution depends in no way and to no degree on the
      actual disappearance of intermediate elements, but on the fading out of their social weight in the real struggles
      of society, on their subordination as independent class entities.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="notef--203">
      Thus the revolution certainly does not depend on the conversion of every last petty-bourgeois or other
      middle-class element into a proletarian; still, it may be facilitated to an important extent by the
      proletarianization of intermediate strata. Proletarianization is therefore no negligible question. But it has a
      related series of meanings, by virtue of the realities of modern society.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="notef--204">
      If we think of proletarianization in concentric circles (like the schematic social circles of <a class="nounder1" href="9.html#ch02" id="notef--205">Chapter 2</a>), then the core is formed by those elements that are
      proletarianized in the narrow, technical-economic sense, that is, hurled out of petty-bourgeois or other
      middle-class ways of making a living and into proletarian jobs, as when a tailor, teacher, or tavernkeeper ends
      up on a Ford assembly line. Or the tailor, teacher, or tavernkeeper may be forced out of an independent
      livelihood as a self-employed worker and compelled to do tailoring, etc., in a wage-paid job in private
      enterprise, thus becoming a proletarian who uses the same skills as before. Or the conditions of bookkeepers,
      salespersons, other white-collar or commercial employees, and so on—whom Marx once mentioned as typically
      enjoying a better-paid position—may be reduced to that of lower-paid industrial workers, or below; and so their
      status, relationship to the employer, modes of thought, forms of organization, and the like, may tend to
      assimilate to the proletariat’s more and more. This last case obviously uses proletarianization in a much looser
      sense than the first.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="notef--206">
      There are forces operative under latter-day capitalism that tend to homogenize the situation of all wage-workers,
      whether technically proletarians or not; and these homogenizing forces can be examined and evaluated without
      prior determination of what classes are disappearing or fading. After all, sections of the proletariat may take
      on a middle-class mentality for a longer or shorter time without disappearing as a class or tending to do so.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="notef--207">
      Proletarianization as a tendency, in a loose sense, is visible even outside the ranks of wage-earners and
      small-property-holders. To take <a class="calibre6" id="page_626"></a>an extreme example: when the ranks of the medical profession
      begin to consist in the majority not of fee-for-service practitioners (the largest mass of traditional
      petty-bourgeois enterprisers still in existence in many countries and hence a focus of reaction) but of salaried
      medicos working either for a private or a governmental institution, they do not necessarily become proletarians
      and they certainly do not adopt the mentality of factory workers; but they surely start moving in a visible
      direction, as is evidenced by the phenomenon of doctor unionization.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="notef--209">
      Indeed, in many fields, unionization—the adoption of the specifically proletarian form of organization—may be
      viewed as a rough index to proletarianization in the broadest sense, as long as this does not enforce
      hard-and-fast assumptions. In political terms, another concentric circle may perhaps be added on the outer
      periphery if we consider those social strata and elements which are induced by experience to look to the
      organized working class for social leadership, especially in crisis situations.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="notef--210">
      While proletarianization can be given concrete meanings, ranging from socioeconomic to sociopolitical terms, the
      concept of the “new middle class,” in contrast, remains a wraith even for many who claim that this concept alone
      makes Marx obsolete. It is one thing to recognize the existence of increasing numbers of new intermediate
      elements of various sorts, as Marx did; it is another thing to construct out of these elements an organic class
      that is meaningful enough to seriously affect social and political life. This requires a cohesiveness, a fund of
      common interests, an objective basis for solidarity and social unity, such as do not exist among the disparate
      elements of this ectoplasmic class-construct. C. Wright Mills called it an “occupational salad,”<sup class="calibre13" id="notef--211"><a class="calibre14" id="noteffn33"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#noteffn33-r" id="notef--213">33</a></sup> but
      this may be too complimentary, since a good salad needs considerable togetherness; the “new middle class” is more
      like a dish of herring and strawberries.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="notef--214">
      Dahrendorf admits that “there is no word in any modern language to describe this group”—and he suggests no word
      in Latin, Sanskrit, or Old Franconian—“this group that is no group, class that is no class, and stratum that is
      no stratum.”<sup class="calibre13" id="notef--215"><a class="calibre14" id="noteffn34"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#noteffn34-r" id="notef--217">34</a></sup> In short, it is a concept that is no concept. Even Marx failed to predict that
      it would be dreamed up. Somebody should invent a theory about its disappearance.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="notef--218">
      The “new middle classes,” or rather the variety of intermediate elements thrown up by latter-day capitalism, may,
      in part or for a time, share some of the same sociopolitical characteristics as the old petty-bourgeoisie. The
      expression “petty-bourgeois characteristics (mentality, etc.)” becomes a historical or metaphorical description
      of the new in-betweeners, just as the expression “aristocratic airs” may be applied <a class="calibre6" id="page_627"></a>to
      elements that succeeded the aristocracy as ruling class. It would be interesting, to be sure, to make a catalogue
      of similarities and differences, though that is not our task. However, the differences are on a larger scale than
      the similarities. Above all, the new in-betweeners are not bunched together in one life-situation like the old
      petty-bourgeoisie, but are more scattered along an extensive continuum, shading off at one end into the working
      classes proper and at the other into the social penumbra around the bourgeoisie.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="notef--220">
      At the working-class end of this spectrum there is hetereogeneity and fragmentation to be found as in all other
      strata. Clerical workers in large office forces are increasingly amenable to union organization; on the other
      hand, workers in some luxury trades “are strongly attached, without knowing it, to the old rubbish,” as Marx
      mentioned.<sup class="calibre13" id="notef--221"><a class="calibre14" id="noteffn35"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#noteffn35-r" id="notef--223">35</a></sup> The working life-situation has to be examined concretely: for example, luxury
      production is socially dependent on the bourgeoisie through its economic dependence on the amount of
      surplus-value being extracted from the rest of the working class; the reactionary tendencies of a “servant class”
      are well known; and not altogether dissimilar is the position of upper secretarial employees working discretely;
      and so on.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="notef--224">
      One social characteristic of these intermediate elements is atomization. This is what conditions the meaning of
      class polarization in modern society, not the disappearance of all intermediates. As the polar classes tense
      apart, there no longer is a compact class like the old petty-bourgeoisie in the living space between them.
