<div class="indent" id="ch10--2">
      When Marx went to England around the end of August 1849, followed by Engels less than three months later, he was
      of the opinion that the European revolutionary situation that had started in 1848 was not yet closed out; the
      defeats of 1849 had produced a lull, but a new upsurge was around the corner, probably in France. He maintained
      this prognosis for about a year. Around July 1850 his economic studies—as well as the course of events—persuaded
      him that the return of industrial prosperity meant an end to the ongoing continental crisis, and that the
      movement now had to reorient. The task ahead was now preparation—preparing for the next revolutionary crisis,
      rather than planning immediate tactics and their execution.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch10--3">
      A joint article explained this turn in economic analysis and its political consequences in the new London-based
      magazine edited by Marx, the <em class="calibre8" id="ch10--4">Neue Rheinische Zeitung, Politisch-őkonomische Revue</em> (for
      short, <em class="calibre8" id="ch10--5">N.R.Z.-Revue</em> to distinguish it from the Cologne newspaper).<sup class="calibre13" id="ch10--6"><a class="calibre14" id="ch10fn1"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch10fn1-r" id="ch10--8">1</a></sup> Marx concluded: “With this
      general prosperity … there can be no talk of a real revolution,” which is possible only when the productive
      forces again come in collision with the bourgeois forms of production. And he added in italics: “<em class="calibre8" id="ch10--9">A new revolution is possible only in consequence of a new crisis. It is, however, just as certain as
      this crisis</em>.”<sup class="calibre13" id="ch10--10"><a class="calibre14" id="ch10fn2"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch10fn2-r" id="ch10--12">2</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="indent" id="ch10--13">
      This adjustment to the termination of the European crisis was, of course, an important policy decision, and on
      its basis Marx reoriented his practical work and priorities. But the change of prognosis did not itself affect
      his political-theoretical analysis of revolutionary problems. Looking back from 1895, Engels made this point
      sharply in his introduction to a new edition of <em class="calibre8" id="ch10--14">The Class Struggles in France,</em> <a class="calibre6" id="page_251"></a>after mentioning that Marx’s change in estimate took place between <a class="nounder1" href="7.html#part01" id="ch10--16">Parts I</a>—<a class="nounder1" href="24.html#part03" id="ch10--17">III</a> and
      Part IV of that work. He quotes the italicized statement, and adds:
    </div>
<div class="bq" id="ch10--18">
      But that was the only essential change which had to be made. There was absolutely nothing to alter in the
      interpretation of events given in the earlier chapters, or in the causal connections established therein
      …<sup class="calibre13" id="ch10--19"><a class="calibre14" id="ch10fn3"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch10fn3-r" id="ch10--21">3</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="noindentt" id="ch10--22">
      This applies also to the invocation of permanent revolution in <a class="nounder1" href="24.html#part03" id="ch10--23">Part III</a>.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch10--24">
      To be sure, the interval between revolutionary crises was going to be more than a few years, despite the usual
      sanguine expectations. Engels optimistically referred in 1851 to “the probably very short interval of rest which
      is allowed us before the close of the first and the beginning of the second act of the movement,” and Marx signed
      his name to the article containing this statement.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch10--25"><a class="calibre14" id="ch10fn4"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch10fn4-r" id="ch10--27">4</a></sup> And in the following year Engels thought there might be a new
      revolutionary upsurge in France in a matter of months.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch10--28"><a class="calibre14" id="ch10fn5"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch10fn5-r" id="ch10--30">5</a></sup> Through the 1850s Marx expected Bonaparte’s difficulties to
      lead to an explosion.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch10--31"><a class="calibre14" id="ch10fn6"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch10fn6-r" id="ch10--33">6</a></sup> But the theory of permanent revolution, like any thought-out political theory,
      did not depend on the date of an expectation. In fact, experience had shown that it was more important to get
      revolutionary conceptions clear before a revolution than during it, when it might be too late.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch10--34">
      In the immediate post-revolution period, Marx and Engels wrote three important works in which they addressed
      themselves to the overall lessons of the experience they had just gone through. All of them are permeated with
      the third and final view of permanent revolution, whether written before or after the change in prognosis. These
      were, in chronological order:

      introduced by its explanation.

    <br class="calibre18" id="ch10--48"/>
    THE PERMANENT REVOLUTION</h2>
<div class="indent" id="ch10--49">
      Marx’s <em class="calibre8" id="ch10--50">Class Struggles in France</em> stresses above all the hegemony in the revolution of the
      “proletariat round which petty-bourgeois and peasants grouped themselves more and more …”<sup class="calibre13" id="ch10--51"><a class="calibre14" id="ch10fn7"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch10fn7-r" id="ch10--53">7</a></sup> He
      counterposes this proletarian hegemony to the leadership of the petty-bourgeois Democracy-which by now (1850) is
      calling itself by the label Social-Democracy, freely using the amorphous term socialism, and invoking the “Red
      Republic.” In France these elements have been pushed to the left, rhetorically speaking, by the pressure of
      events; but their socialistic rhetoric is for the Greek kalends.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch10--54">
      The course of the revolution, as Marx describes it, presented a pattern of <em class="calibre8" id="ch10--55">polarization.</em>
      On the one hand, the reaction denounced the slightest reform as “socialism.” On the other hand—
    </div>
<div class="bq1" id="ch10--56">
      So swiftly had the march of the revolution ripened conditions that the friends of reform of all shades, the most
      moderate claims of the middle classes, were compelled to group themselves round the banner of the most extreme
      party of revolution, round the <em class="calibre8" id="ch10--57">red flag</em>.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch10--58"><a class="calibre14" id="ch10fn8"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch10fn8-r" id="ch10--60">8</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="noindentt" id="ch10--61">
      Gradually the “peasants, petty-bourgeois, the middle classes in general” had had to line up alongside the
      proletariat, under the blows from their right. Now Marx lays the greatest stress not on the common interests of
      this bloc but on its heterogeneity. It
    </div>
<div class="bq" id="ch10--62">
      is no less a coalition of different interests than the <em class="calibre8" id="ch10--63">Party of Order</em> [the Right]. From
      the smallest reform of the old social disorder to the overthrow of the old social order, from bourgeois
      liberalism to revolutionary terrorism—as far apart as this lie the extremes that form the starting point and the
      finishing point of the party of “Anarchy” [so called by the Right].<sup class="calibre13" id="ch10--64"><a class="calibre14" id="ch10fn9"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch10fn9-r" id="ch10--66">9</a></sup>

<a class="calibre6" id="page_253"></a>All of the very different socialisms professed by these disparate elements purported to aim
      at the “emancipation of the proletariat.” In its own way this testified to the hegemony of the proletariat in the
      bloc, regardless of the sincerity of the professions: “just as in the party of <em class="calibre8" id="ch10--69">Order</em> the
      <em class="calibre8" id="ch10--70">finance aristocracy</em> necessarily took the lead, so in the party of ‘<em class="calibre8" id="ch10--71">Anarchy</em>’ the <em class="calibre8" id="ch10--72">proletariat</em>.” And “the different classes, united in a
      revolutionary league, grouped themselves round the proletariat …”<sup class="calibre13" id="ch10--73"><a class="calibre14" id="ch10fn10"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch10fn10-r" id="ch10--75">10</a></sup> This thought is repeated
      in a dozen ways especially in <a class="nounder1" href="24.html#part03" id="ch10--76">Part III</a> of Marx’s work.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch10--77">
      It is as a part of this analysis that the term <em class="calibre8" id="ch10--78">permanent revolution</em> appears again, linked
      directly to the perspective of the capture of state power by the <em class="calibre8" id="ch10--79">proletariat</em>, not merely
      by the Democratic (or Social-Democratic) bloc.

<div class="indent" id="ch10--80">
      As against the various petty-bourgeois and bourgeois socialisms pullulating on the left, as against all the

<div class="bq" id="ch10--81">

      to the <em class="calibre8" id="ch10--90">abolition of class distinctions generally</em>, to the abolition of all the relations of
      production on which they rest, to the abolition of all the social relations that correspond to these relations of
      production, to the revolutionizing of all the ideas that result from these social relations.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch10--91"><a class="calibre14" id="ch10fn11"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch10fn11-r" id="ch10--93">11</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="indentt" id="ch10--94">
      The “permanence of the revolution” means its ongoing character, its continuation without a halt (even if with
      pauses) until the rule (“class dictatorship”) of the proletariat has been achieved. The rule of the
      petty-bourgeois Democracy may be a phase through which the revolution will pass, but it is not a stage at which
      the revolution will rest. The permanent revolution concept <em class="calibre8" id="ch10--95">counterposes</em> the aim of
      proletarian revolution against any regime under the hegemony of “petty-bourgeois socialism”; the latter, the
      characteristic politics of the Democracy, is incapable of moving outside the framework of the bourgeois social
      order.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch10--96">
      This analysis entails a corresponding change in terminology. Since <a class="calibre6" id="page_254"></a>Marx and Engels no longer
      view the proletariat as the left wing of a movement dominated by a different class force, they no longer use the
      term <em class="calibre8" id="ch10--98">the Democracy</em> to mean a coalition that includes the proletariat: From now on, this
      label is used only for the petty-bourgeois Democratic movement, which lies—or sprawls—between open reaction and
      open social revolution.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch10--99">
      This new usage, we may say parenthetically, was not peculiar to Marx at this time. For example, there was an
      explicit explanation of this change in terminology, regarding the use of the term <em class="calibre8" id="ch10--100">Democracy</em> in France and Germany, in an article series published in the left Chartist paper
      published by Ernest Jones. The articles were titled “The Working Classes in Germany,” by “One of Their Exiled
      Leaders,” the writer being probably one of Marx’s friends in London, perhaps Eccarius. In 1852 Marx referred to
      the use of the term in England, in <em class="calibre8" id="ch10--101">New York Tribune</em> articles. The bourgeois liberals of
      the Manchester school, he wrote, constitute a party which “in other countries, would be called <em class="calibre8" id="ch10--102">democratic</em>.” When the Whig leader Lord John Russell came out as a proponent of the Democracy,
      Marx quoted him at some length and commented: “Thus, then, Democracy is nothing but the claims [demands] of the
      Bourgeoisie …”<sup class="calibre13" id="ch10--103"><a class="calibre14" id="ch10fn12"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch10fn12-r" id="ch10--105">12</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="indent" id="ch10--106">
      For that matter, as we know, the term <em class="calibre8" id="ch10--107">permanent revolution</em> was not confined to
      Marx.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch10--108"><a class="calibre14" id="ch10en2-r"></a><a class="nounder2" href="43.html#ch10en2" id="ch10--110">*</a></sup> But, with or without the term, the concept came frequently from Marx’s pen. While
      writing <em class="calibre8" id="ch10--111">The Class Struggles in France</em>, Marx also did a review of English affairs, which
      presented the following prospect. When the imminent crisis came, the Whigs would fall from power; then—
    </div>
<div class="bq" id="ch10--112">
      A short-lived Tory ministry may follow them at first, but the ground will quake under its feet, all the
      opposition parties will <a class="calibre6" id="page_255"></a>unite against it, the industrialists at their head…. [The Tories]
      will be forced at least to go as far as a parliamentary reform. This means that they will inescapably assume
      political power under conditions that will open the doors of Parliament to the proletariat, place its demands on
      the order of the day in the House of Commons and hurl England into the European revolution.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch10--114"><a class="calibre14" id="ch10fn15"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch10fn15-r" id="ch10--116">15</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="noindentt" id="ch10--117">
      This is the typical concept of a permanent revolution pattern: the ongoing left shift that screws a crisis up to
      the point of explosion. This passage was written in the spring of 1850, hence while Marx was still expecting an
      imminent return to an overt revolutionary situation, but while this fact conditions the time coefficient of
      events, it does not change the concept.
    </div>
<h2 id="ch10lev2">2. TOWARD A “REVOLUTION OF THE MAJORITY”</h2>
<div class="indent" id="ch10--119">
      In adopting the view that the revolution must continue on to the proletarian revolution without bogging down in a
      bourgeois-democratic phase, Marx was not cutting the proletarian left loose from class allies. The need for a
      class alliance is unchanged; but he is reversing the relation of hegemony. It is still true, as much as before,
      that the old regime can be overthrown only by the united strength of the bloc of disaffected classes: “But this
      time the <em class="calibre8" id="ch10--120">proletariat was at the head of the revolutionary league</em>,” writes Marx in <em class="calibre8" id="ch10--121">The Class Struggles</em>.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch10--122"><a class="calibre14" id="ch10fn16"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch10fn16-r" id="ch10--124">16</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="indent" id="ch10--125">
      Marx’s 1850 version of permanent revolution has nothing in common with the Blanquist-type putsch, with which it
      is sometimes coupled by the marxological myth. It has nothing to do with the old dream of a seizure of power by
      an elite conspiratorial minority. Marx’s conception is that, while the “second revolution” must of course be
      supported by a majority of the people, it can be successful only if this revolutionary mass is <em class="calibre8" id="ch10--126">led</em> by the proletarian (Communist) vanguard.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch10--127">
<a class="calibre6" id="page_256"></a>This is what Engels underlined in his introduction to the 1895 republication of Marx’s
      <em class="calibre8" id="ch10--129">Class Struggles in France.</em> Looking back, Engels pointed out that “After the defeats of
      1849 we in no way shared the illusions of the vulgar Democracy” about a speedy victory of the “people.” On the
      contrary, “we looked to a long struggle, after the removal of the ‘tyrants’ [of the Right], among the
      antagonistic elements concealed within this ‘people’ itself.” The perspective was “that the great decisive combat
      had commenced, that it would have to be fought out in a single, long, and vicissitudinous period of revolution,
      but that it could only end in the final victory of the proletariat.”<sup class="calibre13" id="ch10--130"><a class="calibre14" id="ch10fn17"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch10fn17-r" id="ch10--132">17</a></sup> This 1895 statement
      describes the concept of permanent revolution as clearly as anything written in 1850.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch10--133">
      All previous revolutions, continued Engels, have been by “small minorities”: “if we disregard the concrete
      content in each case, the common form of all these revolutions was that they were minority revolutions.” Even
      here, to be sure, there was a permanent revolution pattern:
    </div>
<div class="bq1" id="ch10--134">
      As a rule, after the first great success, the victorious minority divided; one half was satisfied with what had
      been gained, the other wanted to go still further, and put forward new demands … In individual cases these more
      radical demands were actually forced through, but often only for the moment … In reality, however … the
      achievements of the first victory were only safeguarded by the second victory of the more radical party; this
      having been attained, and, with it, what was necessary for the moment, the radicals and their achievements
      vanished once more from the stage.
    </div>
<div class="noindentt" id="ch10--135">
      This, for example, was the permanent revolution pattern of the left currents in the Great French Revolution. Was
      it not also applicable to the proletariat in 1848? True, the workers lacked any consciousness of the
      revolutionary road to be taken—
    </div>
<div class="bq" id="ch10--136">
      And yet the movement was there, instinctive, spontaneous, irrepressible. Was not this just the situation in which
      a revolution had to succeed, led, true, by a minority, but this time not in the interest of the minority, but in
      the veriest interest of the majority?
    </div>
<div class="noindentt" id="ch10--137">
      If in the past minorities could take and hold power with <em class="calibre8" id="ch10--138">false</em> promises to the masses,
      why couldn’t a proletarian-revolutionary minority take power now on the basis of <em class="calibre8" id="ch10--139">really</em>
      satisfying the interests “of the great <a class="calibre6" id="page_257"></a>majority itself”? Finally, and decisively important:
      since the big bourgeoisie held all real power,
    </div>
<div class="bq" id="ch10--141">
      and, on the other hand, had grouped all the other social classes, peasantry as well as petty-bourgeoisie, round
      the proletariat, so that, during and after the common victory, not they but the proletariat grown wise by
      experience had to become the decisive factor—was there not every prospect then of turning the revolution of the
      minority into a revolution of the majority?<sup class="calibre13" id="ch10--142"><a class="calibre14" id="ch10fn18"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch10fn18-r" id="ch10--144">18</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="indentt" id="ch10--145">
      History proved, to be sure, that this prospect was premature in 1848, that the society and the proletariat were
      not yet ripe for socialist revolution, that is, for “a revolution of the majority”; but it is clear what a gulf
      there is between this aspiration to find a way to achieve “a revolution of the majority” and the Blanquist goal
      of the seizure of power by a band of conspirators. In <em class="calibre8" id="ch10--146">The Class Struggles in France</em> Marx
      set forth the clear idea of a majority which is led by a class:
    </div>
<div class="bq" id="ch10--147">
      The French workers could not take a step forward, could not touch a hair of the bourgeois order, until the course
      of the revolution had aroused the mass of the nation, peasants and petty-bourgeois, standing between the
      proletariat and the bourgeoisie, against this order, against the rule of capital, and had forced it to attach
      itself to the proletarians as their protagonists.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch10--148"><a class="calibre14" id="ch10fn19"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch10fn19-r" id="ch10--150">19</a></sup>

<h2 id="ch10lev3">3. THE LESSON FROM GERMANY</h2>
<div class="indent" id="ch10--152">
      While Marx covered France, it was Engels who, in 1851-1852, drafted the historical summary of the revolutionary
      experience in Germany. He has a vivid paragraph summarizing the permanent revolution pattern in a generalized
      form, taking off from the initial unanimity of classes in the March 1848 upheaval:
    </div>
<div class="bq1" id="ch10--153">
      °°But it is the fate of all revolutions that this union of different classes, which in some degree is always the
      necessary condition of any revolution, can not subsist long. No sooner is the victory gained against the common
      enemy, than the victors become divided among themselves into different camps and turn their weapons against each
      other. It is this rapid and passionate development of class antagonism which, in old and complicated social

      said to be one of the principal results of the last years’ convulsions, that wherever the working class is
      concentrated in anything like considerable masses, they are entirely freed from that democratic influence which

      fact, that one of its first tasks is to fight off the imposition of the Democrats’ leadership on the
      revolutionary struggle. The petty-bourgeois Democrats talked big but were aghast at the very idea of really
      taking power; for “in case of victory, were they not sure to be immediately turned out of office and see their

<div class="indent" id="ch10--181">
      Toward the end of March 1850 Marx and Engels drafted a circular letter to the membership of the reorganized
      Communist League, to prepare for the revolutionary upturn which they then still expected imminently. While Marx
      was coevally writing <a class="nounder1" href="24.html#part03" id="ch10--182">Part III</a> of <em class="calibre8" id="ch10--183">The Class Struggles in France</em> as a historical analysis, this circular was written as a concise
      outline of revolutionary strategy in a permanent revolution situation. It was the two men’s most systematic and
      generalized summing up of the lessons of 1848-1849, including what they now considered their mistakes. For this
      reason this circular has been the target of the most persistent efforts by marxologists to discredit it as an
      expression of Marx’s views; Special Note E shows how baseless this campaign is, and also the importance which
      both Marx and Engels ascribed to the document.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch10--184">
      One of the main elements in this “Address [communication, or circular] of the Central Committee to the Communist
      League” is its recognition that the Communist vanguard group in Cologne, organized around the <em class="calibre8" id="ch10--185">N.R.Z.</em> as its political center and under Marx’s leadership, had made a central mistake which
      provides the Address with its leitmotif. This mistake concerned <em class="calibre8" id="ch10--186">independence:</em> the
      inviolable independence of the revolutionary proletarian vanguard in organization and policy, the maintenance of
      the independence of the proletariat—“the only decidedly revolutionary class”<sup class="calibre13" id="ch10--187"><a class="calibre14" id="ch10fn25"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch10fn25-r" id="ch10--189">25</a></sup>—from the bourgeois and
      petty-bourgeois movements.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch10--190">
      At the very beginning we learn that it had been a mistake to shelve the organization of the Communist League, to
      allow the connections of branches and center “to become loose and gradually dormant.”<a class="calibre6" id="ch10en3-r"></a><a class="nounder1" href="43.html#ch10en3" id="ch10--192">*</a>
</div>
<div class="bq" id="ch10--193">
<a class="calibre6" id="page_260"></a>Consequently, while the Democratic party, the party of the petty-bourgeoisie, organized
      itself more and more in Germany, the workers’ party lost its only firm foothold, remained organized at most in
      separate localities for local purposes and in the general movement thus came completely under the domination and
      leadership of the petty-bourgeois Democrats.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch10--195"><a class="calibre14" id="ch10fn27"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch10fn27-r" id="ch10--197">27</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="noindentt" id="ch10--198">
      Note that it is not just the organizational policy that is criticized; a larger political mistake is pointed to.
      The conclusion follows: “An end must be put to this state of affairs, the independence of the workers must be
      restored.” To this end,
    </div>
<div class="bq" id="ch10--199">
      the workers’ party, therefore, must act in the most organized, most unanimous and most independent fashion
      possible if it is not to be exploited and taken in tow again by the bourgeoisie as in 1848.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch10--200"><a class="calibre14" id="ch10fn28"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch10fn28-r" id="ch10--202">28</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="noindentt" id="ch10--203">
      There is reiterated emphasis on the need for complete independence of workers’ organizations in relation to the
      Democratic movement (which, remember, now regularly means the political movement of the pink petty-bourgeoisie,
      not including the proletarian left). There is also emphasis on that independence which comes with the self-arming
      of the workers. And in view of the electoral question that Marx had encountered in January 1849, there is a
      special passage on the question of independent workers’ candidates in elections. Here Marx and Engels recognize
      in very strong words that their policy in the Prussian election had been wrong. The penultimate sentence of the
      Address comes back, for the <em class="calibre8" id="ch10--204">n</em>th time, to the basic importance of “the independent
      organization of the party of the proletariat.”<sup class="calibre13" id="ch10--205"><a class="calibre14" id="ch10fn29"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch10fn29-r" id="ch10--207">29</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="indent" id="ch10--208">
      From first page to last, the refrain of the March Address is: independence—the independent action of the
      proletariat—and no compromising of the total independence of the proletarian movement either organizationally or
      politically; most especially, independence as a precondition for any alliance.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch10--209">
      This theme of independence needs concretizing. Here it is particularly applied to the issue which we have watched
      Marx grapple with over a period of years: the relation of the proletarian Communist movement to the movement of
      the putatively revolutionary bourgeoisie and petty-bourgeoisie, under conditions where the state power is held by
      the common enemy of all three classes, absolutism. The standpoint of the Address is, of course, that of the third
      (final) version of permanent <a class="calibre6" id="page_261"></a>revolution; the revolution is seen as continuing
      uninterruptedly until the proletarian revolution clearly asserts itself as the only possible alternative to a
      return to absolutism. The expectation is that this course will go through a phase in which the petty-bourgeois
      Democracy will temporarily grasp the ascendancy as the revolution shifts leftward.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch10--211">
      The most striking element in the Address is a new realization about this perspective. It concerns the view taken
      of the petty-bourgeois Democracy (now calling itself the Social-Democracy). During the revolution Marx had slowly
      and quite reluctantly come to the conclusion that this Democracy was impotent as a friend of the revolution. Now
      the experience of the period has convinced him of a more far-reaching proposition: when this petty-bourgeois
      Democracy comes to power, it will not merely be a feeble friend—it will be the most dangerous enemy of the social
      revolution.<a class="calibre6" id="ch10en4-r"></a><a class="nounder1" href="43.html#ch10en4" id="ch10--213">*</a>
</div>
<div class="indent" id="ch10--214">
      The Address recalls that in 1848 it was the liberal bourgeoisie that unmade the revolution—
    </div>
<div class="bq1" id="ch10--215">
      And the role, this so treacherous role which the German liberal bourgeois played in 1848 against the people, will
      in the impending revolution be taken over by the Democratic petty-bourgeois, who at present occupy the same
      position in the opposition as the liberal bourgeois before 1848. This party, the Democratic party, which is far
      more dangerous to the workers than the previous liberal one, consists of three elements …
    </div>
<div class="noindentt" id="ch10--216">
      These three elements include “the most advanced sections of the big bourgeoisie” which still want to overthrow
      absolutism, as well as the various (left or right) elements of the petty-bourgeoisie. These coalesced elements,
      which now “call themselves Republicans or Reds, just <a class="calibre6" id="page_262"></a>as the republican petty-bourgeois in
      France now call themselves socialists,” are, in phrases if not in deeds, united against the main body of the
      bourgeoisie-cum-absolutism.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch10--218">
      Marx makes clear that “the petty-bourgeois Democratic party” is petty-bourgeois as defined by its politics, but
      that its class composition is naturally much more heterogeneous, including other social strata that subordinate
      themselves to the petty-bourgeois character of the movement.
    </div>
<div class="bq1" id="ch10--219">
      The petty-bourgeois Democratic party in Germany is very powerful; it comprises not only the great majority of the
      bourgeois inhabitants of the towns, the small people in industry and trade and the guild masters; it numbers
      among its followers also the peasants and the rural proletariat, insofar as the latter has not yet found a
      support in the independent urban proletariat.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch10--220"><a class="calibre14" id="ch10fn31"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch10fn31-r" id="ch10--222">31</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="indentt" id="ch10--223">
      What defines this coalition as petty-bourgeois, scientifically speaking, is the way in which the boundaries of
      its political program coincide with the boundaries of the social interests and outlook of the petty-bourgeoisie
      as a class, its demands being oriented toward “a change in social conditions by means of which existing society
      will be made as tolerable and comfortable as possible for them.”<sup class="calibre13" id="ch10--224"><a class="calibre14" id="ch10fn32"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch10fn32-r" id="ch10--226">32</a></sup> (The specific demands

<div class="indent" id="ch10--228">
      The central question of revolutionary strategy that the Address works out is this: how to prepare the independent
      working-class forces, before as well as during the expected ascendancy of the petty-bourgeois Democracy, for the
      critical showdown with this final enemy of the revolution. The Address sought to spell out a battle plan against
      the expected enemy; or, as Marx wrote a year later, it was “a plan of war against the Democracy.”<sup class="calibre13" id="ch10--229"><a class="calibre14" id="ch10fn33"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch10fn33-r" id="ch10--231">33</a></sup>

      The Address advises:
    </div>
<div class="bq1" id="ch10--233">
      The relation of the revolutionary workers’ party to the petty-bourgeois Democracy is this: it marches together
      with the latter against the camp which it aims at overthrowing [bourgeoisie-cumabsolutism]; it opposes the

      with the achievement, at most, of the above demands, it is our interest and our task to make the revolution

      proletariat has conquered state power, and the association of proletarians, not only in one country but in all

      countries has ceased and that at least the decisive productive forces are concentrated in the hands of the

<h2 id="ch10lev5">5. THE BATTLE PLAN</h2>
<div class="indent" id="ch10--247">
      How should the proletarian camp be prepared <em class="calibre8" id="ch10--248">now,</em> while the petty-bourgeois Democracy is
      still oppressed by the common enemy, to fight the Democracy on the day when it gets the upper hand? Marx’s “plan
      of war” is given in considerable detail for such a concise statement. Its highlights are these.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch10--249">
      1. Today the Democrats present a sweet face of unity to the workers, because they
    </div>
<div class="bq" id="ch10--250">
      strive for the establishment of a large opposition party which will embrace all shades of opinion in the
      Democratic party, that is, they strive to entangle the workers in a party organization in which general
      Social-Democratic phrases predominate, behind which their special interests are concealed and in which the
      particular demands of the proletariat may not be brought forward for the sake of beloved peace.
    </div>
<div class="noindentt" id="ch10--251">
      This type of all-inclusive reform party, as Marx describes it, should not be confused with a party that simply
      permits and encourages “all shades of opinion.” The point of this Democratic-front type of party is that it
      inhibits and chokes off revolutionary views on the left on the <a class="calibre6" id="page_264"></a>traditional ground that these
      are divisive and hence a blow against party unity. It is democratically tolerant only to its right. It has good
      reason for this one-sidedness, since, if the proletarian left did push its own program obstinately, the
      petty-bourgeois and bourgeois leadership and sectors of this party <em class="calibre8" id="ch10--253">would</em> be alienated and
      scared off. Therefore—
    </div>
<div class="bq" id="ch10--254">
      Such a union would turn out solely to their [the Democrats’] advantage and altogether to the disadvantage of the
      proletariat. The proletariat would lose its whole independent, laboriously achieved position and once more sink
      down to being an appendage of official bourgeois democracy. This union must, therefore, be most decisively
      rejected.
    </div>
<div class="noindentt" id="ch10--255">
      Instead, the proletarian vanguard must insist on an independent political movement of the workers, above all
      independent of the Democracy:
    </div>
<div class="bq" id="ch10--256">
      Instead of once again stooping to serve as the applauding chorus of the bourgeois democrats, the workers, and
      above all the [Communist] League, must exert themselves to establish an independent, secret and public
      organization of the workers’ party alongside of the official Democrats and make each section [of the League] the
      central point and nucleus of workers’ societies in which the attitude and interests of the proletariat will be
      discussed independently of bourgeois influences.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch10--257"><a class="calibre14" id="ch10fn36"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch10fn36-r" id="ch10--259">36</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="indentt" id="ch10--260">
      2. Does complete independence from the Democrats exclude collaboration with them? No, such collaboration is in
      order; it means marching together—under separate commands—in a temporary united front of action:
    </div>
<div class="bq" id="ch10--261">
      In the case of a struggle against a common adversary no special union is required. As soon as such an adversary
      has to be fought directly, the interests of both parties, for the moment, coincide, and, as previously, so also
      in the future, this connection, calculated to last only for the moment, will arise of itself.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch10--262"><a class="calibre14" id="ch10fn37"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch10fn37-r" id="ch10--264">37</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="indentt" id="ch10--265">
      3. Then, as soon as the petty-bourgeois Democracy has won the victory (mainly through the self-sacrificing
      courageous fight of the workers), it “will call upon the workers to maintain tranquillity and return to their
      work, will guard against so-called excesses and bar the proletariat from the fruits of victory.” The message of
      the Address is that the Communist vanguard must, on the contrary, press the workers to take the opposite
      direction—not toward winding the revolution down, but raising it to higher levels; must make sure that the masses
      are <a class="calibre6" id="page_265"></a>armed; must press them to leave the compromised and compromising Democrats behind, and
      prepare them for the inevitable counterrevolutionary role that the Democrats will play as their left flank is
      turned.
    </div>
<div class="bq" id="ch10--267">
      In a word, from the first moment of victory, mistrust must be directed no longer against the conquered
      reactionary party, but against the workers’ previous allies, against the party that wishes to exploit the common
      victory for itself alone.
    </div>
<div class="noindentt" id="ch10--268">
      The experience of the revolution had taught that the Democrats needed no manifesto to remind <em class="calibre8" id="ch10--269">them</em> to turn their mistrust “no longer against the conquered reactionary party” but against
      their own “previous allies,” the workers. Marx is emphasizing that the workers should be as clear-headed about
      the realities of class power.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch10--270">
      4. The Democrats will use their ascendancy to try to cut down the workers’ opposition on their left. Therefore:

      Destruction of the influence of the bourgeois democrats upon the workers, immediate independent and armed
      organization of the workers, and the enforcement of conditions as difficult and compromising as possible upon the

      the League must keep in view during and after the impending insurrection.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch10--272"><a class="calibre14" id="ch10fn38"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch10fn38-r" id="ch10--274">38</a></sup>

<div class="indent" id="ch10--284">
      It was primarily on the experience of the 1848-1849 revolutionary period that Marx founded a view that henceforth
      was to be a basic component of his theory of revolution. This was his view of the incapacity of the latter-day
      bourgeoisie to emulate the English of the seventeenth century and the French and American bourgeoisies of the
      eighteenth century by making its own revolution, the bourgeois-democratic revolution against absolutism. This
      conclusion was a precondition for the development of his theory of Bonapartism and the nature of the Bonapartist
      state, and it has already played a part in our discussion of Bonapartism in Volume 1.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch10--285"><a class="calibre14" id="ch10fn40"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch10fn40-r" id="ch10--287">40</a></sup> We have already mentioned

<a class="calibre6" id="page_269"></a>°°Whatever other shapes this social struggle [between capital and labor] may hereafter

      before seen in history: for it must be borne in mind that though temporary defeat may await the working classes,
      great social and economical laws are in operation which must eventually insure their triumph…. Just as the middle
      class inflict blows upon the aristocracy, so will they receive them from the working classes. It is the
      instinctive perception of this fact that already fetters the action of that class against the aristocracy. The
      recent political agitations of the working classes have taught the middle class to hate and fear overt political
      movements. In their cant, “respectable men don’t join them, Sir.” The higher middle classes ape the aristocracy
      in their modes of life, and endeavor to connect themselves with it. The consequence is that the feudalism of
      England will not perish beneath the scarcely perceptible dissolving processes of the middle class; the honor of
      such a victory is reserved for the working classes. When the time shall be ripe for their recognised entry upon
      the stage of political action, there will be within the lists three powerful classes confronting each other—the
      first representing the land; the second, money; the third, labor. And as the second is triumphing over the first,

<div class="indent" id="ch10--368">
      The refusal of the latter-day bourgeoisie to do its bourgeois-democratic duty by overthrowing absolutism could be
      looked on in various ways from the standpoint of the question: <em class="calibre8" id="ch10--369">Does this help or hinder the
      prospect of proletarian revolution?</em>
</div>
<div class="indent" id="ch10--370">
      Implicit in the first reaction of Marx and Engels, during the revolutionary years, was the view that the cowardly
      German bourgeoisie was doing the revolution a disservice, that its failure to act would be a historical
      impediment. This opinion subsequently went through some modifications, but considerations of the problem tend to
      be distorted by conjunctural impressions. In any case, rosier views were possible.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch10--371">
      We have an example of Engels’ effort to look on the bright side of the development, in 1853 as he wrote
      encouragingly to a friend. We see him putting it not in terms of the proletariat taking over the field of
      democratic demands but rather of having those demands taken off its hands:
    </div>
<div class="bq" id="ch10--372">
      All the socialist stupidities that still had to be championed in 1848 as against the pure Democrats and South
      German republicans, Louis Blanc’s nonsense [National Workshops], etc., even things that <em class="calibre8" id="ch10--373">we</em> were compelled to put forward in order to obtain support for our views in the confused German
      situation—all that <a class="calibre6" id="page_271"></a>is now championed by our opponents—Ruge, Heinzen, Kinkel, et al. The
      preliminaries of the proletarian revolution, the measures that prepare the battleground and clear the way for us,
      such as a single and indivisible republic, etc., things that <em class="calibre8" id="ch10--375">we</em> had to champion then
      <em class="calibre8" id="ch10--376">against</em> the people whose natural, normal job it should have been to achieve or, at least,
      to demand them—all that is now taken for granted. The gentlemen [of the petty-bourgeois Democracy] have learned.
      This time we start right off with the Manifesto …<sup class="calibre13" id="ch10--377"><a class="calibre14" id="ch10fn57"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch10fn57-r" id="ch10--379">57</a></sup>

<div class="indentt" id="ch10--380">
      It is true that when the German socialist movement rallied in the next decade, it did start right off with the
      essential content of the Manifesto (or a Lassallean facsimile thereof); to this extent Engels’ ebullience was
      justified. But there is an implication in the letter that turned out to be historically unwarranted. It was not
      true that the proletarian socialist movement was relieved of the task of championing those democratic demands
      that constitute the “preliminaries of the proletarian revolution.” On the contrary, one of the decisive features
      of combined development in Germany was that the socialists had to champion both sets of demands—the completion of
      the bourgeois-democratic revolution and the establishment of a new social order—and the problem of how to combine
      them was going to be fateful for the movement. This historical development offered a great potential for either
      help or hindrance.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch10--381">
      The advantageous side of the pattern impressed itself on Marx and Engels after the 1850s. The permanent
      revolution pattern put an extra thrust behind the proletarian movement, in that it was now pressed forward not
      merely by workers’ needs but by the unfulfilled democratic needs of the whole society. More than ever, the
      proletariat assumed the position of representing the universal interests of society, not merely the narrow
      interests of a particular class. Besides, the pattern seemed to offer the possibility of a short-cut, a way of
      bypassing at least part of the long process of bourgeois political development.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch10--382">
      This thought showed up in the published report of a talk given by Marx to a German workers’ society in London in
      1867. It is the second of the considerations adduced as grounds for hope in the German proletariat: “they did not
      need to pass through a long-drawn-out bourgeois development like the workers of other countries.”<sup class="calibre13" id="ch10--383"><a class="calibre14" id="ch10fn58"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch10fn58-r" id="ch10--385">58</a></sup> Still,
      it is hard to deduce Marx’s line of thought from these few words in a secondhand report. As it happens, a similar
      remark by Engels also <a class="calibre6" id="page_272"></a>comes to us secondhand. On his last New Year’s Eve, as 1894 ended,
      Engels chatted with a Russian visitor, Vera Zasulich, who reported the conversation in a letter to Plekhanov.
      Zasulich paraphrased Engels as follows:
    </div>
<div class="bq" id="ch10--387">
      Fortunately for Germany, the political bourgeois revolution has been so delayed there that an already awakened
      working class was involved in it. That would prevent the German working class from being caught up in a purely
      occupational [economic] struggle like the English and would further its social-political interests. This piece of
      good luck is also in store for Russia: according to what we say, the working class there reads, it is awakening,
      and consequently plays a conscious part in the [movement for] political emancipation.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch10--388"><a class="calibre14" id="ch10fn59"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch10fn59-r" id="ch10--390">59</a></sup>

<div class="indentt" id="ch10--391">
      The question is closely related to the concept of combined development in social history. A broader way of posing
      the issue involves not merely the fact of the German bourgeoisie’s timidity, but the larger picture of the
      consequences of industrial backwardness in Germany. In a letter to Kautsky in 1884, Engels sought to explain why
      the movement was forging ahead in Germany precisely because of the consequences of combined development. First,
      the unexpected fact:
    </div>
<div class="bq1" id="ch10--392">
      Strange. What helps us advance the most is precisely the retarded industrial situation of Germany. In England and
      France the transition to large-scale industry is pretty much completed. The conditions under which the
      proletariat exists have already become stable … The political or directly socialistic movements that arose during
      the period of industrial revolution—immature as they were—have collapsed and have left behind discouragement
      rather than encouragement: bourgeois capitalist development has shown itself stronger than the revolutionary
      counterpressure. For a new revolt against capitalist production a new and more powerful impulse is required, say,
      the dethronement of England from its present dominance in the world market, or a particular revolutionary
      situation in France.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch10--393"><a class="calibre14" id="ch10fn60"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch10fn60-r" id="ch10--395">60</a></sup>

      The consequences for Germany:
    </div>
<div class="bq1" id="ch10--397">
      In contrast, in Germany large-scale industry dates back only to 1848 and is the biggest legacy of that year. The
      industrial revolution is still going on, even under the most unfavorable conditions. Home-industry based on
      small, free, or tenant landholding is still constantly struggling against machinery and steam; the foundering
      <a class="calibre6" id="page_273"></a>small peasant grabs onto home-industry as his final sheet-anchor; but he hardly gets
      industrialized before he is again crushed by steam and machinery…. Along with this goes the direct transformation
      of all conditions of life in the industrial centers through the powerful advance of large-scale industry. Thus
      all Germany—with the possible exception of the Junker-ridden Northeast—is swept into the societal revolution, the
      small peasant is drawn into industry, the most patriarchal of districts are hurled into the movement and thereby
      revolutionized much more basically than England or France. This societal revolution, which results in the end in
      the expropriation of the small peasant and artisan, is being carried out, however, at a time when it happened to
      fall to a German, Marx, to work out in theoretical terms the results of the English and French historical
      development practically and theoretically, to make clear the whole nature of capitalist production and therewith
      its final historical destiny; and moreover to give the German proletariat a program such as its British and
      French predecessors never possessed. More basic revolutionization of society on one hand, greater clarity of mind
      on the other—this is the secret of the irresistible advance of the German workers’ movement.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch10--399"><a class="calibre14" id="ch10fn61"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch10fn61-r" id="ch10--401">61</a></sup>

      The problem may be usefully regarded not as one of determining which pattern was preferable—the advanced English

      Another problem raised by the permanent revolution pattern emerges from an interesting discussion by Engels of
      the French Revolution. Even in this classic case of bourgeois revolution, wrote Engels, the bourgeoisie was
      incapable of making its own revolution under its own steam:
    </div>
<div class="bq1" id="ch10--410">
      … it becomes plain that the bourgeoisie in this case as always was too cowardly to stand up for its own
      interests; that from the <a class="calibre6" id="page_274"></a>[taking of the] Bastille on, the plebs had to do all the work for
      it; that without the plebs’ intervention on July 14 and October 5-6 [1789] till August 10 and September 2 [1792],
      etc., the bourgeoisie would have succumbed to the Ancien Régime every time; that the [European] Coalition in
      alliance with the [French] Court would have crushed the revolution, and that therefore it was only these
      plebeians who carried through the revolution; that this, however, would not have happened if these plebeians
      hadn’t read a meaning into the revolutionary demands of the bourgeoisie they didn’t have, if they hadn’t pushed
      equality and fraternity to extreme conclusions turning the bourgeois meaning of these catchwords on its head,

      In this case, then, the permanent revolution drove outside the bourgeois framework and beyond its historical
      possibilities, but this was not simply a matter of unrealistic revolutionism, as the common philistine outlook
      had it. Rather, this apparently unrealistic extremism was the only way in which, objectively, the realistic
      limits of the bourgeois framework could be attained in fact. The revolution had to pass the bounds of
      practicality in order to reach them; it had to go too far in order to go as far as possible.

      Engels later saw that something like this had happened in 1848–1849 too. We have already quoted his retrospective

<div class="indent" id="ch10--444">
      It should not be supposed that Marx turned a blind eye to the slow advances made by the bourgeoisie in its own
      cowardly way. Alongside the passages cited above are others in which Marx duly acknowledged what was happening,
      if only at a snail’s pace. In England, for example, the coalition ministry was squeezing out concessions to the
      “Manchester school,” that is, to bourgeois liberalism:
    </div>
<div class="bq" id="ch10--445">
      °°What do these concessions prove? That the industrial bourgeoisie, weakly represented as it is in the House, are
      yet the real masters of the situation, and that every Government, whether Whig, Tory, or Coalition, can only keep
      itself in office, and the bourgeoisie out of office, by doing for them their preliminary work. Go through the
      records of British legislation since 1825, and you will find that the bourgeoisie is only resisted politically by
      concession after concession financially. What the Oligarchy fail to comprehend is the simple fact that political
      power is but the offspring of commercial power, and that the class to which they are compelled to yield the
      latter, will necessarily conquer the former also. Louis XIV himself, when legislating through Colbert in the
      interest of the manufacturers, was only preparing the revolution of 1789, when his <em class="calibre8" id="ch10--446">“l’état
      c’est moi”</em> was answered by Sieyès with <em class="calibre8" id="ch10--447">“le tiers état est tout.</em>”
    </div>
<div class="indentt" id="ch10--448">
      The “Manchester men” were satisfied with the financial concessions as the price of their alleged principles.
      “They are in the commercial habit of pocketing the present profits, and of letting principles shift for
      themselves,” wrote Marx mockingly.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch10--449"><a class="calibre14" id="ch10fn69"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch10fn69-r" id="ch10--451">69</a></sup>

      revolution to its end, was incapable of participating in the initiation of a new revolutionary upsurge, though it
      might turn timid in the crunch. In correspondence with Marx in 1851, Engels was glad that even the Cologne
      bourgeoisie’s journalistic voice “now daily sermonizes that <em class="calibre8" id="ch10--453">il faut passer par la mer

      with the vanishing opponent rather than to strengthen the arising enemy, to whom the future belongs, by
      concessions of a more than apparent importance. Therefore, they strive to avoid every forcible collision with the
      aristocracy; but historical necessity and the Tories press them onwards. They cannot avoid fulfilling their

<div class="noindentt" id="ch10--479">
      Up to the last lines, this passage seems to be reiterating Marx’s lack of expectations from the bourgeoisie. The
      final qualification, however, is not inconsistent. “They, cannot avoid fulfilling their mission” has the <a class="calibre6" id="page_278"></a>ring of Marx’s earlier (1847) assurance that one need “not ask what the bourgeoisie merely <em class="calibre8" id="ch10--481">want</em> but rather what they <em class="calibre8" id="ch10--482">must</em> do.”<sup class="calibre13" id="ch10--483"><a class="calibre14" id="ch10fn75"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch10fn75-r" id="ch10--485">75</a></sup> But it is now quite
      different. The difference lies in what the limits of the ineluctable mission are conceived to be, in the 1850s as
      against 1847. The bourgeoisie no longer has the mission of carrying through the Democratic revolution, but Marx
      certainly expects still that its progressive strivings will enter into the process of “historical necessity” by
      which Old England and Old Europe will be battered to pieces. We should remember, for example, Marx’s continued
      expectation that the French bourgeoisie would move to revolt against Bonapartism.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch10--486"><a class="calibre14" id="ch10fn76"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch10fn76-r" id="ch10--488">76</a></sup>

      Marx’s conclusions about the historical incapacity of the bourgeoisie still allow, we see, for the continued

      <em class="calibre8" id="ch10--491">progressive as against</em> the old regime of absolutism and the political remnants of

      To fully understand his position, we must see how it was distinguished from two others that arose in opposition.
      One was the reincarnation of the old profeudal socialism in the Lassallean movement. The other was the
      reincarnation of “petty-bourgeois socialism” in the post-1848 Social Democracy. From the standpoint of Marx’s
      views counterposed to both, these are to be seen as bisymmetric errors.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch10--493">
      On the first: the most detailed explanation of Marx’s views was set forth in 1865 in a popular pamphlet, written
      by Engels and closely checked and amended by Marx, <em class="calibre8" id="ch10--494">The Prussian Military Question and the
      German Workers Party.</em> The first two parts of this booklet dealt with the “military question,” which then
      meant the issue of popular militia versus standing army. Behind this issue of the day was the question of
      political support to the Bismarck regime, whose parliamentary opponent was the liberal bourgeoisie. How should
      the workers’ party line up with regard to this ongoing struggle? This was the subject of the third and last part
      of the booklet.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch10--495">
      Engels’ target here was the politics of Lassalle (who had died only the year before, precipitating a crisis in
      his organization). Lassalleanism <a class="calibre6" id="page_279"></a>took off from a virulent hatred of bourgeois liberalism,
      and oriented toward an alliance with Bismarckian absolutism against their joint enemy. This reactionary position
      was anathema to Marx and Engels, who had been fighting such tendencies in the working-class movement since
      1847.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch10--497"><a class="calibre14" id="ch10fn77"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch10fn77-r" id="ch10--499">77</a></sup> They constantly denounced the Lassallean variant as “Royal Prussian socialism,”
      along with its mentor, the “would-be workers’ dictator” Lassalle. The argument in the 1865 pamphlet goes as
      follows.<a class="calibre6" id="ch10en8-r"></a><a class="nounder1" href="43.html#ch10en8" id="ch10--501">*</a>
</div>
<div class="indent" id="ch10--502">
      In a country like England, where the whole mode of production has been transformed, the proletarian “has directly
      to do only with <em class="calibre8" id="ch10--503">one</em> social class that confronts him as an enemy, that exploits him: with
      the class of capitalists, the bourgeois.” But not so in a country like Germany, where the industrial revolution
      is still in process, where “out of the earlier feudal and postfeudal conditions a lot of social elements have
      remained behind which, so to speak, muddy the social waters.” Here, alongside modern capitalists and workers,
      there are also “the most wonderful antediluvian living fossils wandering about: feudal lords, patrimonial
      tribunals, cabbage-Junkers, cane thrashing … guilds, jurisdictional conflicts,” and so on. And all these fossil
      elements are in league against the bourgeoisie.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch10--504"><a class="calibre14" id="ch10fn78"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch10fn78-r" id="ch10--506">78</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="indent" id="ch10--507">
      As soon as the working class begins to stir, both sides seek its support. “The feudal and bureaucratic
      representatives of the dying society appeal to the workers to strike jointly with them against the bloodsuckers,
      the capitalists, the sole enemies of the workers; the bourgeoisie points out to the workers that they both
      together represent the new social era and therefore in any case have the same interests as against the <em class="calibre8" id="ch10--508">old</em> form of society that is dying.” Since the proletariat’s own aim is “conquest of political
      power through direct universal suffrage” on the road to achieving socialism, “what attitude should the workers’
      party take with regard to the contenders?” Since “neither the feudal-bureaucratic party, which is usually called
      the <em class="calibre8" id="ch10--509">Reaction</em> for short, nor the liberal-radical bourgeois party will grant these demands
      voluntarily,” the proletariat builds its strength by establishing its own independent workers’ party, and asks,
      “From which side can the workers obtain the biggest concessions?”
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch10--510">
      The Reaction stands for “undoing or at least inhibiting modern <a class="calibre6" id="page_280"></a>social development.” But the
      workers do not want to change back “into guildsmen or peasant smallholders, half enserfed or wholly enserfed”
      under the control of the masters and “gracious lords.” Besides, it is impossible to turn back the clock in
      history. Modern machinery, steam power, railways, and so on, “permit no such absurd retrogression; on the
      contrary, they gradually and inexorably destroy all remnants of feudal and. guild conditions and dissolve all the
      little social contradictions handed down from earlier times into the one world-historical contradiction between
      capital and labor.”
    </div>
<div class="bq" id="ch10--512">
      To the same degree that this simplification of the social class contradictions takes place, the power of the
      bourgeoisie grows, but to a much greater extent there grows also the power, the class consciousness, the capacity
      for victory of the proletariat; only through this increase in power of the bourgeoisie does the proletariat
      gradually get to the point of becoming the majority, the preponderant majority, in the state, as it is already in
      England but not at all as yet in Germany, where peasants of all kinds on the countryside and small craftsmen and
      small tradesmen, etc., in the towns still hold it back.
    </div>
<div class="indentt" id="ch10--513">
      Therefore every victory for Reaction’s side inhibits this social development and postpones the day of the
      proletariat’s victory. But every bourgeois victory over the Reaction contributes to the eventual overthrow of the
      bourgeoisie itself, by furthering the building of the workers’ movement. True, the Reaction can make concessions
      to the workers—at the expense of the bourgeoisie, like the English Ten Hours Law—but it will not make <em class="calibre8" id="ch10--514">political</em> concessions, it will “neither extend voting rights nor give freedom of press,
      organization and assembly, nor restrict the power of the bureaucracy.” In any case, these concessions “are
      obtained without any return-favor on the part of the workers” since the Reaction uses them as a thrust against
      the bourgeoisie; hence “the workers owe them no thanks, nor do they ever thank them."<sup class="calibre13" id="ch10--515"><a class="calibre14" id="ch10fn79"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch10fn79-r" id="ch10--517">79</a></sup>

      In contrast, the bourgeoisie and the workers can exercise a really organized political power only through

      decision-making power—in <a class="calibre6" id="page_281"></a>other words, if it can control the pursestrings. But this is
      precisely what Bismarck avowedly wants to prevent. We ask: is it in the interest of the workers that this
      parliament be deprived of all power—this parliament whose doors they themselves hope to force open by winning
      direct universal suffrage and in which they hope one day to form the majority?<sup class="calibre13" id="ch10--522"><a class="calibre14" id="ch10fn80"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch10fn80-r" id="ch10--524">80</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="indentt" id="ch10--525">
      Not that such universal suffrage by itself means political power, as has been shown under French Bonapartism.
      Besides, in Germany two-thirds of the working people are on the land and presently under the power of the
      landowners—hence nothing will change till the rural proletariat is drawn into movement.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch10--526">
      Furthermore, the labor movement under present conditions is only <em class="calibre8" id="ch10--527">tolerated</em> by the
      government. “From the moment when this movement develops the workers into an independent power, when they thereby
      become dangerous to the government, the thing will immediately be put a stop to.” The government will not cut its
      own throat by allowing freedom of the press, organization, and assembly, and without these freedoms “no labor
      movement is possible.”

<div class="bq" id="ch10--528">
      And if it should happen that the Reaction throws some apparent political concessions to the German proletariat,
      then hopefully the German proletariat will answer with the proud words of the old song of Hildebrand: “<em class="calibre8" id="ch10--529">With the spear shall ye take gifts, spearhead pointed against spearhead.</em>”<sup class="calibre13" id="ch10--530"><a class="calibre14" id="ch10fn81"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch10fn81-r" id="ch10--532">81</a></sup>

<div class="indentt" id="ch10--533">
      On the other hand, what can the proletariat expect from the bourgeoisie? The answer is not in terms of
      concessions but of the objective effect of bourgeois victories over the old regime, in “getting rid of the
      rubbish left over from an earlier period.” True, the proletariat has its own score to settle with the bourgeoisie
      later, “but this struggle cannot be fought out till they confront each other alone.” First the “old junk” has to
      be thrown overboard to clear the ship for battle—“only this time the battle will be fought out not between two
      ships but on board the one ship between officers and crewmen.” Meanwhile, in today’s Germany, the objective
      consequences of bourgeois victories over the old ruling class is summarized as follows:
    </div>
<div class="bq1" id="ch10--534">
      The bourgeoisie cannot fight for its political rule, nor express this political rule in a constitution and laws,
      without at the same time putting weapons in the hands of the proletariat…. Consistently, therefore, it must
      demand direct universal suffrage, <a class="calibre6" id="page_282"></a>freedom of the press, organization and assembly, and
      abolition of all discriminatory laws against particular classes of the population. But this is all that the
      proletariat need demand of it. The proletariat cannot demand that the bourgeoisie cease to be a bourgeoisie but
      rather that it carry through its own principles consistently….

      However, this time Engels asks the next question: “But what if the bourgeoisie becomes untrue to itself and
      betrays its own class interests and the principles that flow from them?” Furthermore, this is not merely a
      supposition, for “This case will always come about, since the bourgeoisie, through its lack of political courage,
      will everywhere be untrue to itself from time to time.”
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch10--550">
      Engels’ answer is that the alternative open to the workers’ movement (assuming it does not simply abdicate) is
      “to push the bourgeoisie forward against its own will, and compel it as far as possible to extend the suffrage,
      to unshackle press, organization and assemblies, and <a class="calibre6" id="page_283"></a>thereby set up an arena for the
      proletariat in which it can act freely and organize itself.” But he cannot leave it there, for experience has
      already shown that the bourgeoisie may refuse to be “compelled”:
    </div>
<div class="bq1" id="ch10--552">
      Even in the most extreme case that the bourgeoisie out of fear of the workers crawls away and hides under the
      petticoats of Reaction and appeals for protection from the workers to the power of that element which is its own
      enemy—even in this case the workers’ party will not be behindhand in going ahead with the agitation which has
      been betrayed by the bourgeoisie, for civil liberties, freedom of the press, assembly and organization, in spite
      of the bourgeoisie. Without these freedoms the workers’ party itself cannot act freely; in this struggle it is
      struggling for its own life-element, for the air which it needs to breathe.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch10--553"><a class="calibre14" id="ch10fn85"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch10fn85-r" id="ch10--555">85</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="noindentt" id="ch10--556">
      So it is clear that at bottom the workers’ fight for democratic rights and freedoms is not on behalf of <em class="calibre8" id="ch10--557">bourgeois</em> democracy but is a necessity for workers’ democracy, for workers’ power; it is a fight
      not for bourgeois rights but for workers’ rights.

      “It goes without saying,” adds Engels, that in all this there must be a completely independent workers’ party
      opposing the bourgeoisie, “and in the next revolutionary storm—and these storms now recur as regularly as
      business cycles and equinoctial tempests—it will be ready to act.”<sup class="calibre13" id="ch10--559"><a class="calibre14" id="ch10fn86"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch10fn86-r" id="ch10--561">86</a></sup> Thus the whole strategic

      What now of the bisymmetric opposite of the policy just discussed? Where the Lassalleans looked to an alliance
      with the Bismarckian monarchy against the liberal bourgeoisie, the petty-bourgeois Democracy (Social-Democracy)
      reversed the terms of the alliance. But it did not simply opt for an alliance with, rather than against, the
      liberal bourgeoisie: it aimed to <em class="calibre8" id="ch10--564">subordinate</em> itself and workers’ interests to this
      alliance.

      For the Democracy, bourgeois liberalism was not simply “progressive as against” the old ruling class: it was
      historically progressive in a more basic sense. The Democracy oriented toward becoming a part of <a class="calibre6" id="page_284"></a>the left wing of bourgeois democracy, not simply as a policy in one phase of the revolution but as
      the overall strategy for the whole historical period. At bottom, it represented that wing of bourgeois democracy
      that wanted to “remain true to itself,” that is, true to bourgeois democracy more consistently than the others.
      It was, for example, more insistent in advocating the elimination of the semifeudal “living fossils” in the
      interest of the bourgeoisie itself. As a type of reformism this tendency will come under consideration under that
      head in Volume 3; here we focus on Marx’s view of this approach to bourgeois liberalism.

      In a book published in 1860, <em class="calibre8" id="ch10--568">Herr Vogt</em>, Marx had to rediscuss his views on “the
      relationships among the aristocracy, bourgeoisie and proletariat,” for an ignorant critic had written as if Marx
      merely wanted to “drive the aristocracy from power.” No, was the reply, that would be “the most ordinary
      bourgeois liberalism” and nothing more.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch10--569"><a class="calibre14" id="ch10fn87"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch10fn87-r" id="ch10--571">87</a></sup> And he cited a number of passages from his published writings in which he
      had linked the overthrow of the aristocracy and the bourgeoisie’s accession to power with the historical process
      leading to the overthrow of the bourgeoisie itself. (Unfortunately, not all of his references are accurate, some
      of them apparently being made from memory.)<sup class="calibre13" id="ch10--572"><a class="calibre14" id="ch10fn88"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch10fn88-r" id="ch10--574">88</a></sup> An example—an accurate one—is his citation of a passage from
      <em class="calibre8" id="ch10--575">The Class Struggles in France</em> which begins: “The development of the industrial
      proletariat is, in general, conditioned by the development of the industrial bourgeoisie …” and ends: “Only
      <em class="calibre8" id="ch10--576">its rule</em> [the rule of the bourgeoisie] tears up the material roots of feudal society and
      levels the ground <em class="calibre8" id="ch10--577">on which alone a proletarian revolution is possible.”</em> (Emphasis added
      by Marx in the 1860 book.) After some other citations, Marx adds: “Therefore in countries where the aristocracy
      in the Continental sense … must first be ‘driven out of power,’ there is lacking, in my opinion, the first
      premise of a proletarian revolution, namely, an <em class="calibre8" id="ch10--578">industrial proletariat</em> on a national
      scale.”<sup class="calibre13" id="ch10--579"><a class="calibre14" id="ch10fn89"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch10fn89-r" id="ch10--581">89</a></sup>

<div class="indent" id="ch10--582">
      Let us tie this up with a question we have only touched on up to now:<sup class="calibre13" id="ch10--583"><a class="calibre14" id="ch10fn90"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch10fn90-r" id="ch10--585">90</a></sup> the force of the label
      <em class="calibre8" id="ch10--586">progressive.</em> For Marx this label never achieved the all-sanctifying power it later had in
      some parts of the socialist movement; above all, he did not assume that <em class="calibre8" id="ch10--587">progressive</em> meant
      <em class="calibre8" id="ch10--588">to be supported politically.</em> He could write, “Rent of land is conservative, profit is
      progressive,”<sup class="calibre13" id="ch10--589"><a class="calibre14" id="ch10fn91"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch10fn91-r" id="ch10--591">91</a></sup> without suspecting that this might be thought to imply support of the profit
      system. He wrote elsewhere: under capitalism “anarchy of production, which is the source of so <a class="calibre6" id="page_285"></a>much misery, is at the same time the source of all progress.”<sup class="calibre13" id="ch10--593"><a class="calibre14" id="ch10fn92"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch10fn92-r" id="ch10--595">92</a></sup> This bourgeois “anarchy
      of production” is a motive force of bourgeois progress, no more. It was quite possible for Marx to recognize that
      A is “progressive as against” B <em class="calibre8" id="ch10--596">in some specific context</em>, <em class="calibre8" id="ch10--597">within the
      terms of a given analysis</em>, without equating such a judgment with the programmatic determination that A is
      historically progressive in the basic relations of an era.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch10--598">
      The difference lies not in the magic of the label <em class="calibre8" id="ch10--599">progressive</em> but in the criterion
      underlined by Marx in the above-cited passage from <em class="calibre8" id="ch10--600">Herr Vogt</em>, which in turn lies behind
      the analysis in <em class="calibre8" id="ch10--601">The Prussian Military Question and the Workers Party.</em> The criterion is:
      does the ground <em class="calibre8" id="ch10--602">still</em> have to be leveled “on which alone a proletarian revolution is
      possible”?—in particular, by the production for the first time of “an industrial proletariat on a national
      scale.” Have the socioeconomic conditions already been attained that make proletarian socialism historically
      possible for the first time?
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch10--603">
      In the section of the <em class="calibre8" id="ch10--604">Communist Manifesto</em> beginning “The bourgeoisie, historically, has
      played a most revolutionary part…”<sup class="calibre13" id="ch10--605"><a class="calibre14" id="ch10fn93"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch10fn93-r" id="ch10--607">93</a></sup> capitalism is treated as historically progressive up to this point.
      Bourgeois liberalism, which was traditionally the cutting edge of bourgeois development against absolutist
      restrictions, plays a historically progressive role as long as there is <em class="calibre8" id="ch10--608">still</em> ground that
      needs to be leveled to make proletarian revolution possible. Once this role has been accomplished, once the
      social conditions are in existence for the proletariat’s own bid for power, the progressiveness of the bourgeois
      movement in this large-scale sense must be considered in a basically altered context. (To be sure, there may
      always be progressive <em class="calibre8" id="ch10--609">elements</em> in certain relationships, as subordinate and far from
      decisive considerations, especially where these subordinate elements are “progressive as against…”)
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch10--610">
      But even where a formation or relationship is indubitably progressive from Marx’s standpoint, this fact did not
      mechanically determine his political support. Political support is a choosing of sides in a class struggle;
      whether it is accorded or not involves much more than the label of progressiveness. We have already seen an
      example of this in the attitude of Marx and Engels toward “progressive despots” like Napoleon.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch10--611"><a class="calibre14" id="ch10fn94"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch10fn94-r" id="ch10--613">94</a></sup> Let us
      take a more elementary example.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch10--614">
      Marx’s formulation in <em class="calibre8" id="ch10--615">Herr Vogt</em> must recall the process that Marx describes indignantly
      in <em class="calibre8" id="ch10--616">Capital</em>, on the primitive accumulation of capital. This so progressive capital comes
      into the world “dripping from <a class="calibre6" id="page_286"></a>head to foot, from every pore, with blood and dirt,” its birth
      “heralded by a great slaughter of the innocents,” feeding on “the capitalized blood of children,” recruiting its
      forces “by undisguised looting, enslavement, and murder”—and so on.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch10--618"><a class="calibre14" id="ch10fn95"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch10fn95-r" id="ch10--620">95</a></sup> All this—including the
      driving of the peasantry off the land by the enclosures movement and the superexploitation of the new
      proletarians in the warrens of the Industrial Revolution—“tears up the material roots of feudal society and
      levels the ground on which alone a proletarian revolution is possible,” producing “an industrial proletariat on a
      national scale,” and other preconditions. This development is therefore progressive—an indisputably historical
      manifestation of the progressive role of capitalism. What follows politically?
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch10--621">
      This objective historical fact was of great importance for Marx, especially in evaluating antibourgeois trends
      that looked backward to outlived conditions. But, to put it mildly, this consideration did not lead him to give
      political support to the governments and leaders and ideologists at the head of this historically progressive
      movement. On the contrary, he advocated the building of a proletarian movement to fight against these
      “progressive” leaders. It was the petty-bourgeois Democracy, which he cordially despised, that implicitly or
      explicitly followed the policy, “This bourgeoisie is historically progressive, <em class="calibre8" id="ch10--622">therefore</em>
      our political role is to form the left wing of this progressive movement.”
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch10--623">
      The grim era of the accumulation of capital and the Industrial Revolution was the best that could be done by the
      capitalist system, which is inherently destructive of human values, even when it was historically progressive as
      against the old society it was rooting out. <em class="calibre8" id="ch10--624">But it was not progressive as against the class
      struggle of the workers it exploited.</em> The bourgeois development was progressive insofar as it cleared the
      ground of precapitalist encumbrances to the proletarian revolution; but the process of proletarian revolution
      does not begin with revolution. It begins with the elementary class struggle against this same progressive
      bourgeoisie—a class struggle that begins not on the day when all the ground has already been cleared but long
      before then, indeed with the first breath of the new working class.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch10--625">
      In short: since bourgeois development is progressive only insofar as it clears the ground for the development of
      the proletarian class struggle, it can never be progressive as against the proletarian class struggle itself.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch10--626">
      This question sometimes merges with another one, on the basis of a <a class="calibre6" id="page_287"></a>standpoint equally alien
      to Marx’s thinking. This is the view that the movement for proletarian revolution should not begin until there is
      a present possibility of victory, before which time it is “utopian” and “unrealistic.” Since the movement for
      proletarian revolution begins with the elementary class struggle, this viewpoint means that the class struggle is
      to be discouraged—in reality, repressed—until some suitable late date. Among the many assumptions of this
      standpoint is the belief that the class struggle can be turned on and off by some manipulationist leadership.
      From Marx’s view, this is a typical reflection of ruling-class ideology, which habitually views slaves as tools;
      and this would be clear even if the Manifesto had not remarked of the proletariat that “With its birth begins its
      struggle with the bourgeoisie.”<sup class="calibre13" id="ch10--628"><a class="calibre14" id="ch10fn96"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch10fn96-r" id="ch10--630">96</a></sup> In any case, there is no way of determining when the historical possibility of
      victory has arrived in this sense: <em class="calibre8" id="ch10--631">on s’engage et puis on verra.</em> Anyone could see that
      proletarian revolution was premature in 1848, if one waits a half century; and when Engels wrote this opinion
      down in 1895<sup class="calibre13" id="ch10--632"><a class="calibre14" id="ch10fn97"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch10fn97-r" id="ch10--634">97</a></sup> he was not under the impression it was a great revelation. This 20-20 hindsight
      was for some—not Engels—a condemnation of the Forty-eighters for failing to possess a crystal ball.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch10--635">
      The most important consideration is this: for a class to begin its class struggle, on cue, only when the
      proletarian revolution is stamped <em class="calibre8" id="ch10--636">possible—even</em> if this elitist fantasy were possible—is
      to ensure that the possibility will not turn into reality for a very long time. Unless class struggle develops
      long before this point, a revolutionary class cannot organize in any way, let alone in the advanced political
      forms necessary for victory; and this is a long process. Without class struggle, a revolutionary class cannot
      develop its own leadership and experienced cadres. Without class struggle, the class cannot attain the political
      and ideological level necessary to aspire to victory in revolution, let alone gain the victory.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch10--637">
      The revolutionary class struggle—considered in 20-20 hindsight—begins with the historical certainty of defeats,
      at best of mixed defeats and partial victories. “Now and then the workers are victorious, but only for a time.
      The real fruit of their battles lies, not in the immediate result, but in the ever-expanding union of the
      workers.”<sup class="calibre13" id="ch10--638"><a class="calibre14" id="ch10fn98"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_000.html#ch10fn98-r" id="ch10--640">98</a></sup> It is only through defeats that a revolutionary class gains the experience to
      build an effective movement and learns how to be successful. The history of every class aspiring to political
      power is necessarily a history of educational defeats crowned by only one lasting victory.
