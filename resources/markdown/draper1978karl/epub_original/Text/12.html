    <div class="indent" id="ch05--2">
      While it became common to speak of the trade unions as the <em id="ch05--3" class="calibre8">elementary</em> organization of class
      struggle, this did not mean that its struggle had to remain on a primitive and rock-bottom level of
      consciousness. On the contrary, Marx emphasized the need to urge the trade unions on to higher levels of activity
      and struggle, in a line of progress culminating in commitment to independent political action. A socialist
      trade-unionist who considered himself advanced beyond bread-and-butter unionism had internal responsibilities;
      political revolutionists outside the union structure had proposals to urge. In any case, Marx had definite ideas
      on what made a trade union better or worse, effective or weak, from the standpoint of its basic class role.

    <h3 class="h2" id="ch05lev1">1. PROGRESSIVE UNIONISM</h3>

    <div class="indent" id="ch05--5">
      These proposals for effective trade-unionism can be summarized from the material in the preceding chapter, for
      they all stem from Marx’s view of the relationship between trade unions as an organizational form and the
      proletariat as a potentially revolutionary class. We list five main points.

      1. <em id="ch05--7" class="calibre8">Class-struggle policy and militancy</em>. In one of his popular articles for trade-unionists
      in 1881, Engels wrote:
    </div>

    <div class="bqi" id="ch05--8">
      The struggle of the labourer against capital, we said. That struggle does exist, whatever the apologists of
      capital may say to the contrary. It will exist so long as a reduction of wages remains the safest and readiest
      means of raising profits; nay, so long as the wages system itself shall exist. The very existence of Trades
      <a id="page_116" class="calibre6"></a>Unions is proof sufficient of the fact; if they are not made to fight against the
      encroachments of capital, what are they made for? There is no use in mincing matters. No milksop words can hide
      the ugly fact that present society is mainly divided into two great antagonistic classes …<sup id="ch05--10" class="calibre13"><a id="ch05fn1" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch05--12" href="39_split_000.html#ch05fn1-r">1</a></sup>
    </div>

    <div class="noindent" id="ch05--13">
      The objective role of trade unions in the class struggle is one thing; the conscious policy of a given union
      leadership is another. We will be concerned here not with the problems of generalship, but only with the
      conceptions held by the leadership and membership.
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="ch05--14">
      A class-struggle policy by a union does not mean one consciously embracing a revolutionary goal or ideology
      (whatever that may be taken to mean) or one that adopts a socialist program, whether or not the union is in fact
      led by socialists. A class-struggle policy may be defined as one that defends the interests of the workers as
      such, against the employers as such, regardless of the consequences of this struggle for the capitalists, for
      their system, or for the government, without drawing back out of consideration for any interests other than those
      of the embattled class.
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="ch05--15">
      A great number of class struggles, even large-scale strikes, have been fought by workers and directed by leaders
      who held nothing but immediate bread-and-butter aims, yet maintained consistent loyalty to class interests in the
      face of considerable pressure. They may even have held views approving of the capitalist system and rejecting
      socialism; this bespeaks their level of consciousness; but what matters is whether these views were subordinated
      to the needs of the class struggle, or whether they came to supersede the latter.
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="ch05--16">
      Contrariwise, a class-collaboration policy takes the widely heralded “harmony of interests of labor and capital”
      not simply as a consciously held opinion or wish but as the <em id="ch05--17" class="calibre8">determinant</em> of trade-union
      policy in action. The crux is, again, not whether specific trade-unionists “believe in” this harmony, any more
      than whether they believe in capitalism; the crux is whether in fact they derive trade-union policy from these
      ideas, instead of from their response to the felt needs of their class. Thus a trade-unionist may be altogether
      nonrevolutionary in subjective opinion, yet capable of following a class-struggle policy in action. Indeed, a
      worker who is advancing in class-consciousness normally goes through such a transitional phase. The worker’s
      version of a “belief in” capitalism contains vital elements that are operationally hostile to the <em id="ch05--18" class="calibre8">capitalist’s</em> version of a belief in capitalism. The difference between <a id="page_117" class="calibre6"></a>these
      two modes of procapitalism is itself a reflection of the class-struggle reality, and it is brought to the
      surface, to consciousness, in the course of struggle. In this sense, a class-struggle policy tends to produce a
      socialist consciousness, through experience, even though it does not start with it.
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="ch05--20">
      So much for generalization. In practice, an activist translation of a theoretical statement about class-struggle
      policy may appear as <em id="ch05--21" class="calibre8">militancy.</em>
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="ch05--22">
      More concrete discussion of trade-union policies is outside our purview, but it may be useful to point to some
      specific cases in which Engels reacted to special problems of class-struggle policy. We cite Engels, rather than
      Marx, because it was he who lived on into the period when problems of socialist policy in trade unions began to
      loom large.
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="ch05--23">
      In 1891 twenty thousand Ruhr miners exploded in a strike for higher wages and eight-hour shifts. The government
      broke the strike with soldiery, but the fight marked a stage in the organization and radicalization of the
      miners. The German Social-Democratic leadership had believed the moment unfavorable for battle and had warned the
      miners against premature action—probably correctly. The party leaders also feared that the government wanted an
      outbreak that could be put down by force and turned to political capital against the socialists—again probably
      correctly. There was an acute problem of generalship involved. Yet the way in which the party press dealt with
      the strike provoked one of the few occasions when Engels intervened on a matter of internal policy. He wrote to
      both Bebel and Kautsky with obvious disquiet.
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="ch05--24">
      Engels did not question that it would have been wiser tactics for the miners to have held back. But how should
      socialists react when the proletariat goes into battle against their better judgment? He wrote first to Kautsky:
    </div>

    <div class="bq" id="ch05--25">
      Our people in Berlin [party leaders] see everything only from <em id="ch05--26" class="calibre8">their</em> standpoint. So too
      they often forget that they cannot assume the miners have the kind of discipline that was drilled into the
      <em id="ch05--27" class="calibre8">old</em> soldiers of the party by the Anti-Socialist Law; and that <em id="ch05--28" class="calibre8">every</em>
      new group of workers <em id="ch05--29" class="calibre8">will be driven toward us</em> in the course of unwise, necessarily
      unsuccessful but, under the circumstances, inevitable strikes of angry passion … One cannot have only the
      pleasant sides of the movement, one must also accept the momentarily <a id="page_118" class="calibre6"></a>disagreeable things.
      Besides, the rigid discipline of a <em id="ch05--31" class="calibre8">sect</em> cannot continue to exist in a <em id="ch05--32" class="calibre8">big party</em>, and that also has its good side.<sup id="ch05--33" class="calibre13"><a id="ch05fn2" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch05--35" href="39_split_000.html#ch05fn2-r">2</a></sup>

    <div class="noindent" id="ch05--36">
      To Bebel:
    </div>

    <div class="bq" id="ch05--37">
      The ill-advised strike of angry passion is, as matters stand, the usual way that large new strata of workers are
      brought in our direction. <em id="ch05--38" class="calibre8">These</em> facts seem to me to have been given too little
      consideration in the treatment by <em id="ch05--39" class="calibre8">Vorwärts.</em> Liebknecht [its editor] knows no shadings, he
      is either all black or all white; and if he thought he was duty-bound to prove to the world that our party did
      not egg on this strike, and even calmed it down, then God have mercy on the poor strikers—for them less than a
      desirable amount of concern has been shown, to see that they come to us soon.<sup id="ch05--40" class="calibre13"><a id="ch05fn3" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch05--42" href="39_split_000.html#ch05fn3-r">3</a></sup>

    <div class="indent" id="ch05--43">
      The underlying issue was loyalty to the class movement, regardless of the immediate consequences for the narrower
      interests of the party.
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="ch05--44">
      If the German leadership was perturbed when the class struggle did not flow through party channels in a properly
      disciplined way, the problem with the French movement was just the opposite. There the trade unions remained weak
      and impotent; there was not enough proletarian discipline to win a strike or build an organization even under
      favorable conditions; it was much easier to indulge in the favorite game of “r-r-revolutionary” windbagging.
      Writing to his Paris contact (Marx’s daughter Laura), Engels advised, apropos of a situation in 1886:
    </div>

    <div class="bq" id="ch05--45">
      … strike discipline is very useful for the French workers; the first condition for the success of such a struggle
      is scrupulous regard for legality, and all revolutionary bragging and outbursts of passion lead inevitably to
      defeat. This discipline, which is the first condition for a successful and firm organization, is what the
      bourgeoisie fears most.<sup id="ch05--46" class="calibre13"><a id="ch05fn4" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch05--48" href="39_split_000.html#ch05fn4-r">4</a></sup>
    </div>

    <div class="noindent" id="ch05--49">
      The immediate trade-union objective in France, Engels explained, was to force the government to treat strikes as
      <em id="ch05--50" class="calibre8">legal</em> acts. Where in Germany the party leadership had an overbureaucratic conception of
      how to react to spontaneous militancy, in France the leaders still had to learn that the workers’ movement does
      not live by spontaneous spasms alone.
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="ch05--51">
      “Scrupulous regard for legality”—so Engels had cautioned the French in this juncture, as a matter of generalship.
      The relativity of <a id="page_119" class="calibre6"></a>militancy will be illuminated from another direction if we turn to a
      problem involving the most law-abiding people on earth, the English. After a tense confrontation in London, Marx
      reported to Engels:
    </div>

    <div class="bqi" id="ch05--53">
      Here the government has nearly produced a revolt. The Englishman first needs a revolutionary education, of
      course, and two weeks would be enough for that if [Police Commissioner] Sir Richard Mayne had absolute control….
      One thing is certain, these thick-headed John Bulls, whose brainpans seem to have been specially manufactured for
      the constables’ bludgeons, will never get anywhere without a really bloody encounter with the ruling
      powers.<sup id="ch05--54" class="calibre13"><a id="ch05fn5" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch05--56" href="39_split_000.html#ch05fn5-r">5</a></sup>
    </div>

    <div class="noindent" id="ch05--57">
      Marx had reacted similarly when the <em id="ch05--58" class="calibre8">Sunday Times</em> once admonished the strike movement that
      “The demands of the working people may be submitted to when urged in a respectful manner.” He retorted in an
      article:
    </div>

    <div class="bq" id="ch05--59">
      °°Has any one ever heard of the price of coffee rising at Mincing Lane when “urged in a <em id="ch05--60" class="calibre8">respectful</em> manner!” The trade in human flesh and blood, being carried on in the same manner as
      that of any other commodity, give it at least the chances of any other.<sup id="ch05--61" class="calibre13"><a id="ch05fn6" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch05--63" href="39_split_000.html#ch05fn6-r">6</a></sup>

      taking the narrow view of the sect, with its “rigid discipline,” instead of the attitude of a class party. A sect
      counterposed its special views (which might be very good in themselves) to the interests of class development as
      a whole. What seemed like a momentary failing of the German party was, however, the systematic character of other
      groups: in particular, the “Marxist” group in England (repudiated by Marx) called the Social Democratic
      Federation and led by H. M. Hyndman, as well as another group called the Socialist League, associated with
      William Morris.
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="ch05--68">
      The silly standoffishness of these two repositories of an alleged revolutionary socialism was a continual
      affliction to Engels especially as the explosive development of the “New Unionism” opened up new possibilities
      for socialism. The case was similar with the American group, the Socialist Labor Party. Writing to an American
      correspondent, <a id="page_120" class="calibre6"></a>Engels expressed his hope that the S.L.P. would kindly liquidate itself in
      the interest of socialist progress, and turned to the English example:
    </div>

    <div class="bqi" id="ch05--70">
      Over here it is being proved that a great nation simply cannot be tutored in a doctrinaire and dogmatic fashion,
      even if one has the best of theories … The movement <em id="ch05--71" class="calibre8">is</em> under way now at last and, I
      believe, for good. But not directly socialist, and those among the English who have understood our theory best
      remain outside it: Hyndman because he is incurably jealous and intriguing, [E. Belfort] Bax because he is a
      bookworm.<sup id="ch05--72" class="calibre13"><a id="ch05fn7" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch05--74" href="39_split_000.html#ch05fn7-r">7</a></sup>
    </div>

    <div class="noindent" id="ch05--75">
      These personal characterizations were justified, but not sufficient to explain the self-defeating policies of the
      sectists. Experience showed that what was involved was a conceptualized dogma about the relationship between the
      enlightened elite of the vanguard and the benighted body of the class. In a letter a few months later, Engels
      generalized a little more, but still focused on style of operation. He raged at the bad attitude of
    </div>

    <div class="bq" id="ch05--76">
      the Socialist League, which looks down on everything that is not directly revolutionary (which means here in
      England as in your country: all who do not limit themselves to making phrases and otherwise doing nothing), and
      the [Social Democratic] Federation, which still behaves as if all except themselves were asses and bunglers,
      although it is precisely owing to the new impetus lent to the movement that <em id="ch05--77" class="calibre8">they</em> have
      succeeded in getting some following again.<sup id="ch05--78" class="calibre13"><a id="ch05fn8" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch05--80" href="39_split_000.html#ch05fn8-r">8</a></sup>
    </div>

    <div class="noindent" id="ch05--81">
      Indeed, some of the best organizers of the new unions began as S.D.F. members but had to break with the sect in
      order to do effective work as trade-union militants. Engels generally supported such organizers against the sect.
      In a published interview he repudiated the S.D.F. on the ground of its sectism, and gave an example:
    </div>

    <div class="bq" id="ch05--82">
      It is an exclusive body. It has not understood how to take the lead of the working-class movement generally, and
      to direct it towards socialism. It has turned Marxism into an orthodoxy. Thus it insisted upon [dockers’ leader]
      Johns Burns unfurling the red flag at the dock strike, where such an act would have ruined the whole movement,
      and, instead of gaining over the dockers, would have driven them back into the arms of the capitalists.<sup id="ch05--83" class="calibre13"><a id="ch05fn9" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch05--85" href="39_split_000.html#ch05fn9-r">9</a></sup>
    </div>

    <div class="noindent" id="ch05--86">
      The sectism of the Hyndman group, like its similars, suggested a <a id="page_121" class="calibre6"></a>fossilized sort of
      ultimatism, as if it were saying to the class it purported to represent: Either you obey my certified-correct
      Revolutionary Program, or else I will punish you by withdrawing my benediction on your existence and will refuse
      to be contaminated by further association with your unsanctified activities. Marx implemented a basically
      different conception of the relation of socialists to trade unions. Socialists should act as a loyal left wing of
      the class movement, not an alternative counterposed to it; they should start with the working class as it is and
      where it is, in order to change it; they should be a part of its real class organizations no matter how backward
      the mass might be from their standpoint; and they should become the best militants for the limited aims of the
      movement-as-is. But at the same time, and through this association, they seek to push the whole movement upward
      to higher levels of class-struggle commitment and consciousness by means of the lessons of experience, all
      without giving up or hushing their own full views or ceasing to criticize mistaken and ineffective policies.
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="ch05--88">
      We have just paraphrased the <em id="ch05--89" class="calibre8">Communist Manifesto</em>, whose words apply fully to the
      trade-union arm of the proletariat: “In the various stages of development which the struggle of the working class
      has to pass through, they [the Communists] always and everywhere represent the interests of the movement as a
      whole”; and “The Communists fight for the attainment of the immediate aims, for the enforcement of the momentary
      interests of the working class; but in the movement of the present, they also represent and take care of the
      future of that movement.” It is in this sense that the Manifesto explains that “The Communists do not form a
      separate party opposed to other working-class parties [<em id="ch05--90" class="calibre8">read:</em> other arms of the working
      class],” that “They have no interests separate and apart from those of the proletariat as a whole,” and that,
      finally, “They do not set up any sectarian principles of their own, by which to shape and mould the proletarian
      movement.”<sup id="ch05--91" class="calibre13"><a id="ch05fn10" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch05--93" href="39_split_000.html#ch05fn10-r">10</a></sup>The operative word in the last sentence is <em id="ch05--94" class="calibre8">sectarian.</em>

    <div class="indent" id="ch05--95">
      3. <em id="ch05--96" class="calibre8">Organizing the unorganized.</em> This requires no special discussion here. We have seen that
      this task was one of the great differences between the “New Unionism” and the old, and one of the features of the
      former that excited Engels’ enthusiasm. An allied question is the organization by the trade-union movement of the
      unemployed, especially in depression periods. No policy question is more closely related to the basic class
      character of the movement, indicating whether a trade <a id="page_122" class="calibre6"></a>union operates as an exclusive guild
      or job trust rather than an arm of the class.
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="ch05--98">
      4. <em id="ch05--99" class="calibre8">Trade-union democracy.</em> Programmatic insistence on the democratic control of a union by
      its membership does not stem simply from abstract concern with the values of democracy in general. It is, rather,
      an important antidote to the pressures of bourgeoisification and cooptation that we have discussed. Assuming that
      leaders as individuals are no more venal or corrupt than rank-and-file members, it is still true that leadership
      and official position puts an individual under the pressure of employers in particular and bourgeois society in
      general. These pressures come from two directions. One is the obvious allurement of rewards and blandishments
      from above, whether these are direct or indirect bribes or merely the enticements of social cooptation. Another
      is the fact that trade-union officials become <em id="ch05--100" class="calibre8">ex</em>-workers; they cease to live the same
      life as their fellow workers, even with the best of intentions, to a small or great degree; the conditions of
      existence change, and a change of consciousness may follow. Trade-union democracy maximizes the counterpressure
      of the working-class ranks on them. The institutions of proletarian democracy are also an indispensable school
      for training working-class cadres in the administration and surveillance of society itself, for making the class
      fit to rule, as we have discussed.<sup id="ch05--101" class="calibre13"><a id="ch05fn11" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch05--103" href="39_split_000.html#ch05fn11-r">11</a></sup> Nor do these considerations exhaust the case for trade-union democracy as
      a vital part of Marx’s program.
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="ch05--104">
      Marx had occasion to raise the issue of trade-union democracy directly when the German Lassallean organization
      was setting up its party-controlled trade unions in 1868 (on which, more later). In a letter to its leader, J. B.
      von Schweitzer, Marx (writing as the German secretary of the International) objected to the system of internal
      “dictatorship” being established.<a id="ch05en2-r" class="calibre6"></a><a class="nounder1" id="ch05--106" href="43.html#ch05en2">*</a>

      As for the draft Rules, I consider them erroneous in principle, and I believe I have had as much experience in
      the trade-union field as any of my contemporaries. Without going further into details, I only want to remark that
      <em id="ch05--108" class="calibre8">centralist</em> organization, although very useful for secret societies and sectarian
      movements, goes against the nature of trade unions. Even if it were desirable— I state outright that it is
      impossible—it would not be possible; and least of all in Germany. Here where the worker’s life is <a id="page_123" class="calibre6"></a>regulated from childhood on by bureaucracy and he himself believes in the authorities, in the
      bodies appointed over him, he must be taught before all else to walk by himself.<sup id="ch05--110" class="calibre13"><a id="ch05fn12" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch05--112" href="39_split_000.html#ch05fn12-r">12</a></sup>
    </div>

    <div class="noindent" id="ch05--113">
      In this letter Marx pointed specifically to that part of the Rules which placed the office of the president
      (Schweitzer himself) above the membership. “And to have this now in a trade-union movement! The latter revolves
      largely around money questions and you will soon discover that here all dictatorship comes to an end.” This
      prediction was true in Schweitzer’s case.
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="ch05--114">
      5. <em id="ch05--115" class="calibre8">Independent political action.</em> Finally, Marx considered it essential that the
      trade-union movement progress from a narrow preoccupation with economic, or bread-and-butter, issues alone, to
      the larger issues of society, in short, the field of politics in the broadest sense. In Marx’s view, this was a
      necessity from the standpoint of the trade unions’ own practical considerations in the long run; for the
      effectiveness of pure-and-simple unionism begins to dwindle as it develops and as it encounters more complicated
      problems. Marx thought that one of the single biggest accomplishments of the International was that “We have
      succeeded in drawing into the movement the one really big workers’ organization, the English ‘<em id="ch05--116" class="calibre8">Trades-Unions,</em>’ which formerly concerned themselves <em id="ch05--117" class="calibre8">exclusively</em> with

      “In due time” the unions did turn to political action, though not on Marx’s schedule. It was a question of
      establishing the direction. A quarter century later, Engels’ series of popular articles for workers still had to
      point the direction, for it was to be another decade before English labor moved definitively into politics. His
      articles were peppered with arguments for independent political action. The central passage, in an article
      entitled “A Working Men’s Party,” makes a point we have not yet mentioned.
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="ch05--139">
      Engels begins by recalling that “The working class has interests of its own, political as well as social,” but
      English workers leave their political interests in the hands of the capitalist class’s parties. Many Continental
      countries are ahead of them in this respect. But there is a widespread feeling that this course is now obsolete
      and impractical:
    </div>

    <div class="bq" id="ch05--140">
      Thinking men of all classes begin to see that a new line must be struck out, and that this line can only be in
      the direction of democracy. But in England, where the industrial and agricultural working class forms the immense
      majority of the people, democracy means the dominion of the working class, neither more nor less.<sup id="ch05--141" class="calibre13"><a id="ch05fn16" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch05--143" href="39_split_000.html#ch05fn16-r">16</a></sup>

      Then let that working class prepare itself for its ruling responsibilities. The best way is “to use the power

      Parliament.

    <div class="bqi" id="ch05--145">
      Moreover, in England a real democratic party is impossible unless it be a working men’s party. Enlightened men of
      other classes (where they are not so plentiful as people would make us believe) might join that party and even
      represent it in Parliament after having given pledges of their sincerity…. But no democratic party in England, as
      well as elsewhere, will be effectively successful unless it has a distinct working-class character. Abandon that,

      His series of articles had already argued that the trade unions must orient toward achieving a new socialist
      society. Now he is pointing out that even within the cadre of the old society, it is only a working-class party

      While urging a socialist perspective, neither Engels nor Marx confronted the trade unions with the ultimatistic
      demand that they must adopt socialism as their political banner or else suffer the slings and arrows of sect
      denunciation. The five points listed would fit the unions for broader societal tasks; they point a direction to
      be urged, beginning with the most elementary activities of economic defense, and ending (in due time) with the
      trade-unionists’ conscious adoption of a workers’ state as their programmatic aim. This defines a spectrum of
      trade-union consciousness, and it provides the framework for helping to move the trade unions along the road to
      political awareness.

    <div class="indent" id="ch05--154">
      In the language of the movement, it became standard to speak of the trade unions as the economic arm of the
      working class, the proletarian party as the political arm; and we have already used this two-armed metaphor in
      the preceding section. It is, however, misleading in suggesting that the two arms are merely coordinate, of equal
      standing. In Marx’s view, this is not so, as we will see in section 6 below. There is another possible
      misunderstanding to be cleared up as well.
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="ch05--155">
      In a couple of statements we have quoted, Marx seems to be blurring the difference between economic and political
      action. The <em id="ch05--156" class="calibre8">Communist Manifesto</em> said that “every class struggle is a political struggle,”
      repeating a formulation that had appeared the year before in Marx’s polemic against Proudhon.<sup id="ch05--157" class="calibre13"><a id="ch05fn18" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch05--159" href="39_split_000.html#ch05fn18-r">18</a></sup> What
      does this mean? Is every trade-union struggle—say, one over wages—a political struggle? There are two parts to
      the answer.
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="ch05--160">
      In the first place, this aphoristic formula of 1847-1848 is still tinged with Marx’s early views. Marx always
      looked on the trade-union movement as a process in the class struggle, on various levels. In the course of
      maturation the working class moved nearer the goals set by society’s evolution. On the highest level the working
      class confronted society-wide <a id="page_126" class="calibre6"></a>responsibility. In the politico-philosophic language of the
      milieu in which Marx’s thinking first developed, it was society-wide (or human-community-wide) tasks that defined
      the word <em id="ch05--162" class="calibre8">political.</em> <a id="ch05en3-r" class="calibre6"></a><a class="nounder1" id="ch05--164" href="43.html#ch05en3">*</a> This broad usage—much broader than the <em id="ch05--165" class="calibre8">political</em> we are used
      to—still conditions the language we have quoted.
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="ch05--166">
      Secondly, the statement takes on the air of an aphorism by dint of drastic condensation (which is one of the
      characteristics of the Manifesto in general). It is not simply making the point that a <em id="ch05--167" class="calibre8">class-wide</em> struggle tends to turn to overtly political action, though this is true. The struggle
      is implicitly political, impinging on political power, even before the proletariat may actually go over to open
      political activity. When a class war reaches a high level, it is already a political struggle insofar as such a
      struggle no longer merely involves concessions by a ruling class to a subject class but, rather, objectively
      raises the question of which class will rule society. At this level, the stakes are state power, whether the
      combatants know it or not.
    </div>

    <div class="indentb" id="ch05--168">
      As it happens, a quarter century later Marx had occasion to go over this ground again, in a letter to a German
      socialist in America. Here he emphasizes the class-wide and generalized nature of the struggle.
    </div>

    <div class="bqi2" id="ch05--169">
      The political movement of the working class has as its ultimate object, of course, the conquest of political
      power for this class, and this naturally requires a °previous organization° of the working class developed up to
      a certain point and arising precisely from its economic struggles.
    </div>

    <div class="bqi2" id="ch05--170">
      On the other hand, however, every movement in which the working class comes out as a <em id="ch05--171" class="calibre8">class</em> against the ruling classes and tries to coerce them by °pressure from without° is a
      political movement. For instance, the attempt in a particular factory or even in a particular trade to force a
      shorter working day out of individual capitalists by strikes, etc., is a purely economic movement. On the other
      hand the movement to force through an eight-hour, etc. <em id="ch05--172" class="calibre8">law</em> is a <em id="ch05--173" class="calibre8">political</em> movement. And in this way, out of the separate economic movements of the workers there
      grows up everywhere a <em id="ch05--174" class="calibre8">political</em> movement, that is to say, a movement of the <em id="ch05--175" class="calibre8">class</em>, with the object of enforcing its interests in a general <a id="page_127" class="calibre6"></a>form, in a
      form possessing general, socially coercive force. While these movements presuppose a certain degree of previous

      This explanation was written under the pressure of the Bakuninist campaign to prohibit the International from
      engaging in political activity; Marx has to explain that politics has a broader social horizon than electoral
      politics. At about the same time Marx was still putting the same thought with the former conciseness, by writing
      that Bakunin “has not even seen that every class movement <em id="ch05--181" class="calibre8">as</em> a class movement, is
      necessarily and was always a <em id="ch05--182" class="calibre8">political</em> movement.”<sup id="ch05--183" class="calibre13"><a id="ch05fn21" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch05--185" href="39_split_000.html#ch05fn21-r">21</a></sup>

    <h3 class="h2" id="ch05lev3">3. THE EXPERIMENT IN THE INTERNATIONAL</h3>

    <div class="indent" id="ch05--195">
      As trade unions move toward independent political action, problems are raised about the relationship of two
      currents: trade-unionists who are reaching out toward the broader realm of social and political issues in order
      to implement their economic aspirations, and political revolutionists who look to the trade-union movement as a
      means of effectuating their aims. These two currents may overlap in personnel, or merge in the case of
      individuals, but they tend to exist separately as movements, that is, as autonomous arms of the working-class
      movement.
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="ch05--196">
      The International, however, was an early experiment in hybrid organization, combining trade-union organizations
      with political (and other) organizations under one structural roof. This experiment had not <a id="page_128" class="calibre6"></a>been so planned; it happened that way, out of the first coming together of the French Proudhonists
      and the English trade-unionists in the St. Martin’s Hall mass meeting that launched the International in 1864.
      The statutes (Rules) as well as the Inaugural Address, and the structure that developed, were all tailored to
      that reality. But in the long run the combination proved to be unviable; it necessarily led to intolerable
      strains; and after this experience the working-class movement had to proceed with the two-arm pattern.
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="ch05--198">
      The situation was helped by the fact that, fortunately, Proudhonism as a theory and a movement was declining by
      this time; but time was still needed to bring its representatives toward tolerance of union organization and
      strikes. Symbol of the initial situation was the fact that Marx had to leave the very mention of trade unions out
      of the Inaugural Address. For this and other reasons, the International did not provide a model for a solution of
      the two-current problem; it only made a beginning; and this limitation must be kept in mind.
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="ch05--199">
      Marx’s essential role in the General Council of the International was working out the framework of collaboration
      between the mixture of Continental revolutionaries and semirevolutionaries on the one hand, and, on the other, a
      heterogeneous group of English trade-unionists, including many who were essentially reform-minded, others averse
      to politics of any kind, and some averse to independent politics and inclined to immersion in Liberalism. From
      the beginning he had to guide the strained alliance through a series of whirlpools and dangerous rapids. This
      task could have been accomplished only by someone who stood outside and above the various narrow viewpoints, and
      saw a farther goal.
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="ch05--200">
      It should be clear from the preceding chapter why Marx had no compunction whatsoever about collaborating in this
      way—the pejorative term is hobnobbing—with that section of the trade-union officialdom which in the conditions of
      the time was playing a progressive role. There would be a reason to devote a section of this chapter to a
      detailed presentation of Marx’s amazingly successful and fruitful work with these trade-union leaders over a
      number of years; without this material the emphasis in this section is skewed, for we will put the spotlight on
      the eventual negative outcome rather than on the positive practical work, which was of considerable value to the
      British working-class movement. Fortunately, this job is done in an excellent book, <em id="ch05--201" class="calibre8">Karl Marx
      and the British Labour Movement</em>, by Collins and Abramsky. <a id="page_129" class="calibre6"></a>Reading it is the equivalent
      of a <em id="ch05--203" class="calibre8">very</em> long Special Note appended to this volume.
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="ch05--204">
      The alliance broke up when its trade-union wing ceased to move in a progressive direction. To be sure, it was
      rocked by the Paris Commune and the daring position which the International was led by Marx to take on this
      heinous subversion of civilization (so described by the bourgeois press). But, more decisively, it began falling
      apart as the British trade-unionists moved into another kind of politics—bourgeois politics. It was not Marx but
      the trade-unionist wing that became restless and finally fractious because of the direction in which the
      International was steadily developing.
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="ch05--205">
      The question of support to the Paris Commune did not at first enter as a divisive issue. When Marx read his
      address on <em id="ch05--206" class="calibre8">The Civil War in France</em> to the General Council, it was adopted unanimously and
      without a murmur of dissent.<sup id="ch05--207" class="calibre13"><a id="ch05fn23" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch05--209" href="39_split_000.html#ch05fn23-r">23</a></sup> To be sure, the subsequent blast of horror-stricken denunciation in the press
      made weak knees tremble and reinforced pre-existing tendencies; but for some time after, the most schismatic of
      the reformists (John Hales in particular) put on a left face by ganging up with the Bakuninists against Marx. In
      short, the split between Marx and the British trade-unionists was not brought about because Marx insisted on
      lining the International up on the side of an unpopular radical issue in France. While it was not Marx who
      decided that the progressive alliance called the International had to be broken, he had to recognize when the
      strain of rightward drift became intolerable.<sup id="ch05--210" class="calibre13"><a id="ch05fn24" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch05--212" href="39_split_000.html#ch05fn24-r">24</a></sup>

      Marx had seen the signs even before the Commune crisis. Less than a year before, soon after the Franco-Prussian
      War had started, he wrote his French friends that the English workers were right in saying “A plague on both
      their houses” and in opposing designs by the “English oligarchy” to support war against France, and he added:

      was expected to vote with Marx) on no stated ground whatever. Instead of giving reasons, Mottershead made the

      Marx says that whom a section elects is no one else’s concern; moreover, it redounds to Barry’s honor that he
      does not belong among the so-called leaders of the English workers, since these people are more or less bought up
      by the bourgeoisie and the government; Barry was attacked only because he would not serve as Hales’s tool.<a id="ch05en4-r" class="calibre6"></a><a class="nounder1" id="ch05--228" href="43.html#ch05en4">*</a>

      Marx’s outspoken denunciation formalized the end of the two-current alliance for a whole period, as the
      trade-union leaders shifted their alliance to an entirely different current. The labor movement was entering into
      an era of bureaucratic encrustation which lasted until the “New Unionism.” Marx and Engels later referred back to
      this break only with satisfaction at having done their duty. Shortly after the Hague Congress, Hales tried to
      stir up the General Council against Marx because of the latter’s disrespectful remarks about labor leaders, but
      his efforts only boomeranged against him.<sup id="ch05--230" class="calibre13"><a id="ch05fn32" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch05--232" href="39_split_000.html#ch05fn32-r">32</a></sup> At the end of the year, Engels <a id="page_131" class="calibre6"></a>noted that

    <div class="bqi" id="ch05--253">
      The English working class has been gradually becoming more and more deeply demoralized by the period of
      corruption since 1848 and had at last got to the point when it was nothing more than the tail of the Great
      Liberal Party, i.e., of its <em id="ch05--254" class="calibre8">oppressors</em>, the capitalists. Its direction had passed
      completely into the hands of the venal trade-union leaders and professional agitators. These fellows shouted and
      howled behind the Gladstones, Brights, Mundellas, Morleys and the whole gang of factory owners, etc., <em id="ch05--255" class="calibre8">in majorem gloriam</em> [to the greater glory] of the Tsar as the emancipator of nations, while they

    </div>

    <div class="noindent" id="ch05--259">
      In 1887, referring back to such labor leaders and their parliamentary <a id="page_132" class="calibre6"></a>aspirations, Engels
      wrote that “We had to fight them since the founding of the International.”<sup id="ch05--261" class="calibre13"><a id="ch05fn39" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch05--263" href="39_split_000.html#ch05fn39-r">39</a></sup> But “we” had also had to
      work with them—up to a point, and with certain preconditions.
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="ch05--264">
      And so the organizational formula of the International proved itself to be an enlightening experiment by failing.
      At the International’s 1871 conference, the resolution on political action had said that “in the militant state
      of the working class, its economical movement and its political action are indissolubly united.”<sup id="ch05--265" class="calibre13"><a id="ch05fn40" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch05--267" href="39_split_000.html#ch05fn40-r">40</a></sup> United
      in one organization? This form of unity was very dissoluble indeed. And yet unity in some form was vital to the
      success of both arms of the movement.
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="ch05--268">
      Separation into two autonomous arms raised its own problems. In England the trade-union movement (before and
      after the International, and outside of it) grew up for decades without any workers’ political movement in
      existence-, in Germany the socialist movement came into existence first, and was instrumental in creating the
      economic organizations. From these different directions, there was always the problem of cohabitation.
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="ch05--269">
      In the former type of case—trade unions without a political movement alongside—it was a question of establishing
      the missing arm. This is what Engels told his trade-union readers in his article series of 1881:
    </div>

    <div class="bq" id="ch05--270">
      This knowledge [that the fundamental evil is the wages system itself] once generally spread amongst the working
      class, the position of Trades Unions must change considerably. They will no longer enjoy the privilege of being
      the only organisations of the working class. At the side of, or above, the Unions of special trades there must
      spring up a general Union, a political organisation of the working class as a whole.<sup id="ch05--271" class="calibre13"><a id="ch05fn41" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch05--273" href="39_split_000.html#ch05fn41-r">41</a></sup>
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="ch05--274">
      There was a similar problem in the United States, which typically could not be grasped by the sectist minds of
      the Socialist Labor Party groups there. In 1891 the New York section of the S.L.P. decided to affiliate to the
      Central Labor Federation of the city (as if the latter were the International), and the American Federation of
      Labor under Gompers refused to charter the city federation because of the socialist affiliation. Engels gave the
      opinion that the socialist sect was in the wrong for insisting. The A.F.L. was an association of trade unions
      only; hence it had the “formal right” to reject non-trade-union bodies. “I cannot judge from here, of course,”
      added Engels, “whether it was <em id="ch05--275" class="calibre8">propagandistically</em> advisable to expose oneself to such a
      rejection. But it <a id="page_133" class="calibre6"></a>was beyond question that it had to come, and I, for one, cannot blame
      Gompers for it.”<sup id="ch05--277" class="calibre13"><a id="ch05fn42" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch05--279" href="39_split_000.html#ch05fn42-r">42</a></sup>

    <h3 class="h2" id="ch05lev4">4. EXPERIMENT IN PARTY-CONTROLLED TRADE UNIONS</h3>

    <div class="indent" id="ch05--282">
      In Germany, where political organization had pre-empted the field, could the indissoluble unity of the two arms
      be ensured by simply making trade-unionism an arm of the political party? The same sectist mentalities that had
      led the Socialist Labor Party of America in this direction also dominated the Lassallean organization in Germany.
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="ch05--283">
      The first socialist group in Germany, founded by Lassalle, had arisen entirely within the tradition of hostility
      to trade unions that was characteristic of all pre-Marx socialism. But in the 1860s, trade unions started forming
      without the Lassalleans’ permission. By 1868, the Lassallean organization, now led by J. B. von Schweitzer, was
      faced with the threat of a congress, called for Berlin, which was going to consider setting up a broad
      trade-union movement. The majority of the Lassalleans were in favor of a point-blank hostile attitude to the
      trade-union congress, as an enemy encroachment on their turf. Schweitzer, however, jammed through a more flexible
      tactic to achieve a similar end: his party organization would not kill but rather take over the rival movement,
      and then make sure it remained a creature of the political leadership without real autonomy. Its constituent
      trade unions would be controlled, by statute and in a formal manner, by the leadership of the party—that is, by
      Schweitzer. Thus his way of scotching the danger of an independent trade-union movement was to make it an
      appendage to his political empire.
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="ch05--284">
      Marx set his face strongly against this course: the trade unions must be built on the basis of organizational
      autonomy in order to perform their basic functions in a healthy manner. Then this autonomous movement would have
      to decide, soon or late, its own relationship to the political movement of the class, with the socialists within
      it pressing for their own position on this like everyone else.
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="ch05--285">
      <a id="page_134" class="calibre6"></a>This, to Marx, meant “the development of a <em id="ch05--287" class="calibre8">real</em> workers’
      organization in Germany based on trade unions.” Schweitzer (wrote Marx to Engels) was afraid that in this case
      “his artificial league of sectarians °would soon be nowhere.°”<sup id="ch05--288" class="calibre13"><a id="ch05fn43" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch05--290" href="39_split_000.html#ch05fn43-r">43</a></sup> Engels agreed that the Berlin congress must be “a
      <em id="ch05--291" class="calibre8">real</em> workers’ congress, not simply a duplicate of the [Lassallean] congress” with no one
      but Lassalleans in its ranks.<sup id="ch05--292" class="calibre13"><a id="ch05fn44" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch05--294" href="39_split_000.html#ch05fn44-r">44</a></sup> Furthermore, wrote Engels, it appears from the Lassallean paper that Schweitzer
      would like to carry over the “rigid structure” of his party organization to the trade-union movement; and this,
      Engels thought, was unlikely to succeed since the workers would not stand for dictatorship over their economic
      livelihood.<sup id="ch05--295" class="calibre13"><a id="ch05fn45" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch05--297" href="39_split_000.html#ch05fn45-r">45</a></sup> Once he lost his tight organization and was no longer able to “play at
      dictator,” the change would be fatal to him.<sup id="ch05--298" class="calibre13"><a id="ch05fn46" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch05--300" href="39_split_000.html#ch05fn46-r">46</a></sup> Marx was of the same opinion: “… Schweitzer thinks he can
      simply replace his dictatorship over the [Lassallean] G.G.W.A. with a dictatorship over the German working class.
      This is very naive.”<sup id="ch05--301" class="calibre13"><a id="ch05fn47" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch05--303" href="39_split_000.html#ch05fn47-r">47</a></sup>
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="ch05--304">
      As the issue came to a head Marx prepared to state his views to Schweitzer in explicit terms. He told Engels in
      advance that he was going to attack Schweitzer’s position that “two organizations can only be harmful” and that
      the trade-union organization must give way to the political. Schweitzer wanted “his own workers’ movement,” but
      Marx’s letter would “make clear to him that he must choose between the ‘sect’ and the ‘class.’”<sup id="ch05--305" class="calibre13"><a id="ch05fn48" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch05--307" href="39_split_000.html#ch05fn48-r">48</a></sup> This
      Marx did some days later, in an important letter from which we have already quoted his views on party
      democracy.<sup id="ch05--308" class="calibre13"><a id="ch05fn49" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch05--310" href="39_split_000.html#ch05fn49-r">49</a></sup> The main burden of the letter was insistence on the autonomy of the burgeoning
      trade unions from party dictatorship. As planned, this was cast in the form of insistence on the independence of
      the movement of the “class” (trade unions) from the “sect” (the Lassallean party).
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="ch05--311">
      Lassalle, explained Marx, made the mistake of founding a sect: “instead of looking among the genuine elements of
      the class movement for the real basis of his agitation, he wanted to prescribe the course to be followed by this
      movement according to a certain doctrinaire recipe.” What defines a sect? In this letter Marx put it as follows:
      “The sect sees the justification for its existence and its point of honor not in what it has in <em id="ch05--312" class="calibre8">common</em> with the class movement but in the <em id="ch05--313" class="calibre8">particular shibboleth</em> which
      <em id="ch05--314" class="calibre8">distinguishes</em> it from the movement.”
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="ch05--315">
      The rise of the trade unions as real workers’ organizations (continued Marx) gave the Lassallean sect the
      opportunity “to merge in the class movement and make an end of all sectarianism.” Its political <a id="page_135" class="calibre6"></a>content would then be carried into the broader movement “as an element enriching it.” Instead,
      “you [Schweitzer] actually demanded of the class movement that it should subordinate itself to the movement of a
      particular sect.” Therefore the suspicion arises that “whatever happens you want to preserve your ‘own workers’
      movement.’” Instead of collaborating with other socialists in connection with the Berlin trade-union congress,
      you Lassalleans simply took over control; as for the others, “you only left them the alternative of either
      <em id="ch05--317" class="calibre8">joining</em> you or <em id="ch05--318" class="calibre8">opposing</em> you,” and gave the congress the
      appearance of a mere “enlarged edition” of the preceding Lassallean party congress.<sup id="ch05--319" class="calibre13"><a id="ch05fn50" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch05--321" href="39_split_000.html#ch05fn50-r">50</a></sup>
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="ch05--322">
      Such “enlarged editions” of a controlling party later became known as front organizations. This is what Engels
      had in mind in writing to Marx a few days later. The Lassallean sectarians intend that their political
      organization
    </div>

    <div class="bq" id="ch05--323">
      will play the same role in the new trades unions (only publicly) as our old secret league [Communist League] did
      in the public workers’ associations. The trades unions will form only the exoteric section of the Only True
      Lassallean Church, but the latter remains the Only True Church.<sup id="ch05--324" class="calibre13"><a id="ch05fn51" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch05--326" href="39_split_000.html#ch05fn51-r">51</a></sup>
    </div>

    <div class="noindent" id="ch05--327">
      In 1847-1848 the Communist League, in London and elsewhere, organized the German Workers Educational Association
      as such an “exoteric section” (front organization), as a broader recruiting and agitational arena and as the
      legal front of a movement which might be outlawed. While no longer conspiratorially organized, the League still
      recognized the need for secrecy: this was one difference from the Lassalleans’ situation. Secondly, a real
      trade-union movement, as the elementary movement of the working class, could not be regarded in the same light as
      an ordinary club or a social-fraternal-educational society; the comparison showed what was wrong with the
      sectarian conception of the Lassalleans.<a id="ch05en5-r" class="calibre6"></a><a class="nounder1" id="ch05--329" href="43.html#ch05en5">*</a>

    <h3 class="h2" id="ch05lev5"><a id="page_136" class="calibre15"></a>5. THE PRIMACY OF THE POLITICAL MOVEMENT</h3>

    <div class="indent" id="ch05--332">
      Insistence on the organizational autonomy of the trade unions, however, does not settle the problem of the
      relationship between the two arms of the class; it only makes a healthy solution possible. It could not be an end
      in itself for Marx, or for anyone who denied that the trade-union struggle by itself could emancipate the
      proletariat, and who believed that the class struggle in its generalized form tended to become a political
      struggle. The general war had to be led by a general staff that was conscious of the general political tasks and
      organized around these tasks.
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="ch05--333">
      For Marx, therefore, the political movement is primary, that is, it should assume the overall leadership of the
      class. In the light of Marx’s controversy with Schweitzer among other enlightening episodes, this primacy of the
      political movement can be spelled out as follows: The political organization of revolutionists which aspires to
      be accepted as leader of the class-in-movement has the job of convincing the autonomous trade-union movement to
      follow its counsels and policies. This is its essential trade-union work.
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="ch05--334">
      Moreover, we must now add that the picture has been considerably oversimplified by talking about only <em id="ch05--335" class="calibre8">two</em> arms of movements of labor. Already in Marx’s and Engels’ time there were other arms of the
      labor movement developing: cooperatives, cultural and educational organizations, an independent as well as a
      party press, special protective funds, and so on. If the needs of the struggle required that there be a certain
      amount of coordination and congruence among the lesser and greater arms of the labor movement, Marx—and most
      others—had no doubt that the political movement was in the best position to provide such leadership and guidance.
      This was not a very controversial question in most quarters. The problem was how this task of the political
      organization should be carried out, not to speak of by whom.
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="ch05--336">
      For Marx, certain elementary considerations are dictated by his approach to the problem. By its nature the
      trade-union movement consists—and should consist—of workers at quite different stages and <a id="page_137" class="calibre6"></a>degrees of class-consciousness, trade-union consciousness, and political consciousness. Considered
      as a school, it has an infinite number of grades, or gradations, from primitive wage-consciousness all the way to
      full agreement with a revolutionary socialist program. As they approach the latter end of the spectrum, workers
      will tend to join the political party of socialism, perhaps recruited by fellow workers who have gone before
      them. They in turn may seek to recruit their brothers and sisters in the unions. Thus the trade unions are in
      part a recruiting ground for the political movement. Where could it want a better one? asked Engels. Writing of
      the desirability of getting a big A.F.L. delegation from the United States to come to the International Socialist
      Congress at Brussels in 1891, he remarked, “They would see many things there that would disconcert them in their
      narrowminded trade-union standpoint—and besides, where do you want to find a recruiting ground if not in the
      trade unions?”<sup id="ch05--338" class="calibre13"><a id="ch05fn54" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch05--340" href="39_split_000.html#ch05fn54-r">54</a></sup> Twenty years before, in a letter offering general advice to the American
      section of the International, Marx spelled this out: “The Trades Union you must try to win °at all
      costs.°”<sup id="ch05--341" class="calibre13"><a id="ch05fn55" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch05--343" href="39_split_000.html#ch05fn55-r">55</a></sup>
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="ch05--344">
      But the trade-union movement is not merely a recruiting ground from Marx’s standpoint, since it has its own
      elementary functions whether there is a political movement or not. Since it is also an arena of continuing
      struggle, the political party will not aim to “graduate” its trade-union recruits out of their unions (in the
      usual meaning of recruitment), but rather will be interested in forming a consciously revolutionary cadre of
      socialist trade-unionists inside this basic class movement, to fructify and leaven its work along the lines
      discussed in section 1 of this chapter. In fact, recruitment does not chiefly mean gaining members but making
      adherents; short of that, bringing as many trade-unionists as possible nearer political agreement. In a word, the
      ability of a political party to lead and guide the trade unions would be decided by its ability to develop a
      framework of socialist members and supporters inside the economic arm.
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="ch05--345">
      Thus a type of unity between the two arms could be established which would be entirely different in operation and
      in consequences from Schweitzer’s simple mechanism of party dictatorship. In 1878—after the Lassallean group had
      disappeared by merger into the German Social-Democracy and after the Bebel-Liebknecht policy of autonomous trade
      unions had triumphed—Engels praised the German movement <a id="page_138" class="calibre6"></a>for the symbiotic relationship of
      mutual reinforcement that had taken shape:
    </div>

    <div class="bqi" id="ch05--347">
      °°A great advantage to the German movement is that the Trades’ organization works hand in hand with the political
      organization. The immediate advantages offered by the Trades’ organization draw many an otherwise indifferent
      mass into the political movement, while the community of political action hold[s] together, and assures mutual
      support to, the otherwise isolated Trades Unions.<sup id="ch05--348" class="calibre13"><a id="ch05fn56" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch05--350" href="39_split_000.html#ch05fn56-r">56</a></sup>
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="ch05--351">
      In seeking to give political guidance to the trade unions, a proletarian political movement differs in no way
      formally from the bourgeois parties, particularly the bourgeois liberal parties which have traditionally sought
      to make the labor movement part of its own entourage and recruit its forces and energies for the liberals’
      political fortunes. Marx, as we have seen, was in a position to watch this working out, as his former
      trade-unionist colleagues of the General Council went over to the Liberal Party and then—seeing the world turned
      left to right in their new ideological mirrors—bitterly accused socialists of “meddling” in their unions as
      outside agitators. Indeed, it became a tradition that the same trade-union bureaucracy which systematically used
      its own apparatus inside the unions to subordinate them to bourgeois politics, indignantly denounced efforts by a
      workers’ party to reach the membership as somehow illegitimate if not downright subversive.<a id="ch05en6-r" class="calibre6"></a><a class="nounder1" id="ch05--353" href="43.html#ch05en6">*</a>
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="ch05--354">
      The view that the political struggle is primary was not in the least peculiar to Marx, nor to socialism. Inside
      the socialist movement, however, an alternative view—that it is the trade-union movement that should be regarded
      as sufficient for the road to socialism—cropped up occasionally and crystallized as <em id="ch05--355" class="calibre8">syndicalism;</em> it will be discussed in the last section of this chapter.

    <div class="indent" id="ch05--358">
      For Marx the exact form of the relationship to be established between the trade unions and a workers’ party was
      an open question, depending on the development of both movements in a particular country and time. It was neither
      necessary nor possible to establish prefabricated models or molds. Writing to Spanish workers on behalf of the
      General Council and hence also of Marx, Engels explained:
    </div>

    <div class="bq" id="ch05--359">
      Experience has everywhere proved that the best means of liberating the workers from this domination of the old
      parties is to found in each country a proletarian party with its own policy, a policy clearly distinguished from
      that of other parties, since it has to express the conditions of emancipation of the working class. The details
      of this policy may vary according to the particular circumstances in each country…<sup id="ch05--360" class="calibre13"><a id="ch05fn58" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch05--362" href="39_split_000.html#ch05fn58-r">58</a></sup>

    <div class="noindent" id="ch05--363">
      Even more, the details of organizational form would be sure to vary. We have touched on the different pattern of
      development in Germany and England; let us sketch Marx’s reaction to events in these countries.
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="ch05--364">
      In 1869 Wilhelm Liebknecht—after long prodding by Marx—was finally impelled by events to break with his
      long-standing policy of opportunist alliance with a bourgeois liberal party; he went along with the founding of a
      new socialist party that offered an alternative to the Lassallean sect. This party, founded at Eisenach, was
      based largely on trade-unionists—from the trade-union wing of the Lassalleans breaking with the Schweitzer
      dictatorship, and from independent trade unions that had been founded with Bebel’s help on an autonomous model.
      But the new “Eisenacher” party was not based on the trade unions in its organizational structure (in the way that
      the British Labor Party is today), nor did it aim at being so constituted. Such an organic relationship might
      have stunted the development of both arms.
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="ch05--365">
      Marx greeted this step as a positive one, and supported the Eisenacher party. This did not lead him to believe
      that this German pattern was a model for England.

      In England the politicalization of labor was going through painful stages. Far behind was the Chartist period,
      when voteless workers <a id="page_140" class="calibre6"></a>barged into the political process as a revolutionary force from the
      outside. As the workers received the ballot, it became worth the while of the bourgeois parties to take them in
      tow. The Reform Bill of 1867, by the same token, made it possible for labor leaders to think of rising to heights
      commensurate with their ambitions. Two prerequisites were votes and money; the former could be traded for the
      latter. The votes were to come from workers; the money had to be begged from the Liberal moneybags, such as the
      industrialist Samuel Morley, a leading political broker. The labor leader George Howell, having left the General
      Council of the International in 1869, plaintively wrote to a bourgeois politician: “Cannot something be done to
      pave the way for a few working men to go into the House? Some of us have to stand in the character of
      obstructives [inside the trade unions] because we will not consent to the revival of the old Chartist Practice,
      that of opposing all parties except those pledged to labour questions.”<sup id="ch05--368" class="calibre13"><a id="ch05fn59" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch05--370" href="39_split_000.html#ch05fn59-r">59</a></sup> He pointed in alarm to
      the fact that proposals for “direct representation of labour” were cropping up “in a most unpleasant manner.”

      “Nobody holds it against the ‘labor leaders’ that they would have liked to get into Parliament,” wrote Engels in
      the German press after the 1874 elections. “The shortest way would have been to proceed at once to form anew a
      strong workers’ party with a definite program …” But instead—
    </div>

    <div class="bq" id="ch05--372">
      In order to get into Parliament the “labor leaders” had recourse, in the first place, to the votes and money of
      the bourgeoisie and only in the second place to the votes of the workers themselves. But by doing so they ceased
      to be workers’ candidates and turned themselves into bourgeois candidates. They did not appeal to a working-class
      party that still had to be formed but to the bourgeois “great Liberal Party.”
    </div>

    <div class="noindent" id="ch05--373">
      To further their careers in bourgeois politics, they set up a Labor Representation League, and, under the
      guidance of the Liberal industrialist, “drew up a ‘labor program’ to which any bourgeois could subscribe and
      which was to form the foundation of a mighty movement to chain the workers politically still more firmly to the
      bourgeoisie and, as these gentry thought, to get the ‘founders’ into Parliament.”<sup id="ch05--374" class="calibre13"><a id="ch05fn60" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch05--376" href="39_split_000.html#ch05fn60-r">60</a></sup>

    <div class="indent" id="ch05--377">
      The case was better when unions went for “direct representation”; in the 1874 election, miners’ unions got two
      union secretaries into Parliament. “At any rate,” wrote Engels, “the ice has been broken and <a id="page_141" class="calibre6"></a>two workers now have seats in the most fashionable debating club of Europe …” They would not be
      able to play a role in Parliament, he added, but still “the elections of 1874 have indisputably ushered in a new
      phase in English political development.”<sup id="ch05--379" class="calibre13"><a id="ch05fn61" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch05--381" href="39_split_000.html#ch05fn61-r">61</a></sup>

    <div class="indent" id="ch05--382">
      These were halting efforts and half-way forms as compared with the step that Marx advocated, an openly
      independent workers’ party; and indeed he and Engels criticized publicly and privately the inadequacy of the ways
      in which the labor leaders were moving into politics. At the same time they exhibited the objectively progressive
      meaning of what was actually happening, for they were not victims of the later mystique according to which
      anything tagged “progressive” must be advocated and supported. It was by criticism, not approval, that they
      sought to move the advanced elements of the class beyond the bourgeoisified forms in which they were still
      imprisoned.

    <div class="indent" id="ch05--383">
      One of the progressive consequences of the new steps taken by the labor leaders in pursuit of their political
      ambitions was—these leaders’ self-exposure. Such exposure as the outcome of experience was one of the most
      important processes in the education of a class. Just before the 1874 election Engels had written to a German
      comrade that he hoped the ambitious bureaucrats <em id="ch05--384" class="calibre8">would</em> get elected:

    <div class="bqi" id="ch05--385">

      BY THE BOURGEOIS. But they probably won’t be successful, much as I would wish the whole gang to get in, on the

      For these people would expose their real politics before their proletarian constituencies, just as (Engels
      continued) Schweitzer had “ruined himself” in the Reichstag.
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="ch05--391">
      A decade later, Engels was still observing new steps forward in this process, always slower than his hopes.
    </div>

    <div class="bq" id="ch05--392">
      … a new period will date from the next elections, even if this does not show itself with all speed. There will be
      workers in Parliament, in growing numbers, and each one will be worse than the other. But that is necessary here
      [in England]. All the scoundrels who played the role of bourgeois-radical philistines here in the International’s
      day must show themselves in Parliament <a id="page_142" class="calibre6"></a>just as they are. Then the masses will become
      socialist here too. Industrial overproduction will do the rest.<sup id="ch05--394" class="calibre13"><a id="ch05fn63" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch05--396" href="39_split_000.html#ch05fn63-r">63</a></sup>

    <div class="noindent" id="ch05--397">
      In fact it took more than three decades for events to approximate this rough scenario. But in another decade,
      things were at least on the move. The form of “direct representation” (trade-union campaigns for trade-union
      candidates) was putting more and more workers into Parliament. Engels hailed the fact that there was increasing
      support for direct representation from, for example, the textile workers:
    </div>

    <div class="bq" id="ch05--398">
      … and a Manchester labor newspaper calculated that the Lancashire textile workers might control twelve seats in
      Parliament in this county alone. As you see, it is the trade union that will enter Parliament. It is the branch
      of industry and not the class that [as yet] demands representation. Still, it is a step forward. Let us first
      smash the enslavement of the workers to the big bourgeois parties; let us have textile workers in Parliament just
      as we already have miners there. As soon as a dozen branches of industry are represented, class-consciousness
      will arise of itself.<sup id="ch05--399" class="calibre13"><a id="ch05fn64" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch05--401" href="39_split_000.html#ch05fn64-r">64</a></sup>
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="ch05--402">
      Direct representation was a “step forward” to the establishment of a political party that carried this form to
      its logical conclusion, as the formation of the Labor Party did later. With this background, the organizational
      form of the workers’ party in England became quite different from the German exemplar.
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="ch05--403">
      The English model—a workers’ party based on the organizational structure of the trade unions—was also probably
      expected by Marx in that other country where unionization had preceded a mass socialist organization: the United
      States. Interviewed by an American newspaperman, Marx was quoted as saying: “Upon Trades-Unions, in many
      countries, have been built political organizations. In America the need of an independent Workingmen’s party has
      been made manifest. They can no longer trust politicians …”<sup id="ch05--404" class="calibre13"><a id="ch05fn65" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch05--406" href="39_split_000.html#ch05fn65-r">65</a></sup> This statement is in line with other indications
      of Marx’s views, as well as Engels’; it is acknowledgment of a possibility, one that would be welcomed, but not
      prescribed. The road to a workers’ party by <em id="ch05--407" class="calibre8">structurally</em> founding it on the organized
      trade-union movement was one alternative, but only one, under given historical circumstances. That was as far as
      Marx was concerned to press the issue.

    <h3 class="h2" id="ch05lev7"><a id="page_143" class="calibre15"></a>7. “REVOLUTIONARY UNIONISM” AND SYNDICALISM</h3>

    <div class="indent" id="ch05--410">
      Marx’s conception of the place of trade unions in the class struggle makes it clear that he gave short shrift to
      the notion of “revolutionary trade unions” as an ultimatistic demand. The subject requires some comment only
      because of later developments.
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="ch05--411">
      This notion has already come up in two connections. Although we have emphasized the Lassalleans’ taste for
      party-controlled unions, it will come as no surprise to learn that the Lassalleans themselves put the matter in
      other terms: they wanted to ensure the socialist character and ideological purity of the trade unions. Party
      domination was the means of enforcing this revolutionary requirement. The case of the Socialist Labor Party in
      the United States was similar, even though these American Lassalleans (often called Marxists) did not have as big
      a movement to operate on as their German congeners did.
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="ch05--412">
      In both these cases, and in many others to come, Marx’s view of the trade union as the elementary organ of class
      struggle was rejected in favor of the traditional ultimatum of the sect: <em id="ch05--413" class="calibre8">If you workers do not
      adopt the Only True Faith</em>, <em id="ch05--414" class="calibre8">we hereby read you out of the proletariat.</em>
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="ch05--415">
      Such theories of “revolutionary unionism” leave no room for the existence of autonomous arms of the class; one
      must pre-empt the others. If the Lassalleans saw a role only for the political party, this exclusiveness
      suggested its own mirror image, which came to be called syndicalism.<a id="ch05en7-r" class="calibre6"></a><a class="nounder1" id="ch05--417" href="43.html#ch05en7">*</a> The trade union is substituted for the political party as the overall
      organizer of workers’ power and the future society. The trade union, in effect, takes on all political roles
      (while rejecting the term <em id="ch05--418" class="calibre8">political</em> as inapplicable). The trade union, therefore, becomes
      the revolutionary vanguard, that is, an advanced portion of the class, and is no longer the elementary and broad
      organizer of workers as yet unclassconscious. From Marx’s standpoint, when the trade union takes the place of
      political organization, nothing takes the place of the trade union, whose role in the class struggle is left a
      vacuum.
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="ch05--419">
      This fatally narrowed conception of trade-unionism existed only in embryonic form in Marx’s time; it cropped up
      only sporadically in the <a id="page_144" class="calibre6"></a>International. Impetus to ideas of this sort came especially out of
      the Proudhonist antipathy to political action perse; such antipoliticism lay behind some disputes in the
      movement.
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="ch05--421">
      A primitive expression of this notion came up at the 1868 Brussels congress of the International in connection
      with the war question on the agenda; the answer proposed was a general strike as the reply to a declaration of
      war. Since “it would suffice for the working men to strike work to render war impossible,” the resolution
      recommended that the workers “cease work in case a war be declared in their country.” This resolution, pushed by
      the Belgian delegates and supported by the French, was actually adopted.<sup id="ch05--422" class="calibre13"><a id="ch05fn66" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch05--424" href="39_split_000.html#ch05fn66-r">66</a></sup> Marx was apparently
      unaware of its adoption when he read about the proposal in Eccarius’ <em id="ch05--425" class="calibre8">Times</em> report of the
      congress; he wrote Engels that Eccarius “ascribed to the Germans and English the Belgian nonsense, °to <em id="ch05--426" class="calibre8">strike against war</em>,°”<sup id="ch05--427" class="calibre13"><a id="ch05fn67" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch05--429" href="39_split_000.html#ch05fn67-r">67</a></sup> (The German delegates had proposed a different resolution, and it is not
      clear from the minutes how the Belgian version came to be adopted, since this seems to have taken place at an
      administrative session.)<sup id="ch05--430" class="calibre13"><a id="ch05fn68" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch05--432" href="39_split_000.html#ch05fn68-r">68</a></sup>
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="ch05--433">
      The proposal was “nonsense” to Marx because such a general strike could only precipitate an all-out confrontation
      with the state power for control over society—commonly called a revolution. The Belgian resolution, therefore,
      was not about a very big strike but was a modest proposal that a revolution should be proclaimed by resolution.
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="ch05--434">
      In early 1869 the Belgian leader De Paepe reformulated his Proudhonist conceptions into what we can now recognize
      to be a definitely syndicalist proposal: the future social order, he argued, must be based on the International’s
      own institutions, especially trade unions. He put these ideas forward at the Basel Congress; they were echoed by
      the Swiss and Spanish Bakuninists; and in Geneva, even J. P. Becker, a friend of Marx’s with congenitally
      unstable politics, began to repeat the talk about substituting trade unions for political organization. Engels
      wrote wonderingly to Marx:
    </div>

    <div class="bqi" id="ch05--435">
      Old Becker must have gone clean out of his head. How can he decree that the °Trades Union° <em id="ch05--436" class="calibre8">has</em> to be the real workers’ association and basis of all organization, and that the other forms
      of organization <em id="ch05--437" class="calibre8">have</em> to remain only provisional alongside it, etc. All this in a country
      where proper trades unions° still don’t even exist. And what a complicated “organization.”<sup id="ch05--438" class="calibre13"><a id="ch05fn69" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch05--440" href="39_split_000.html#ch05fn69-r">69</a></sup>
    </div>

    <div class="noindent" id="ch05--441">
      <a id="page_145" class="calibre6"></a>In fact, syndicalist notions often flourished where “proper trade unions” had not yet
      developed, that is, where the concept of the trade union was not yet that of a real class organization but mostly
      a theoretical construct. It is clear that Marx and Engels dismissed out of hand such ideas as Becker had started
      to develop. In 1870, assuming that these ideas were emanating from Bakuninist circles, Marx, writing to a friend,
      pointed to them as one example of the poverty of Bakunin’s “theoretical baggage.” According to this view, he
      wrote, °°“The working class must not occupy itself with <em id="ch05--443" class="calibre8">politics.</em> They must only organise
      themselves by trades-unions. One fine day, by means of the <em id="ch05--444" class="calibre8">Internationale</em> they will
      supplant the place of all existing states. You see what a caricature he has made of my doctrines!”<sup id="ch05--445" class="calibre13"><a id="ch05fn69a" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch05--447" href="39_split_000.html#ch05fn69a-r">69a</a></sup> At
      this point Marx plainly did not think the notion needed refutation.<a id="ch05en8-r" class="calibre6"></a><a class="nounder1" id="ch05--449" href="43.html#ch05en8">*</a>
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="ch05--450">
      At the International’s London Conference of 1871, similar ideas came out of a murky discussion of the proposal by
      French delegate Delahaye to favor the formation of international federations of trade unions which would be,
      inter alia, models of “the real commune of the future.”<sup id="ch05--451" class="calibre13"><a id="ch05fn70" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch05--453" href="39_split_000.html#ch05fn70-r">70</a></sup> In the ensuing discussion Marx and Engels both
      summarized reasons why the trade unions are necessarily limited in their tasks and possibilities, and especially
      stressed that even in England the trade unions had not organized most workers. We have cited some of their
      remarks in another context.<sup id="ch05--454" class="calibre13"><a id="ch05fn71" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch05--456" href="39_split_000.html#ch05fn71-r">71</a></sup> On this question their purpose was to explain why it was not the trade unions
      that could be viewed as the structural basis of socialist society; in this connection the scant minutes record
      only the following:
    </div>

    <div class="alpha-list" id="ch05--457">
      He [Marx] denies that it is the commune of the future because [this] project rests on the division of labor,
      principal cause of the slavery of the workers. It may ameliorate the lot of the workers a little, but it cannot
      be offered as an ideal.<sup id="ch05--458" class="calibre13"><a id="ch05fn72" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch05--460" href="39_split_000.html#ch05fn72-r">72</a></sup>
    </div>

    <div class="noindentt" id="ch05--461">
      Objections from other delegates pointed out that the adoption of the Delahaye scheme would leave no reason for
      existence for the International itself, as for any political movement. The Delahaye resolution was defeated.
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="ch05--462">
      The substance of the syndicalist idea was encountered from an <a id="page_146" class="calibre6"></a>unexpected source a few years
      later: Professor Dühring, who wanted to found a school of socialism of his own, made it an accusation against
      socialists in general. In <em id="ch05--464" class="calibre8">Anti-Dühring</em> Engels quotes Dühring’s statement that the
      conception of “collective ownership” is unclear because “this conception of the future always gives the
      impression that it means nothing more than corporative ownership by groups of workers.” Engels dismisses this as
      simply a baseless falsehood.<sup id="ch05--465" class="calibre13"><a id="ch05fn73" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch05--467" href="39_split_000.html#ch05fn73-r">73</a></sup>
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="ch05--468">
      That Dühring had plucked the notion out of the air at all showed that it was floating around. A caution is
      necessary. Because of the later association of syndicalism with anarchism, violence, revolutionary phrases, and
      so on, it has a literary aura of revolutionism about it; but this should not be antedated. During the years we
      are concerned with, radical views that sought to replace political action with trade-union organization were more
      than likely to be reformist-oriented, a flight from the revolutionary task of directly confronting state power.
      (In fact, this also conditions the later history of syndicalism, but that is another story.)
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="ch05--469">
      Thus, against various socialist alternatives, Marx had to make clear his own distinctive view of the relationship
      between the economic movement of the trade unions and the political movement of a party or party-like
      organization. Trade unions were training grounds of the class, as well as its first line of defense, but the goal
      of the training was still a political and social revolution.
