<div class="indent2" id="ch13--2">
      The preceding chapter has sufficiently emphasized the negative features of the peasantry, from the standpoint of
      Marx’s hopes for revolution. But none of this gainsays a proposition that Marx and Engels developed more and more
      as time went on, and which is the subject of this chapter: <em class="calibre19" id="ch13--3">It is essential for the revolutionary
      proletarian movement to do everything possible to win over (at least a part of) the peasantry to its own side;
      and it is possible to make at least considerable gains in this direction, given suitable policies.</em>

      They argued that great success could be attained without in the least going outside the framework of socialist
      principles. There was a special problem of principle we must deal with first.
    </div>
<h3 class="h4" id="ch13lev1">1. A QUESTION OF PRIORITIES</h3>
<div class="indent2" id="ch13--6">
      The special problem was the relation of the peasantry to the rural proletariat.
    </div>
<div class="indent2" id="ch13--7">
      “Which of these [several] subdivisions of the rural population can be won over by the Social-Democratic Party?”
      asks Engels in his main essay on the peasant question.<sup class="calibre20" id="ch13--8"><a class="calibre4" id="ch13fn1"></a><a class="nounder4" href="39_split_000.html#ch13fn1-r" id="ch13--10">1</a></sup> He answers: first and foremost, the rural proletariat. From a
      basic standpoint, the farm worker is the class kin of the industrial proletarian, and more likely than a peasant
      to understand the socialist solution.
    </div>
<div class="bq2" id="ch13--11">
      Of course a workers’ party has to fight, in the first place, on behalf of the wage-workers, that is, for the male
      and female servantry and the day-laborers. It is unquestionably forbidden to make any promises to the peasants
      [in the party program] which include the continuance of the wage-slavery of the workers.<sup class="calibre20" id="ch13--12"><a class="calibre4" id="ch13fn2"></a><a class="nounder4" href="39_split_000.html#ch13fn2-r" id="ch13--14">2</a></sup>

<div class="noindentt1" id="ch13--15">
<a class="calibre4" id="page_359"></a>Later we will discuss the program of immediate and socialist demands directed to the rural
      proletariat, to win them over to the social-revolutionary forces.
    </div>
<div class="indent2" id="ch13--17">
      For Germany particularly, Engels—writing toward the end of his life and near the end of the century—emphasized
      the basic importance of radicalization among the rural workers as the key to overthrowing the political power of
      East German Junkerdom and expropriating their big landed estates: “Here we are confronted by rural proletarians
      in masses and our task is clear.” The prospect is good: “it can be only a question of time, and of only a very
      short time, before we win over to our side the rural workers of Prussia east of the Elbe. But once we have the
      East-Elbe rural workers a different wind will blow at once all over Germany.” The power of Prussian Junkerdom is
      based on these exploited rural proletarian masses; and this power in turn provides the basis for Prussia’s
      overlordship in Germany, and for “the specifically Prussian character” of the bureaucracy and the army officer
      corps. This Prussian stronghold is based not only on farm labor proper, but on labor in the two characteristic
      rural industries, beet-sugar refining and liquor distilling.<sup class="calibre20" id="ch13--18"><a class="calibre4" id="ch13fn3"></a><a class="nounder4" href="39_split_000.html#ch13fn3-r" id="ch13--20">3</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="bq2" id="ch13--21">
      Sow the seed of Social-Democracy among these workers, give them courage and cohesion to insist upon their rights,
      and the glory of the Junkers will be at an end. The great reactionary power, which to Germany represents the same
      barbarous, predatory element as Russian czardom does to the whole of Europe, will collapse like a pricked bubble.
      The “picked regiments” of the Prussian army will become Social-Democratic, which will result in a shift in power
      that is pregnant with an entire upheaval. But for this reason it is of vastly greater importance to win the rural
      proletariat east of the Elbe than the small peasants of Western Germany or yet the middle peasants of Southern
      Germany. It is here, in East-Elbe Prussia, that the decisive battle of our cause will have to be fought…<sup class="calibre20" id="ch13--22"><a class="calibre4" id="ch13fn4"></a><a class="nounder4" href="39_split_000.html#ch13fn4-r" id="ch13--24">4</a></sup>

<div class="noindentt1" id="ch13--25">
      This introduces a consideration which we will elaborate in Volume 3, in connection with the road to political
      power; we stress, in anticipation, that its importance was not only enormous for the future of Germany and of
      Europe but, for present purposes, highlights the concreteness of the problem. The rural proletariat was not a
      Chosen Class in some abstract philosophical way but it was in fact one of the main keys to the coming social
      revolution. “Wherever medium-sized and large estates <a class="calibre4" id="page_360"></a>prevail,” as in northern and eastern
      Germany, farm laborers become a numerous class, “and it is <em class="calibre19" id="ch13--27">there</em> that the industrial
      workers of the towns find their <em class="calibre19" id="ch13--28">most numerous and most natural allies.</em>”<sup class="calibre20" id="ch13--29"><a class="calibre4" id="ch13fn5"></a><a class="nounder4" href="39_split_000.html#ch13fn5-r" id="ch13--31">5</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="indent2" id="ch13--32">
      This was also the easiest case for socialist policy. But this fact does not mean that the rural proletariat is as
      easily radicalized as urban workers. Even apart from the cultural conditions under which they live, agricultural
      workers tend to be more dependent on their employers than industrial workers, hence harder to organize. Engels
      had noted such difficulties already in his <em class="calibre19" id="ch13--33">Condition of the Working Class in England</em>,
      together with some forces making for change.<sup class="calibre20" id="ch13--34"><a class="calibre4" id="ch13fn6"></a><a class="nounder4" href="39_split_000.html#ch13fn6-r" id="ch13--36">6</a></sup> More than once Marx or Engels took occasion to signalize the
      outbreak of strikes among farm workers, as class struggles of special significance. In a <em class="calibre19" id="ch13--37">New
      York Tribune</em> article of 1853 Marx called special attention to “a fact which deserves more notice,” namely “a
      regular strike amongst agricultural laborers [in England], a thing that has never taken place before.”<sup class="calibre20" id="ch13--38"><a class="calibre4" id="ch13fn7"></a><a class="nounder4" href="39_split_000.html#ch13fn7-r" id="ch13--40">7</a></sup> In 1869 he
      stressed that one of the important factors in the Irish movement was “the coming out of the °agricultural
      labouring class° against the °farming class°”—the latter class comprising mainly big landowners.<sup class="calibre20" id="ch13--41"><a class="calibre4" id="ch13fn8"></a><a class="nounder4" href="39_split_000.html#ch13fn8-r" id="ch13--43">8</a></sup> When in 1872
      Engels started contributing “Letters from London” to the Italian socialist press, his first article hailed the
      strike movement of English farm workers and their advancing organization: “The farm workers’ union became for the
      terrified landowners and tenant farmers what the International is for the reactionary governments of Europe—a
      bogy the very name of which sets them quaking.” Since the movement had successes, Engels became
      characteristically enthusiastic: “This first great victory marks the beginning of a new era in the intellectual
      and social life of the rural proletariat, which has joined <em class="calibre19" id="ch13--44">en masse</em> the movement of the
      town proletarians against the tyranny of capital.”<sup class="calibre20" id="ch13--45"><a class="calibre4" id="ch13fn9"></a><a class="nounder4" href="39_split_000.html#ch13fn9-r" id="ch13--47">9</a></sup> In Germany the prospects were naturally less good:
    </div>
<div class="bq2" id="ch13--48">
      The agricultural proletariat [wrote Engels in 1865] is that section of the working class which is clarified as to
      its own interests and its own social situation with the most difficulty and last of all; in other words, that
      section which longest remains an instrument, without consciousness of itself, in the hands of the privileged
      class that exploits it [the landed aristocracy]…. The fight against the feudal and bureaucratic reaction—for both
      are now inseparable in our country—is in Germany equivalent to the <a class="calibre4" id="page_361"></a>struggle for the mental
      and political emancipation of the rural proletariat; and as long as the rural proletariat has not been drawn into
      the movement, the urban proletariat in Germany cannot and will not accomplish the least bit…<sup class="calibre20" id="ch13--50"><a class="calibre4" id="ch13fn10"></a><a class="nounder4" href="39_split_000.html#ch13fn10-r" id="ch13--52">10</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="indentt1" id="ch13--53">
      We see that the crucial importance of the rural proletariat was not an opinion that Engels came to only late in
      life. Marx too had understood the role of this sector even before writing the Manifesto. In an 1847 article, he
      had made the point in a contrast between the Galician peasant (taken as an example) and the English agricultural
      day-laborer: the former sees the “property question” only as “the transformation of feudal landed property into
      small bourgeois landed property,” just like the pre-1789 French peasant; but the latter has to deal with the
      English farmer, that is, with an “industrial capitalist who carries on agriculture like a factory.” As a result,
      he thought, “The abolition of capital… is the property question as understood by the English agricultural
      day-laborer just as well as by the English factory worker.”<sup class="calibre20" id="ch13--54"><a class="calibre4" id="ch13fn11"></a><a class="nounder4" href="39_split_000.html#ch13fn11-r" id="ch13--56">11</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="indent2" id="ch13--57">
      Among the peasantry itself, of course, socialist hopes and expectations center on the small peasant.
    </div>
<div class="bq2" id="ch13--58">
      Not only is he, of all peasants, the most important for Western Europe in general, but he is also the critical
      case that decides the entire question. Once we have clarified in our minds our attitude to the small peasant we
      have all the data needed to determine our stand relative to the other constituent parts of the rural
      population.<sup class="calibre20" id="ch13--59"><a class="calibre4" id="ch13fn12"></a><a class="nounder4" href="39_split_000.html#ch13fn12-r" id="ch13--61">12</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="noindentt1" id="ch13--62">
      We will see below how this is to be implemented.
    </div>
<div class="indent2" id="ch13--63">
      If we consider the following list of social strata on the land, in which the categories <em class="calibre19" id="ch13--64">big,
      middle, small</em> also include tenant farmers:

<div class="numlist" id="ch13--65">

      5. Rural proletariat
    </div>
<div class="noindent1" id="ch13--70">
      Marx and Engels would draw the main line of social struggle between 3 and 4, expecting it to float up through 3
      according to concrete circumstances. Below the line there was a strict rule of priority: the interests of the
      rural proletariat take precedence.
    </div>
<div class="indent2" id="ch13--71">
      Socialists must keep in mind, remarked Engels in a letter to Marx, that there are various kinds of peasant
      property-owners in Germany:
    </div>
<div class="bq2" id="ch13--72">
<a class="calibre4" id="page_362"></a>in the first place the big peasant, against whose reactionary nature the day-laborer and
      farm-hand must be incited; in the second place, the middle peasant, who will also be reactionary and is not very
      numerous; and in the third place, the debt-laden small peasant, who can be interested by tackling the mortgage
      problem.<sup class="calibre20" id="ch13--74"><a class="calibre4" id="ch13fn13"></a><a class="nounder4" href="39_split_000.html#ch13fn13-r" id="ch13--76">13</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="noindentt1" id="ch13--77">
      In answer to an inquiry from Italy, Engels formulated the idea on behalf of the General Council of the
      International:
    </div>
<div class="bq2" id="ch13--78">
      Our policy with regard to the agricultural population has naturally been in general as follows: Where there are
      extensive estates, there the tenant farmer is the capitalist with respect to the [farm] laborer, and there we
      must side with the laborer. Next, where there are small farms, although the tenant farmer may nominally be a
      small capitalist or landowner (as in France and part of Germany), yet in reality he is generally reduced to the
      same state of poverty as the proletarian, and so we must work for him. No doubt it is the same in Italy.<sup class="calibre20" id="ch13--79"><a class="calibre4" id="ch13fn14"></a><a class="nounder4" href="39_split_000.html#ch13fn14-r" id="ch13--81">14</a></sup>

<div class="noindentt1" id="ch13--82">
      Above all, it would be “a direct violation … of the fundamental principle of socialism in general” to support the

      This principle set boundaries within which the peasant question could be considered.
    </div>
<h3 class="h4" id="ch13lev2">2. NO AUTOMATIC FORMULAS</h3>
<div class="indent2" id="ch13--89">
      Engels had no inkling of the marxological future when he wrote in 1873, in the course of a controversy on the
      housing question:. “I need hardly defend myself against Mülberger’s suggestion that I fail to appreciate the
      necessity of drawing the peasants into the movement.”<sup class="calibre20" id="ch13--90"><a class="calibre4" id="ch13fn16"></a><a class="nounder4" href="39_split_000.html#ch13fn16-r" id="ch13--92">16</a></sup> The present chapter shows the extent to which he and Marx
      were concerned to bring this about. But we may make some general observations in advance.
    </div>
<div class="indent2" id="ch13--93">
      For one thing, we will not find Marx or Engels changing their tune about the negative features of the peasantry
      and its limited potentialities; their concern with the positive side did not mean fostering illusions or tickling
      peasant champions under the chin. Anything that might happen was likely to develop slowly; for, as Engels
      observed, “a peasant <a class="calibre4" id="page_363"></a>people has to be swindled for a century-long before it learns by
      experience.”<sup class="calibre20" id="ch13--95"><a class="calibre4" id="ch13fn17"></a><a class="nounder4" href="39_split_000.html#ch13fn17-r" id="ch13--97">17</a></sup> Even in his very positive 1894 thesis, Engels’ claims were moderate. “The
      peasant has so far largely manifested himself as a factor of political power only by his apathy, which has its
      roots in the isolation of rustic life,” he summed up; but he was looking forward: this apathy “is by no means
      insuperable.”<sup class="calibre20" id="ch13--98"><a class="calibre4" id="ch13fn18"></a><a class="nounder4" href="39_split_000.html#ch13fn18-r" id="ch13--100">18</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="indent2" id="ch13--101">
      Secondly: much of their attention concentrated on the French and German peasantry, but we shall see that they had
      no iron formulas for political policy automatically applying to any peasantry in the world. Their conclusions had
      to vary considerably depending on the actual socioeconomic and political position of a given peasantry under
      concrete circumstances. Taken on an international scale, the peasantry lived under different social systems: at
      least three—capitalism, feudalism, and the “Asiatic” mode of production. Put somewhat more precisely, they lived
      under socioeconomic conditions in which features of one or more of these systems were unevenly combined to
      various degrees.
    </div>
<div class="indent2" id="ch13--102">
      Therefore, different countries—different cases. A major difference was the stage or degree of bourgeoisification.
      Even within Western Europe there was a wide spectrum confronting Marx. At one end was Britain, where “big landed
      estates and large-scale agriculture have totally displaced the self-supporting peasant.” There was virtually no
      peasant question (although there were agricultural problems). The next country, France, already showed a
      different visage; for known historical reasons, it combined a relatively advanced bourgeoisification with the
      overriding weight of a peasant population, without a large noncapitalist ruling class on the land. This last
      element did exist in Germany, particularly in the Prussian east, together with a weaker bourgeoisie. Still, these
      countries were already pell-mell on the road to capitalist development. Italy was far behind; and then there were
      retarded countries like Ireland and Spain, which could not be forgotten. “From Ireland to Sicily, from Andalusia
      to Russia and Bulgaria, the peasant is a very essential factor of the population, production and political
      power.”<sup class="calibre20" id="ch13--103"><a class="calibre4" id="ch13fn19"></a><a class="nounder4" href="39_split_000.html#ch13fn19-r" id="ch13--105">19</a></sup> And besides there were great variations inside most of these countries.
    </div>
<div class="indent2" id="ch13--106">
      Then the case of semi-Asiatic Russia begins to move out of the European framework, as does Turkey. Beyond are the
      cases of India and China, and nothing less than the rest of the world, some countries nearly untouched by
      internal capitalist development and many still <a class="calibre4" id="page_364"></a>without even a weak proletariat. At the other
      end of the spectrum, even the capitalistically developed United States was a special case because of the
      availability of new land for small farmsteads and rural enterprises.
    </div>
<div class="indent2" id="ch13--108">
      In his 1894 article, which dealt with France and Germany, Engels called attention to the internal variations for
      Germany alone. He begins, “The rural population to which we can address ourselves consists of quite different
      parts, which vary greatly with the various regions,” and he ends with a qualification: “We, of course,
      investigate this question only in broad outline; we single out only clear-cut forms. We lack space to give
      consideration to intermediate stages and mixed rural populations.”<sup class="calibre20" id="ch13--109"><a class="calibre4" id="ch13fn20"></a><a class="nounder4" href="39_split_000.html#ch13fn20-r" id="ch13--111">20</a></sup> This reminder applies
      also to this chapter.
    </div>
<h3 class="h4" id="ch13lev3">3. PRELUDE TO REVOLUTION</h3>
<div class="indent2" id="ch13--113">
      Marx and Engels developed their programmatic views on the peasant question in response mainly to experience,
      especially the experience of revolution in 1848-1849.
    </div>
<div class="indent2" id="ch13--114">
      In the case of Marx there is no indication of a particular interest in the question from 1843 to 1848, that is,
      between his departure from Germany and the outbreak of the revolution. Engels (as described in <a class="nounder4" href="15.html#ch07" id="ch13--115">Chapter 7</a>) began at least by 1847 to advocate a revolutionary bloc of the
      proletariat with the peasantry and petty-bourgeoisie in anticipation of the coming upsurge. Let us recall too,
      without going over this ground again, that the <em class="calibre19" id="ch13--116">Communist Manifesto</em>, in the final form
      given by Marx, took a very negative view of the peasantry, as of the petty-bourgeoisie. The existence of a
      specific peasant question was not even mentioned. To be sure, the Manifesto’s ten-point program does have four
      points on agriculture (1, 7, 8, 9) but only from the standpoint of the aims and needs of a workers’ government.
      In addition, points 3 and 5 would be of special interest to peasants; but 3 would dismay them, and 5 is stated
      without relevance to the peasants’ problem of usury. In fact, in the telescopic lens of the Manifesto the
      continuing existence of the peasantry is barely recognized. It is viewed in passing mentions as a thing of the
      past or rapidly getting there, or of no evident interest if still vegetating in the present. About the only
      passage in which it is not part of a list or mentioned in association with the petty-bourgeoisie is the <a class="calibre4" id="page_365"></a>one about “the <em class="calibre19" id="ch13--118">Idiotismus</em> of rural life,” which alludes to peasants only
      by implication. In Part IV, on current politics, the peasantry is not mentioned at all, even when the Polish
      party of agrarian revolution is listed.<sup class="calibre20" id="ch13--119"><a class="calibre4" id="ch13fn21"></a><a class="nounder4" href="39_split_000.html#ch13fn21-r" id="ch13--121">21</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="indent2" id="ch13--122">
      On the eve of the revolution, Engels, in Paris, was talking about collaboration to Flocon, Ledru-Rollin’s partner
      in the radical movement around <em class="calibre19" id="ch13--123">La Reforme</em>, for which Engels had written articles from
      London. It was January 1848; the Manifesto was not yet off the press. Engels informed Flocon that “we had now
      decided in London to come out publicly as Communists.” Flocon’s response to communism, reported Engels in a
      letter, was: “you tend to despotism, you will kill the revolution in France, we have eleven million small
      peasants who are likewise the fiercest property-owners,” and so on. Then he cursed the peasants for their
      political backwardness, and agreed to political cooperation.<sup class="calibre20" id="ch13--124"><a class="calibre4" id="ch13fn22"></a><a class="nounder4" href="39_split_000.html#ch13fn22-r" id="ch13--126">22</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="indent2" id="ch13--127">
      It was precisely Flocon’s group in power, tied to the petty-bourgeois Democracy, that a few months later found
      itself supporting open despotism in the shape of the Cavaignac dictatorship—and this because it <em class="calibre19" id="ch13--128">subordinated</em> itself to the backwardness of the eleven million peasants who were the fiercest
      property-owners. There was a different course available for revolutionists: reaching out to the peasantry for
      support of communist demands.
    </div>
<div class="indent2" id="ch13--129">
      This was the course taken in March when, with the revolution under way, Marx and Engels drew up “The Demands of
      the Communist Party in Germany.” This document contained the first program of immediate demands on behalf of the
      peasantry that they put forward, comprising points 6 through 9. The demands were: (6) all feudal exactions on the
      rural population to be abolished without compensation; (7) state ownership of all feudal domains and properties;
      (8) mortgages on peasant lands taken over by the state, with interest paid to the state; (9) land rent to be paid
      to the state as a tax. The program also stated:
    </div>
<div class="bq3" id="ch13--130">
      All the measures mentioned under 6, 7, 8 and 9 have been formulated to reduce the public and other burdens on
      peasants and small tenant-farmers, without diminishing the means required to defray state expenses and without
      imperiling production itself.
    </div>
<div class="bqa" id="ch13--131">
      The actual landowner who is neither a peasant nor tenant-farmer has no share in production. Consumption by him is
      therefore nothing but an abuse.
    </div>

      At the end the program directly appealed for the revolutionary alliance: <a class="calibre4" id="page_366"></a>“It is in the
      interests of the German proletariat and of the petty-bourgeoisie and small peasantry to work with all their
      energy to carry through the above measures.”<sup class="calibre20" id="ch13--134"><a class="calibre4" id="ch13fn23"></a><a class="nounder4" href="39_split_000.html#ch13fn23-r" id="ch13--136">23</a></sup>

<div class="indent2" id="ch13--137">
      This was a beginning, though evidently these demands by themselves were not likely to get the small peasantry
      flocking to the Communist banner; for example, nothing was said about rent or interest reduction. On the other
      hand, neither was anything said about land nationalization, and obviously the program assumed the continued
      existence of a peasantry. Point 7 said of the “royal and other feudal domains” that they “shall be cultivated on
      a large scale and with the most up-to-date scientific devices in the interests of the whole of society,” but this
      did not preclude the existence of small-scale farming outside of those domains.

<div class="indent2" id="ch13--138">
      These Demands, however, were drawn up while Marx and Engels were still in Paris, though they looked to Germany.

<div class="indent2" id="ch13--139">
      In France itself, the heavy pressure of the peasantry on the revolution was already clear. While the Demands were
      being written, a letter by Engels summed up his expectation of the antirevolutionary role of the French peasants,
      pessimistically but accurately:

<div class="bq3" id="ch13--140">

      bourgeoisie]. It is very probable that this party will win out, and that the people from <em class="calibre19" id="ch13--142">La

      But in eastern Germany, where Napoleon’s antifeudal influence had not penetrated, the peasants broke out in
      revolutionary action to take over the land. In a historical article written several decades later, Engels still
      emphasized it was a revolutionary portent:

      Especially in Silesia, where the system of latifundia and the accompanying depression of the population to the

      settled redemption deeds, and forced the gracious lords to sign written renunciations of all further [feudal]
      services. These excesses—wicked even in the eyes of the then ruling bourgeoisie—were indeed suppressed with

<div class="indent2" id="ch13--155">
      When Marx launched the <em class="calibre19" id="ch13--156">Neue Rheinische Zeitung</em> at the beginning of June, the immediate
      audience was of course urban. Besides, the peasantry of the Rhineland was still far from the revolutionary energy
      of the Silesians. But from the first month the <em class="calibre19" id="ch13--157">N.R.Z.</em> took up the cudgels for the
      embattled peasants.
    </div>
<div class="indent2" id="ch13--158">
      On June 10, Minister Patow published a memorandum purporting to provide for the elimination of feudal rights in
      the countryside, but also revealing how heavy the feudal burden was. This brought the first big blast in the
      <em class="calibre19" id="ch13--159">N.R.Z</em>. on the issue:
    </div>
<div class="bq3" id="ch13--160">
      Reading this memorandum, it is incomprehensible why a peasants’ war has not long since broken out in the
      provinces of old Prussia. …
    </div>
<div class="bqa" id="ch13--161">
      The Berlin revolution [of March] has made all these feudal conditions impossible for the whole future. The
      peasants had immediately abolished them in practice, as was entirely natural. The government had nothing further
      to do than to give legal form <em class="calibre19" id="ch13--162">to the abolition of all feudal burdens already actually carried
      out by the will of the people.</em>
</div>
<div class="bqa" id="ch13--163">
      But before the aristocracy decides on an August 4th [1789 in France: first abolition of feudal rights], their
      castles must first go up in flames.
    </div>
<div class="noindentt1" id="ch13--164">
      Through Patow’s memo, the bourgeois conciliationists of the National Assembly
    </div>
<div class="bq2" id="ch13--165">
      are now likewise invited to betray the peasant revolution, which broke out all over Germany in March, to the
      aristocracy. The government is responsible for the consequences which the application of the Patow principles
      will have on the countryside.<sup class="calibre20" id="ch13--166"><a class="calibre4" id="ch13fn26"></a><a class="nounder4" href="39_split_000.html#ch13fn26-r" id="ch13--168">26</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="noindentt1" id="ch13--169">
      After a stinging analysis of the government proposals, the conclusion was: “The government <em class="calibre19" id="ch13--170">is
      provoking a peasants’ war,”</em> especially in <a class="calibre4" id="page_368"></a>Silesia. This was no doubt a hope and an aim
      rather than a confident prediction.
    </div>
<div class="indent2" id="ch13--172">
      The main peasant issue, then, as adumbrated by point 6 of the Demands, was the compensation or indemnification of
      the landowning aristocracy for the “redemption” of their land by the peasants. Marx and Engels followed this up
      vigorously, emphasizing that feudal rights had already been abolished from below by the revolutionary action of
      the peasants themselves, and these claims should not be restored even partially, under the guise of a law to
      abolish feudal burdens which actually restored part of what the peasants had swept away. So went a major article
      by Marx at the end of July. The government understands that: “It is impossible to bring back the whole of the old
      status quo; the peasants would slaughter their feudal barons without further ado.” Therefore the government hopes
      to quiet the peasants with small concessions, and even thereby gain their votes. It is willing to forbid plucking
      the peasants’ geese but not plucking the peasants themselves.<sup class="calibre20" id="ch13--173"><a class="calibre4" id="ch13fn27"></a><a class="nounder4" href="39_split_000.html#ch13fn27-r" id="ch13--175">27</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="indent2" id="ch13--176">
      This article raised the issue from the agitational level to an insight into the class relations of the
      bourgeoisie with the old rulers. The bourgeois minister is willing to encroach on feudal property rights— hence
      the partial concessions—but not on bourgeois property rights, specifically the bourgeois property rights erected
      on the ruins of feudal property by the redemption procedure, which transmutes feudal claims into cash payments:
    </div>
<div class="bq2" id="ch13--177">
      And it is simply for this reason that he will not revise the redemption agreements, because by these agreements
      the feudal property relations have been transformed into <em class="calibre19" id="ch13--178">bourgeois</em> property relations,
      because he therefore cannot revise them without formally violating bourgeois property at the same time. And
      bourgeois property is naturally just as sacred and inviolable as feudal property is open to attack and, depending
      on the minister’s need and courage, even violation.<sup class="calibre20" id="ch13--179"><a class="calibre4" id="ch13fn28"></a><a class="nounder4" href="39_split_000.html#ch13fn28-r" id="ch13--181">28</a></sup>

      Marx makes the contrast with the way in which the French Revolution consolidated itself on the peasantry by

      The French bourgeoisie of 1789 did not for a moment leave its allies, the peasants, in the lurch. It knew that
      the basis of its rule was the smashing of feudalism in the countryside, the establishment of a free, landowning

<div class="indentt1" id="ch13--192">
      The next major article on this issue came from Engels in early August. First he demonstrates that, according to
      principles inadvertently laid down by the government itself, it is the landowners who legally owe money to the
      peasants, not vice versa—wages for unpaid labor service. But just as in all other countries
    </div>
<div class="bq2" id="ch13--193">
      the transformation of feudal property into bourgeois property and of feudal power into [the power of] capital is
      always a new and crude defraudment of the bondsman for the benefit of the feudal lords. The bondsman must always
      <em class="calibre19" id="ch13--194">buy</em> his freedom, buy it dearly. The bourgeois state proceeds according to the principle:
      The only thing you get free is death.<sup class="calibre20" id="ch13--195"><a class="calibre4" id="ch13fn33"></a><a class="nounder4" href="39_split_000.html#ch13fn33-r" id="ch13--197">33</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="noindentt1" id="ch13--198">
      Moreover, the redemption system will have a lasting economic effect of great importance. On the government’s
      basis, it is mainly the bigger peasants who can buy themselves off, by giving up a parcel of their land. But the
      small peasant, who cannot do this, must borrow:
    </div>
<div class="bq3" id="ch13--199">
      The necessary consequence of these enormous exactions from the peasants is … that they fall into the hands of the
      usurers. Usury is the necessary companion of a <em class="calibre19" id="ch13--200">free</em> small-peasant class, as France, the
      Palatinate and the Rhineland show. The Prussian science of redemption has made it possible for the small peasants
      of the old province [of Prussia] to enjoy the burden of usury even before they are free. The Prussian government
      has in general understood from way back how to subject the oppressed classes simultaneously to the burden of
      feudal as well as modern bourgeois conditions, and thus make their yoke doubly heavy.<sup class="calibre20" id="ch13--201"><a class="calibre4" id="ch13fn34"></a><a class="nounder4" href="39_split_000.html#ch13fn34-r" id="ch13--203">34</a></sup>

      We may add, briefly, that the <em class="calibre19" id="ch13--205">N.R.Z.</em> raised other peasant issues as they came up. For
      example, on July 26 an article by Engels exposed the way in which the regional estates-assembly setup kept
      control in the hands of the landowners, giving little representation even to the bigger <a class="calibre4" id="page_370"></a>peasants.<sup class="calibre20" id="ch13--207"><a class="calibre4" id="ch13fn35"></a><a class="nounder4" href="39_split_000.html#ch13fn35-r" id="ch13--209">35</a></sup> On August 6 he highlighted the way peasants were treated by the agricultural

<h3 class="h4" id="ch13lev5">5. THE <em class="calibre19" id="ch13--214">N.R.Z.</em> GOES TO THE PEASANTS</h3>
<div class="indent2" id="ch13--215">
      The group around the <em class="calibre19" id="ch13--216">N.R.Z.</em> was not only a revolutionary political center but also an
      organizing center when possible. Since the Communist League had been put on the shelf, the <em class="calibre19" id="ch13--217">N.R.Z.</em> group was a loose operation, organizationally speaking. Its political leader was, of
      course, Marx, both publicly as editor of the paper and as the left-wing leader inside the Democratic Association
      movement. The leading activist of the “Marx party” (as its enemies called it) in the Workers Association was Karl
      Schapper.
    </div>
<div class="indent2" id="ch13--218">
      Indication that a crossroads had been reached came by September with the growing crisis of the government and the
      rise of discontent among the people. The <em class="calibre19" id="ch13--219">N.R.Z</em>. group swung into a new initiative: at a
      mass meeting in Cologne under its leadership, a “Committee of Public Safety” was set up as an embryonic dual
      power, the name recalling the French Revolution.<sup class="calibre20" id="ch13--220"><a class="calibre4" id="ch13fn37"></a><a class="nounder4" href="39_split_000.html#ch13fn37-r" id="ch13--222">37</a></sup> But Cologne was also a Prussian fortress and a troop
      concentration point; in a decisive confrontation the town would not be a sufficient base. The movement had to be
      extended to the countryside not merely journalistically but organizationally.
    </div>
<div class="indent2" id="ch13--223">
      The turn toward practical work on the agrarian question began in August, with the Workers Association as the main
      lever, and with the “Demands of the Communist Party of Germany” as the program.<sup class="calibre20" id="ch13--224"><a class="calibre4" id="ch13fn38"></a><a class="nounder4" href="39_split_000.html#ch13fn38-r" id="ch13--226">38</a></sup> The Democratic

      The Democratic Association was useful in a preparatory role. A <a class="calibre4" id="page_371"></a>Rhineland regional conference
      on August 13-14 was persuaded to recommend that antigovernment propaganda be started in the rural areas, by
      sending organizers, holding meetings, and founding groups, because (said the conference) the peasantry had been
      radicalized by the issues of taxation, the feudal burdens, and bureaucratic harassment. “The major proposal of
      the Congress calling for the exploitation of agrarian and peasant unrest,” says Hammen, “certainly was
      Marxian-inspired.”<sup class="calibre20" id="ch13--231"><a class="calibre4" id="ch13fn40"></a><a class="nounder4" href="39_split_000.html#ch13fn40-r" id="ch13--233">40</a></sup> There certainly was no one else to inspire it.

<div class="indent2" id="ch13--234">
      The decisions on this point were stressed when Moll reported on the conference at the Cologne Workers Association
      on September 3. All the associations, he said, were to “undertake the obligation of making the rounds of the
      countryside in the vicinity, working on the peasants and factory workers, setting up associations in the
      villages, and remaining in regular contact with them.”<sup class="calibre20" id="ch13--235"><a class="calibre4" id="ch13fn41"></a><a class="nounder4" href="39_split_000.html#ch13fn41-r" id="ch13--237">41</a></sup> The Workers Association had already started work before

      On August 27 a delegation from the Cologne association visited the first target, the town of Worringen ten miles

      conditions, a local association of forty members was established. The Cologne organizers returned two weeks later
      to consolidate the branch and prepare for a demonstration. That Sunday, September 10, two Cologne organizers also
      appeared in the village of Wesslingen (or Wesseling) for a meeting with the peasants, who set up a branch
      organization after the burgomaster broke up the meeting by jailing the organizers overnight.<sup class="calibre20" id="ch13--245"><a class="calibre4" id="ch13fn44"></a><a class="nounder4" href="39_split_000.html#ch13fn44-r" id="ch13--247">44</a></sup>

<div class="indent2" id="ch13--248">
      The membership of the Workers Association was actively prepared for the new activities, by educational courses

      the rural area and also in Cologne. The members went over the Demands point by point, in order to be armed with

      Another aim of the internal education of the Association was stress on the importance of peasant work. Its

      preparations to shut down the city gates. But despite hindrance and provocation, the demonstration took place as
      planned. In a meadow along the Rhine, a big speakers’ platform was set up, red flag above, flanked by
      black-red-gold republican banners. About eight to ten thousand attended, in near-unanimous support of the
      speeches for revolution and socialism. The whole affair went through under the open leadership of the <em class="calibre19" id="ch13--274">N.R.Z.</em> group, with Schapper elected chairman and Engels secretary. Delegates from other towns

      On the same day as the Worringen event, a giant rally of many thousands also demonstrated in Frankfurt, the home
      of the Assembly itself, against the timidity and capitulation of the Assembly majority. Treating it as a popular
      uprising, the Imperial Ministry, having no armed force of its own, called in Prussian, Austrian, and Hessian

      Engels’ two articles on the Frankfurt movement are important for the emphasis laid on the role of the nearby

      peasants from countless localities round about.” Of September 19 Engels writes:

      The Frankfurt events provided additional reason for the authorities in Cologne to go into a panic over the

      The formal, and probably the largest part of the actual, motivation for the government’s September attack on the

      On December 20, 1848 [related Engels in a later historical article], it issued a provisional ordinance, whereby
      feudal services <a class="calibre4" id="page_376"></a>were, with only a few exceptions, reinstituted on the old footing, pending
      further adjustments. It was this ordinance that prompted [Wilhelm] Wolff to deal with the situation of the

      Wilhelm Wolff was one of the key members of Marx’s team, the editorial board of the <em class="calibre19" id="ch13--331">N.R.Z.</em> And he was a rare bird indeed: a peasant boy who had achieved an education by enormous
      effort and had become a consistent revolutionary. In a later biographical article, Engels recounted why the

      The hopes of the enserfed peasants of Old [East] Prussia were thereby destroyed; the peasants’ situation had to
      be made clear to them in order to move them to action. And for this Wolff was the man. Not only because he
      himself was by origin an enserfed son of the peasantry and as a child had had to do labor-service on the manor;
      not only because he still fully felt the hatred of the feudal oppressor that such a childhood generated in his
      breast: no one was so well acquainted with the feudal mode of serfdom in all its details as he, and precisely in
      that province which offered a complete catalogue of all its varied forms—Silesia.<sup class="calibre20" id="ch13--333"><a class="calibre4" id="ch13fn60"></a><a class="nounder4" href="39_split_000.html#ch13fn60-r" id="ch13--335">60</a></sup>

      Wolff began writing a number of articles in the <em class="calibre19" id="ch13--337">N.R.Z.</em> dealing with and directed to the
      peasantry. The main theme was the enormous wealth which the landowning aristocracy had sweated out of the
      peasants since their enserfment. An initial article by Marx had brought up the demand being raised by the French
      peasantry for the “return of the billion [francs] “—that is, the recovery of the enormous compensation paid to
      the old landowners after the Bourbon Restoration. Marx then hoped that this issue would radicalize the French
      countryside; it “is the first revolutionary measure,” he wrote optimistically, “that hurls the peasants into the
      revolution.”<sup class="calibre20" id="ch13--338"><a class="calibre4" id="ch13fn61"></a><a class="nounder4" href="39_split_000.html#ch13fn61-r" id="ch13--340">61</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="indent2" id="ch13--341">
      It was this theme, adapted to Germany, that was developed by Wolff in a series of popular articles entitled “The
      Silesian Billion.” According to Hammen, Wolff “wrote most of them, though they unquestionably were prompted by
      Marx who always kept the revolutionary potential of the peasants in mind.”<sup class="calibre20" id="ch13--342"><a class="calibre4" id="ch13fn62"></a><a class="nounder4" href="39_split_000.html#ch13fn62-r" id="ch13--344">62</a></sup> In response to demand, a

<a class="calibre4" id="page_377"></a>Wolff’s close collaboration with Marx and Engels, which had begun in 1846 in Brussels,
      continued till his death in 1864. (He is “Lupus” in the Marx-Engels correspondence.) It was to him that Marx
      dedicated the first volume of <em class="calibre19" id="ch13--352">Capital.</em> After 1849 Wolff settled in Manchester. “For
      several years,” wrote Engels, “Wolff was the sole political cothinker I had in Manchester; no wonder that we saw
      each other almost daily, and that I often had occasion enough to marvel at his almost instinctively correct
      judgment on the events of the day.”<sup class="calibre20" id="ch13--353"><a class="calibre4" id="ch13fn66"></a><a class="nounder4" href="39_split_000.html#ch13fn66-r" id="ch13--355">66</a></sup> The daily influence of this peasant-born revolutionary was no doubt one

      The peasant work of the <em class="calibre19" id="ch13--357">N.R.Z.</em> group in 1848-1849 represented only a beginning. It had no
      sequel since the situation that produced it came to an end with the advance of the counterrevolution in Germany.
      It stands, however, as an acting out of Marx’s and Engels’ first approach to the peasant question as a political
      actuality.
    </div>
<div class="indent2" id="ch13--358">
      Almost a half century later—forty-five years, to be exact—Engels was to write his fullest thesis on the peasant
      question, “The Peasant Question in France and Germany,” from which we have already quoted several times. The
      viewpoint spelled out there is an embodiment of the <em class="calibre19" id="ch13--359">N.R.Z.</em> line: the proletarian
      socialist movement must look to the peasantry for a revolutionary alliance against capitalism, but without
      illusions in the peasantry. This viewpoint is to be distinguished from two other conceptions that were already
      rife and are still dominant today: (1) the conception of the peasantry as the main social force for revolution
      and the primary revolutionary class; and (2) the reformist tendency to neglect the peasantry as any kind of
      revolutionary force.

<div class="indent2" id="ch13--360">
      It is true that the difficulty was not merely the antipeasant views of the urban movements, but also the
      anti-working-class prejudices of the peasants, “prejudices arising out of their entire economic position, their
      upbringing and their isolated mode of life, prejudices nurtured by the bourgeois press and the big
      landowners.”<sup class="calibre20" id="ch13--361"><a class="calibre4" id="ch13fn67"></a><a class="nounder4" href="39_split_000.html#ch13fn67-r" id="ch13--363">67</a></sup>

      Since the rise of the working-class movement in Western Europe, particularly in those parts where small peasant

      the socialist workers suspicious and odious in the minds of the peasants as <em class="calibre19" id="ch13--366">partageux</em>, as

      More than once Engels stressed that even in the developed countries of Western Europe, socialism could not
      succeed against the opposition of the peasantry. “No lasting transformation is possible in France <em class="calibre19" id="ch13--381">against</em> the will of the small peasant,” he wrote.<sup class="calibre20" id="ch13--382"><a class="calibre4" id="ch13fn71"></a><a class="nounder4" href="39_split_000.html#ch13fn71-r" id="ch13--384">71</a></sup> A year before, similarly:
      “even in France the Socialists are realizing more and more that no lasting victory is possible for them, unless
      they first win the great mass of the people, that is, in this case, the peasants.”<sup class="calibre20" id="ch13--385"><a class="calibre4" id="ch13fn72"></a><a class="nounder4" href="39_split_000.html#ch13fn72-r" id="ch13--387">72</a></sup> With this Engels is
      saying two things: if we cannot actually gain the active support of one or another section of the peasantry, it
      is still basically important to neutralize them at least; and even if political power can be conquered against
      the will of the small peasant, it cannot be maintained and a socialist transformation of society will not be
      carried through.

<div class="indent2" id="ch13--388">
      In the period of explosive change between 1849 and 1894, what necessarily changed in Marx’s and Engels’ writings
      on the peasant question was their estimation of what to expect at a given time, in a <a class="calibre4" id="page_379"></a>given
      country, and under given circumstances, just as their expectations of other revolutionary developments changed.
      In the rest of this chapter, we consider their views on different national cases, as they sought to estimate the
      current revolutionary potential of the peasantry within the framework of the possibilities for social revolution.
      How nearly correct their estimate was at any time or place is secondary here; the main point is what their
      approach implied for their conception of the role of a class in revolution.

      After the suppression of the <em class="calibre19" id="ch13--392">Neue Rheinische Zeitung</em> and the end of the “Marx party” in
      Cologne as a political center, there was a last futile aftermath of the German revolution, the armed “campaign
      for the Reich constitution” which saw some fighting in South Germany and the Rhineland in 1849. Marx and Engels
      continued their peasant policy. In Baden they tried—in vain—to get the allegedly revolutionary provisional
      government to win over “the big agricultural majority of the population” by immediately abolishing all feudal
      burdens on the peasantry, by doing what the Frankfurt liberals had refused to do.<sup class="calibre20" id="ch13--393"><a class="calibre4" id="ch13fn73"></a><a class="nounder4" href="39_split_000.html#ch13fn73-r" id="ch13--395">73</a></sup> Though the Baden leftists

      As to country people that joined the insurrection, they were principally thrown into the arms of the
      revolutionary party by the relatively enormous load of taxation, and partly of feudal burdens, pressing upon
      them. Without any initiative of their own, they formed the tail of the other classes engaged in the insurrection,
      wavering between the working men on one side, and the petty trading class [read: petty-bourgeoisie] on the other.
      Their own private social position, in almost every case, decided which <a class="calibre4" id="page_380"></a>way they turned; the

      It was after the failure of this armed campaign that Marx and Engels settled in London. In <a class="nounder4" href="18.html#ch10" id="ch13--407">Chapter 10</a> we have explained the evolution of their views during 1850,
      particularly the period in which they wrote the “Address to the Communist League,” which still assumed that the
      revolution was around the corner, though in a brief lull. Let us now relate the peasant question to this period.
    </div>
<div class="indent2" id="ch13--408">
      As we saw, Marx and Engels emerged from the experience of 1848-1849 with the conviction that the petty-bourgeois
      Democracy would, once in power, become the most dangerous enemy of the real revolution. The revolutionary period
      ahead would unfold in two continuous phases. In phase 1, the revolutionary proletarian party would march against
      the existing ruling classes in alliance with the Democracy; but the joint victory would put the latter in power,
      and it would inevitably betray the aims of the movement and its working-class ally. The working classes must be
      prepared for phase 2, which would pit the consistent revolutionaries against the vacillating and compromising
      Democrats, to make the revolution “permanent.”
    </div>
<div class="indent2" id="ch13--409">
      What lay immediately ahead—as the Address saw it in March 1850—was the period of alliance. The Address is very
      clear that at this point the petty-bourgeois Democracy has the support of both the peasants and the rural
      proletariat—of the rural proletariat “insofar as the latter has not yet found a support in the independent urban
      proletariat.” The peasants, it says, are the allies of the Democracy—allies in the coming revolutionary struggle
      against the government. To be sure, the proletariat is also an ally of the Democracy at this point, but the
      picture has the peasantry under the influence of the urban petty-bourgeois Democratic leaders, not of the
      proletarian left.<sup class="calibre20" id="ch13--410"><a class="calibre4" id="ch13fn76"></a><a class="nounder4" href="39_split_000.html#ch13fn76-r" id="ch13--412">76</a></sup> The great emphasis in the Address is the question of priorities set forth in
      the first section of this chapter: the primacy of the rural proletariat in the agrarian policy of the workers’
      party. The Address expects that the rural proletariat can be won over even before phase 2 opens. Therefore the
      Communists should direct the main appeal of their demands toward the rural proletariat rather than the peasantry,
      <em class="calibre19" id="ch13--413">and make no concessions to the peasants at the expense of the rural laborers.</em>
</div>
<div class="bq2" id="ch13--414">
      As in the first French Revolution, the petty-bourgeois [once in power] will give the feudal lands to the peasants
      as free property, <a class="calibre4" id="page_381"></a>that is to say, try to leave the rural proletariat in existence and form a
      petty-bourgeois peasant class which will go through the same cycle of impoverishment and indebtedness which the

      The workers must oppose this plan in the interest of the rural proletariat and in their own interest. They must
      demand that the confiscated feudal property remain state property and be converted into workers’ colonies
      [cooperatives] cultivated by the associated rural proletariat with all the advantages of large-scale agriculture,
      through which the principle of common property immediately obtains a firm basis in the midst of the tottering
      bourgeois relations. Just as the Democrats combine with the peasants, so must the workers combine with the rural

      It is crucial to understand that the problem raised here is how to dispose of the “confiscated feudal property,”
      the lands of the expropriated aristocracy. There is no question raised about the land presently held by the
      peasantry. The tension that is foreseen is with a peasantry that will want to expand its holdings by taking over
      the domains newly acquired by the revolution. If this happens, then (in addition to certain economic
      consequences) the rural laborers will remain in their present exploited state, still day-laborers working for
      newly enriched peasants. The revolution will have served only to benefit the peasants at the expense of the land
      proletariat. It is against the threat of such an outcome that the Address proposes a different solution: turning
      the new domains over to cooperative associations of the laborers, to be worked as “common property.”

      It goes without saying that it would be easier to win over the peasantry by promising to give them the feudal
      lands as private property, that is, by vying with the Democrats in selling out the interests of the rural
      proletariat. The principle of class priorities means that, where a choice has to be made, Marx chooses the
      interests of the class exploited by peasant employers; and no doubt this choice will be resented especially by
      peasants big enough to be employers of agricultural labor.
    </div>
<div class="indent2" id="ch13--425">
      The line of the Address did not mean giving up the effort to win over the peasantry too; for the revolution had
      something else to offer <a class="calibre4" id="page_382"></a>to the peasants. Only the Communist insistence on carrying the
      revolution through to the end (“in permanence”) would assure them free ownership of their <em class="calibre19" id="ch13--427">present</em> holdings, without indemnification to the nobility and without crushing burdens imposed
      by the government and by the pressure of capital. Those peasants who would support the Democracy against the
      revolution, because of the promise of the feudal lands, would lose all, because the Democrats were incapable of
      carrying through the revolution. Those peasants who supported the Permanent Revolution would do so once they
      realized what the real stakes were. This process of realization and education would be the task of phase 2. In
      the end the revolution could triumph only if decisive sections of the Democracy’s followers could be detached.
      That meant the small peasants above all.

      This summary lays out Marx’s “plan of war,” but of course it was not put to the test, since the expected
      revolutionary resurgence did not materialize. But before Marx came to that conclusion in September, he gave added
      evidence of the importance of the small peasantry to the plan. In June, Marx and Engels wrote a second Address to
      the membership, which indicated some organizational details in addition to the plan outline. In it is a fairly

      During the same summer, Engels was writing his history <em class="calibre19" id="ch13--436">The Peasant War in Germany.</em>
      Although the subject matter went back to the sixteenth century, the work was put into the political framework of
      the present, beginning with an invocation of the recent revolution; “the Peasant War is not entirely far removed
      from our present-day struggle, and the opponents who have to be fought remain essentially the same.” And it ended
      on a similar note: “The bulk of the nation—petty burghers, owners of workshops (artisans), and the peasants—were
      left in the lurch by its currently natural allies, the bourgeoisie, because it was too revolutionary, and partly
      by the proletariat, because it was not sufficiently advanced.”<sup class="calibre20" id="ch13--437"><a class="calibre4" id="ch13fn79"></a><a class="nounder4" href="39_split_000.html#ch13fn79-r" id="ch13--439">79</a></sup> The lesson was clear: today the peasants must not

      Marx put this thought into the modern context in 1856, in a letter to Engels, after a discussion of revolutionary

      The relevance of the Peasant War to the revolution of 1848, and more generally to the modern revolution, came up
      again when Lassalle published his verse drama <em class="calibre19" id="ch13--448">Franz von Sickingen</em> in 1859. Where Engels’
      hero had been Thomas Münzer, Lassalle’s was the leader of the knightly class of the time—the class that was
      hostile to the regime but incapable of making common cause with the revolting peasants, whose labor they lived on
      too. In separate letters to Lassalle, Marx and Engels gave their criticism as requested. Both pointed out the
      political meaning of leaving the peasants’ struggle and Münzer’s plebeian revolt out of the picture, especially
      since Sickingen’s dilemma (as Marx wrote) represented “really the tragic collision that spelled the doom, and
      properly so, of <a class="calibre4" id="page_384"></a>the revolutionary party of 1848-1849”<sup class="calibre20" id="ch13--450"><a class="calibre4" id="ch13fn83"></a><a class="nounder4" href="39_split_000.html#ch13fn83-r" id="ch13--452">83</a></sup>—that is, of the bourgeois
      Democracy which could not make common cause with the oppressed classes in those years. Lassalle’s omission misses
      “the <em class="calibre19" id="ch13--453">really</em> tragic element in Sickingen’s fate,” wrote Engels:
    </div>
<div class="bq2" id="ch13--454">
      As I see it, the mass of the nobility directly subject at that time to the emperor had no intention of concluding
      an alliance with the peasantry. The dependence of their income on the oppressing of the latter did not permit
      this. An alliance with the cities would have been more feasible. But no such alliance was effected, or was
      effected only to a very limited extent. But a national revolution of the nobility could have been accomplished
      only by means of an alliance with the townsmen and the peasants, particularly the latter…. Here, I dare say, lay
      the tragic collision between the historically necessary postulate and the practically impossible
      execution.<sup class="calibre20" id="ch13--455"><a class="calibre4" id="ch13fn84"></a><a class="nounder4" href="39_split_000.html#ch13fn84-r" id="ch13--457">84</a></sup>

<div class="noindentt1" id="ch13--458">
      It is no exaggeration to say, though it would be digressive to show, that most of Lassalleanism is dramatized in
      the obvious elitism of <em class="calibre19" id="ch13--459">Franz von Sickingen.</em> It certainly embodies the reformist pattern
      of viewing the peasantry as a negligible quantity (except as voting cattle); and it goes along with the
      Lassallean “one reactionary mass” theory which Marx attacked.<sup class="calibre20" id="ch13--460"><a class="calibre4" id="ch13fn85"></a><a class="nounder4" href="39_split_000.html#ch13fn85-r" id="ch13--462">85</a></sup> Because of Lassalle’s orientation toward an
      alliance with the aristocracy against the bourgeoisie, he also closed off the possibility of alliance with the
      peasantry, for reasons more modern than motivated the disaffected knights of the sixteenth century. Engels
      remarked acidly: “in a predominantly agricultural country like Prussia it is a vile thing to jump on the
      bourgeoisie exclusively, in the name of the industrial proletariat, but at the same time not mention with so much
      as a word the patriarchal exploitation of the rural proletariat under the whip of the big feudal
      aristocracy.”<sup class="calibre20" id="ch13--463"><a class="calibre4" id="ch13fn86"></a><a class="nounder4" href="39_split_000.html#ch13fn86-r" id="ch13--465">86</a></sup> The same applied to the exploitation of the peasantry.

      In <em class="calibre19" id="ch13--468">The Peasant War in Germany</em>, Engels extended the perspective of a revolutionary

      of working it out in the present and future.
    </div>
<div class="indent2" id="ch13--469">
      The revolution of 1848-1849 had not been able to complete the <a class="calibre4" id="page_385"></a>emancipation of the peasants
      from feudal burdens, let alone from capitalist exploitation: this, “although in a changed form, remains a
      question still to be settled in a revolution to come,” wrote Marx in 1858.<sup class="calibre20" id="ch13--471"><a class="calibre4" id="ch13fn87"></a><a class="nounder4" href="39_split_000.html#ch13fn87-r" id="ch13--473">87</a></sup> Germany therefore showed
      a pattern in which the newer evils of capitalism were growing apace while the old evils of feudalism still hung

      peasant element in the coming social revolution.

<div class="indent2" id="ch13--474">
      The Prussian government was still harassing the peasantry in the interests of the old reaction. “At this very

      The industrial revolution is still going on, even under the most unfavorable conditions. Domestic-industry

      hardly gets industrialized before he is again crushed by steam and machinery. His extra earnings from
      agriculture, the potatoes he grows himself, become the strongest force depressing his wages for the capitalists,
      who can now bestow the whole of the normal surplus-value on the foreign customer as their sole means of
      maintaining a competitive position on the world market, and whose entire profit is made through the deduction

      The peasant gets the worst of both worlds. A couple of years later Engels stressed the effects of the continuing
      dominance in German capitalism of “rural domestic-industry and manufacture” (such as beet-sugar manufacture and
      spirit-distilling on the estates) instead of urban-concentrated big industry. As domestic-industry spreads in the
      rural areas, the industrial revolution is spread over a wider territory than in France or England, even if still
      on a lower level. This explains why the German revolutionary movement “has spread so tremendously over the
      greater part of the country instead of being confined exclusively to urban centers.”<sup class="calibre20" id="ch13--492"><a class="calibre4" id="ch13fn91"></a><a class="nounder4" href="39_split_000.html#ch13fn91-r" id="ch13--494">91</a></sup>

      peasant” who still owed labor-service to the lord: “Now that the bourgeoisie has failed in its duty of freeing
      these people from serfdom, it will not be difficult to convince them that they can expect salvation only from the

      people, unless it is compelled to. From whom then should they expect salvation if not from the workers?” The free
      small-holding peasant is a harder case, even though he can expect nothing from the bourgeoisie and its usurers;
      for most of them cling to their property, their little patch of ground:

<div class="bq2" id="ch13--513">
      It will have to be brought home to them all the same that they can be freed from the usurer only when a

<div class="bq2" id="ch13--531">
      The hazy socialistic aspirations of the Revolution of February 1848 were rapidly disposed of by the reactionary
      ballots of the French peasantry; the peasant, who wanted peace of mind, dug up from his treasured memories the
      legend of Napoleon, the emperor of the peasants, and created the Second Empire. We all know what this one feat of

      revolutionary élan which was being harnessed by reaction but which could also serve other ends under other
      leaders; it reflected a revolutionary potential, hence something quite different from the peasantry’s usual
      apathy.

      Around early 1850 Marx thought he saw the peasants already getting disillusioned with their peasant emperor, and
      published a remarkably optimistic view of the degree of radicalization among them:

      The great mass of the rural population, ruined by the results of land parcellization, by the tax burden and the
      purely fiscal and (even from the bourgeois standpoint) deleterious character of most of the taxes, disillusioned
      about Louis Napoleon’s promises and the reactionary deputies—the mass of the rural population has thrown itself
      into the arms of the revolutionary party and embraces a socialism which, to be sure, is still mostly very crude
      and bourgeois.

      stationary class,” which in turn necessitated repressive governmental measures that “inoculated every village
      with revolution; they <em class="calibre19" id="ch13--562">localized and peasantized the revolution.</em>” He set the overthrow of
      capitalism and the establishment of a socialist government as the program for the peasant too:

      We need hardly point out that the rosy glow of confidence in the peasantry was unjustified, but this error was
      only part of the larger misestimation, which was corrected in September when Marx recognized that the
      revolutionary situation had passed. The important point for us is what Marx expected from a peasantry caught up
      in social revolution.
    </div>
<div class="indent2" id="ch13--571">
      In this sense, Marx’s expectations continued even after September, for we have seen that all through the 1850s he
      expected thoroughgoing disillusionment with Bonaparte among both the bourgeoisie and the peasantry,<sup class="calibre20" id="ch13--572"><a class="calibre4" id="ch13fn104"></a><a class="nounder4" href="39_split_000.html#ch13fn104-r" id="ch13--574">104</a></sup> and
      therefore an upturn in the radicalization of the countryside. This was true even after December 1851, Bonaparte’s
      coup d’état. Of course, immediate hopes in the discontent of the peasants were dashed; it was clear that
      Bonaparte had successfully utilized their relapse into normal conservatism and apathy. But writing in 1852, Marx
      still saw the peasantry, or a considerable part of it, as a potentially revolutionary force. In <em class="calibre19" id="ch13--575">The Eighteenth Brumaire</em>, far from giving up the peasantry as a bad job after this “feat” of
      theirs, Marx highlights the fact that the “emperor of the peasants” is already using military and police force to
      quell peasant discontent. There had been “no similar persecution of the peasants” since Louis XIV.<a class="calibre4" id="ch13en8-r"></a><a class="nounder4" href="43.html#ch13en8" id="ch13--577">*</a>

      But let there be no misunderstanding. The Bonaparte dynasty represents not the revolutionary, but the
      conservative peasant; not the peasant that strikes out beyond the condition of his social existence, the small
      holding, but rather the peasant who wants to consolidate this holding; not the country folk who, linked up with
      the towns, want to overthrow the old order through their own energies, but on the contrary those who, in
      stupefied seclusion within this old order, want to see themselves and their small holdings saved and favored by
      the ghost of the empire. It represents <a class="calibre4" id="page_391"></a>not the enlightenment, but the superstition of the

      “Under the parliamentary republic” of 1848-1850, adds Marx, “the modern and the traditional consciousness of the
      French peasant contended for mastery.” This was the conflict between his future and his past, again. In the
      present, capitalist development was draining the peasant. And—“With the progressive undermining of small-holding
      property, the state structure erected upon it collapses.”<sup class="calibre20" id="ch13--585"><a class="calibre4" id="ch13fn107"></a><a class="nounder4" href="39_split_000.html#ch13fn107-r" id="ch13--587">107</a></sup>

      The emphasis is Marx’s; and there are few stronger statements of the impossibility of proletarian revolution “in

      about developments in France which was, once again, grossly overoptimistic about the peasantry—so overoptimistic
      that, when Marx republished this essay in 1869, with Bonaparte still in the saddle, he cut this passage out. The
      prediction had to go, since in 1869 it read as a disappointed hope; but our attention should be fixed on the
      italicized statement, as a general conception.

<div class="indent2" id="ch13--609">
      From early on, Engels linked the peasant question closely to the problem of revolutionary defense against the
      armed forces of the state; for these armed forces were dependent, everywhere on the Continent, on the sons of the
      peasantry to make up their ranks. We will take up the most prominent such problem in Volume 3, in connection with
      Germany. Suffice it to say here that this fact is another indication of how superficial the “Marx against the
      peasant” approach is; for the peasant question was vital to the revolution in ways that had nothing to do with
      one’s opinion of the peasant way of life.
    </div>
<div class="indent2" id="ch13--610">
      In 1851 Engels wrote a memorandum, not for publication, on the military problem that would be faced by a
      revolutionary France if, the following year, it threw off Bonaparte’s yoke and was attacked by the armies of the
      Holy Alliance. Since he concludes that a new-baked workers’ state “will have to carry on war with the means and
      according to the method of the general contemporary military operation”—not being in a position to transform the
      military sphere in twenty-four hours on the day after the revolution—he likewise concludes that the main source
      of regular soldiers will remain the same: “the °mob° and the peasants.”<sup class="calibre20" id="ch13--611"><a class="calibre4" id="ch13fn112"></a><a class="nounder4" href="39_split_000.html#ch13fn112-r" id="ch13--613">112</a></sup> In addition, he sees a
      peasant militia operating in the countryside as a guard against counterrevolution, as well as a proletarian
      militia in the cities, and the two cooperating to garrison the fortresses and “to disarm the rebel
      [counterrevolutionary] departments and classes,” while the regular troops defend the borders.<sup class="calibre20" id="ch13--614"><a class="calibre4" id="ch13fn113"></a><a class="nounder4" href="39_split_000.html#ch13fn113-r" id="ch13--616">113</a></sup> It
      is made quite clear that, even apart from other political and social considerations, a proletarian revolution in
      France could not survive <em class="calibre19" id="ch13--617">militarily</em> without support from at least a decisive section of
      the peasantry.
    </div>
<div class="indent2" id="ch13--618">
      A revolution came not one year but twenty years after Engels’ memo, and the problem was not that which was
      expected. It could be better described in terms of Marx’s statement in <em class="calibre19" id="ch13--619">The Eighteenth
      Brumaire:</em> the Paris Commune sang a solo song, which became a swan song when it failed to obtain the chorus
      from the countryside. The Versailles government succeeded in isolating the Parisians from the provinces, thus
      preventing an alliance of the working people of the city with the working people on the land.
    </div>
<div class="indent2" id="ch13--620">
      It is instructive to note that Marx’s analysis in <em class="calibre19" id="ch13--621">The Civil War in France</em>, written while
      the Commune was still struggling to survive and without the benefit of historical hindsight, lays far more
      emphasis on <a class="calibre4" id="page_393"></a>the peasant question than the Commune itself did or than is even to be found in
      knowledgeable books written long afterwards, such as Jellinek’s history. Furthermore, this analysis was condensed
      by Marx from a considerably more extensive discussion of the peasant question in his first draft. In both
      versions, most of the space was devoted to developing a specific program of peasant demands for the Commune. We
      will return to this program in the next chapter. Here we stress that this was a program for cementing a
      proletarian-peasant alliance behind the spreading of a Commune revolution to all France.

<div class="indent2" id="ch13--623">
      “The Commune was perfectly right in telling the peasants that ‘its victory was their only hope!’” So begins this
      passage in <em class="calibre19" id="ch13--624">The Civil War.</em> It explains that the pro-Bonapartist leaning of the peasantry
      was already undermined: “this prejudice of the past, how could it have withstood the appeal of the Commune to the
      living interests and urgent wants of the peasantry?”
    </div>
<div class="bq3" id="ch13--625">
      The Rurals [landowners behind the Versailles government] —this was, in fact, their chief apprehension—knew that
      three months’ free communication of Communal Paris with the provinces would bring about a general rising of the
      peasants, and hence their anxiety to establish a police blockade around Paris…<sup class="calibre20" id="ch13--626"><a class="calibre4" id="ch13fn114"></a><a class="nounder4" href="39_split_000.html#ch13fn114-r" id="ch13--628">114</a></sup>

      °°The “rurals” know that three months rule of the Republican Empire in France, would be the signal of the rising
      of the peasantry and the agricultural Proletariat against them. Hence their ferocious hatred of the Commune! What
      they fear even more than the emancipation of the townish [urban] proletariat is the emancipation of the peasants.
      The peasants would soon acclaim the townish proletariat as their own leaders and seniors.
    </div>
<div class="noindentt1" id="ch13--631">
      On the basis of considerable exposition, the draft concludes (similarly to the final version) that “What
      separates the peasant from the proletarian is, therefore, no longer his real interest, but his delusive
      prejudice.” The Commune is “the only form of government” that can rescue the peasant from an economic
      blind-alley, “without annihilating his position as a really independent producer.” It ends: “Being immediately
      benefited by the Communal Republic, he [the peasant] would soon confide in it [trust it].”<sup class="calibre20" id="ch13--632"><a class="calibre4" id="ch13fn115"></a><a class="nounder4" href="39_split_000.html#ch13fn115-r" id="ch13--634">115</a></sup>

      The Commune told the peasants that “its victory was their only <a class="calibre4" id="page_394"></a>hope” in a manifesto which
      was not only much delayed but which had to be distributed to the rural areas by scatter-drops from balloons: such
      was the effect of the blockade. The Parisians were unable to send organizers and agitators into the country
      districts to carry their message, which was summarized in the manifesto as “The land to the peasant, the tool to
      the worker, work for all.”<a class="calibre4" id="ch13en9-r"></a><a class="nounder4" href="43.html#ch13en9" id="ch13--638">*</a>

      When the London conference of the International met four months after the fall of the Commune, Marx pressed
      vigorously for the movement to make a turn on peasant work. The skimpy minutes show him opening this discussion
      with a statement which is summarized as follows:
    </div>
<div class="bq3" id="ch13--640">

</div>
<div class="noindentt1" id="ch13--645">
      That is, much of the concern awakened on the peasant question stemmed from the recognized need to counteract the
      military power of the government—a consideration that the urban radical mind could grasp easily enough, and that
      was already well known and beyond dispute in the movement. But Marx had not even mentioned this point in his
      <em class="calibre19" id="ch13--646">Civil War in France</em>, which was addressed to the public; there he had been concerned with
      the broader issue, the forging of a general social-revolutionary alliance with the peasantry.
    </div>
<div class="indent2" id="ch13--647">
      The minutes show Marx objecting to taking a purely organizational approach to the problem; this is “too narrow:
      the big question is how one can reconcile the interests of the cities and of the countryside.” This had been done
      in general and in brief in <em class="calibre19" id="ch13--648">The Civil War in France</em>, <a class="calibre4" id="page_395"></a>but he wanted a
      more detailed and locally specific approach; therefore the various Federal Councils should prepare reports on
      this question for the next congress. Both proposals were incorporated into a resolution which was adopted
      unanimously.<sup class="calibre20" id="ch13--650"><a class="calibre4" id="ch13fn119"></a><a class="nounder4" href="39_split_000.html#ch13fn119-r" id="ch13--652">119</a></sup> It was entitled “Agricultural Producers”—a term inclusive of peasants and
      farm laborers. Section 1 provided for reports to the next congress “on the means of securing the adhesion of the
      agricultural producers to the movement of the industrial proletariat.” Section 2 asked the Federal Councils to
      send “agitators” (delegates, organizers) to the rural districts, to hold meetings, spread principles, and found
      rural branches.<sup class="calibre20" id="ch13--653"><a class="calibre4" id="ch13fn120"></a><a class="nounder4" href="39_split_000.html#ch13fn120-r" id="ch13--655">120</a></sup>

<div class="indent2" id="ch13--656">
      After this, the minutes summarize a statement by Marx as follows: “There has been too much preoccupation with

      In the ensuing years, as we have indicated elsewhere, it was Engels who in fact paid most attention to the
      revolutionary need for a proletarian-peasant alliance. As concerned France, we may set down the following two
      statements as representative.
    </div>
<div class="indent2" id="ch13--661">
      In a survey of the European labor movement of 1877, Engels’ section on France saw the republicanization of the
      peasants as “a change of the highest importance”: “It means also the approaching alliance between the workingmen
      of the towns and the peasantry of the country.” The peasants “must soon find out that their only real remedy lies
      in an alliance with the only class that has no interest in their present miserable conditions, the working class
      of the town.” The fate of the Commune is reflected in Engels’ expectation that the dominance of republicanism
      will pave the way for the organization of an independent political party of the workers and also furnish “the
      ground, too, upon which they can unite with the hitherto hostile mass of the peasantry and thus render future
      victories not, as heretofore, shortlived triumphs of Paris over France, but final triumphs of all the oppressed
      classes of France, led by the workmen of Paris and the large provincial towns.”<sup class="calibre20" id="ch13--662"><a class="calibre4" id="ch13fn122"></a><a class="nounder4" href="39_split_000.html#ch13fn122-r" id="ch13--664">122</a></sup>

<div class="indent2" id="ch13--665">
      The peasantry would have to realize, he thought, “that they are being robbed” by capital. The socialists must
      persist even if there are no apparent results for a long time: “It is a long and wearisome task to enlighten
      peasants on political matters, but they will not be so stupid as not to realize at this juncture that they are
      being robbed. But once they have spotted that, there is nothing for them but to turn to the Socialists, the only
      party which is not involved in the thefts …”<sup class="calibre20" id="ch13--666"><a class="calibre4" id="ch13fn123"></a><a class="nounder4" href="39_split_000.html#ch13fn123-r" id="ch13--668">123</a></sup>

<div class="indent2" id="ch13--669">
<a class="calibre4" id="page_396"></a>By the time these last words were written, the nature of the problem in the movement had
      changed: it had swung from ignoring the peasantry to vote-catching by opportunist appeals to peasant prejudices.
      This was the target of Engels’ major work, “The Peasant Question in France and Germany.”
    </div>
<h3 class="h4" id="ch13lev13">13. ITALY, DENMARK, SPAIN</h3>
<div class="indent2" id="ch13--672">
      Outside of the more industrialized countries of Western Europe, which we have been considering, the importance of
      a proletarian-peasant alliance was even greater and clearer. In these countries, the problems to be taken up in
      the next chapter were more difficult. However, there were complications where the national question intervened
      and where prebourgeois social systems were especially prominent.
    </div>
<div class="indent2" id="ch13--673">
      Italy’s situation was not complicated in this way. A didactic letter by Engels to an Italian comrade spelled out
      the ABC of the matter in an intentionally elementary way, keeping in mind that the main problem of alliance under
      consideration was not with the peasantry (who were not organized politically as a class) but with the
      petty-bourgeois republican movement of the Mazzini type.
    </div>
<div class="indent2" id="ch13--674">
      In the background of this problem is the need for a political bloc of “the working people—peasants,
      handicraftsmen, agricultural and industrial workers.” (The order is tailored to Italy.) The socialist movement is
      young and weak. “Throughout the country the agricultural population far outweighs the urban.” Even in the towns,
      industry is undeveloped, “hence <em class="calibre19" id="ch13--675">typical</em> proletarians are scarce.” The town population is
      still largely “the petty and middle bourgeoisie of the Middle Ages in decay and disintegration, for the most part
      proletarians of the future but not yet proletarians of the present.” These class elements, made desperate by the
      prospect of economic ruin, will furnish the ranks and leaders of a revolutionary movement. “On this road it will
      be followed by the peasants, who are prevented from displaying any effective initiative by their lands being too
      scattered and by their illiteracy, but who in any event will be powerful and indispensable allies.”<sup class="calibre20" id="ch13--676"><a class="calibre4" id="ch13fn124"></a><a class="nounder4" href="39_split_000.html#ch13fn124-r" id="ch13--678">124</a></sup>

      Denmark was a country that consisted mainly of a capital city plus a rural hinterland. Toward the end of 1871
      Engels gave the General Council of the International an interesting report on the political situation <a class="calibre4" id="page_397"></a>there. The Danish branch was based on the small town proletariat, emphasized agitation among the
      agricultural laborers, and wanted to reach out to the small peasants to win them away from the “Peasants Friends

      an independent party—distinct from the so-called “<em class="calibre19" id="ch13--682">Peasants Friends</em>,” but in intimate
      union with the working men of the towns.<sup class="calibre20" id="ch13--683"><a class="calibre4" id="ch13fn125"></a><a class="nounder4" href="39_split_000.html#ch13fn125-r" id="ch13--685">125</a></sup>

<div class="noindentt1" id="ch13--692">
      A few years later, his account of the Danish socialists’ alliance with the peasant party had to be more critical

      peasantry, as the key to revolution.

      In Spain, theory was confirmed negatively—as has too often been true. One had to point to the disabling
      characteristics of the peasantry, as Marx did often enough, but in the last analysis it was the task of
      revolutionists to find a solution; and a failure was <em class="calibre19" id="ch13--697">their</em> failure. In 1854 Marx wrote,
      looking backward:
    </div>
<div class="bq3" id="ch13--698">
      The defeat of the revolution of 1820-1823 can be easily explained. It was a bourgeois revolution, more accurately
      an urban revolution, while the countryside—ignorant, inert, devoted to the church’s ceremonial pomp—remained
      passive spectators of the conflict of factions, which it hardly understood. In the few provinces in which
      exceptionally it actively participated in the struggle, this took place rather on the side of the
      counterrevolution—a fact which need not surprise one in Spain, “that storehouse of old customs, that repository
      of everything that is elsewhere gone and forgotten” … The fact that the revolutionary <a class="calibre4" id="page_398"></a>party
      did not know how to unite the interests of the peasantry with the urban movement was confirmed by two men both of
      whom played a substantial role in the revolution, Generals Morillo and San Miguel. [Marx then quotes them.]

<div class="indent2" id="ch13--707">
      Ireland was the most prominent case before Marx of an interpenetration of peasant question and national question.
      Colonial oppression by England was combined with a socioeconomic and cultural association of the two peoples that
      was much closer than, say, between England and India. Industrialized Irish peasants became proletarians <em class="calibre19" id="ch13--708">in England;</em> an Irish liberation movement—like the Fenians of the 1860s, whom Marx and Engels
      supported against English imperialism—was perhaps as active in England (and the United States) as in Ireland
      itself; and so on. The enormous interest in Ireland and the Irish movement taken by Marx and Engels was fed from
      several directions,<a class="calibre4" id="ch13en10-r"></a><a class="nounder4" href="43.html#ch13en10" id="ch13--710">*</a> but at
      bottom was the very close and immediate connection they saw between the revolutionary potential of the Irish
      peasantry and the fate of the proletarian revolution in England.
    </div>
<div class="indent2" id="ch13--711">
      They were keenly aware of the weaknesses and self-defeating tactics of the Fenian leadership (an important
      subject outside the purview of this chapter), but there could be no question of counterposing a nonexistent Irish
      working-class movement. The Irish revolution that Marx supported and hoped for was going to be a peasant
      revolution primarily. “What the Irish need,” wrote Marx to Engels, “is: (1) Self-government and independence from
      England. (2) An agrarian revolution.”<sup class="calibre20" id="ch13--712"><a class="calibre4" id="ch13fn129"></a><a class="nounder4" href="39_split_000.html#ch13fn129-r" id="ch13--714">129</a></sup> <a class="calibre4" id="page_399"></a>The overthrow of English rule would doom

      What Marx worked out as he went along was the interweaving of three problems: the struggle of the Irish workers
      in England; the land question and peasant exploitation in Ireland; and the question of Irish national liberation.
      He did not start with the preconception that Irish national freedom depended on agrarian revolution; this became
      clear to him as he wrestled with the concrete problem. In 1867 he gave an hour-and-a-half lecture on the
      historical roots of the Irish question, concluding: “The Irish question is therefore not simply a nationality
      question, but a question of land and existence. Ruin or revolution is the watchword …”<sup class="calibre20" id="ch13--722"><a class="calibre4" id="ch13fn131"></a><a class="nounder4" href="39_split_000.html#ch13fn131-r" id="ch13--724">131</a></sup> In a letter of 1869 he
      stressed that in Ireland the peasant struggle against landlordism “is not merely a simple economic question but
      at the same time a <em class="calibre19" id="ch13--725">national</em> question” since the landlords are “mortally hated oppressors”
      from another country, England.<sup class="calibre20" id="ch13--726"><a class="calibre4" id="ch13fn132"></a><a class="nounder4" href="39_split_000.html#ch13fn132-r" id="ch13--728">132</a></sup> There was a reciprocal effect: the same day, as it happened, Engels wrote
      Marx a letter chortling over the electoral victory of the Fenians: “if the English workers cannot take an example
      from the peasants of Tipperary, they are in a bad way.”<sup class="calibre20" id="ch13--729"><a class="calibre4" id="ch13fn133"></a><a class="nounder4" href="39_split_000.html#ch13fn133-r" id="ch13--731">133</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="indent2" id="ch13--732">
      About a month later Marx wrote a statement for the International on the Irish question, giving the Irish peasant
      struggle a key spot on the world stage: England is the bulwark of European landlordism and capitalism; its most
      vulnerable point is its hold on Ireland; if landlordism fell in Ireland it would fall in England.
    </div>
<div class="bq2" id="ch13--733">
      In Ireland this is a hundred times easier since <em class="calibre19" id="ch13--734">the economic struggle there is concentrated

      Ireland is the bulwark of the <em class="calibre19" id="ch13--740">English landed aristocracy.</em> … Ireland is therefore the

      infinitely easier operation than in England itself, because in Ireland <em class="calibre19" id="ch13--744">the land question</em>
      has hitherto been the <em class="calibre19" id="ch13--745">exclusive form</em> of the social question … This quite apart from the

<div class="indent2" id="ch13--761">
      This line of thought played a very important role in the practical work of the International in England. Under
      Marx’s guidance, the International became a considerable force for cementing an alliance between the Irish
      peasant revolution and the English working-class struggle. And because of England’s international role, the
      consequences would be seen also on the Continent: such was the prospect.
    </div>
<div class="indent2" id="ch13--762">
      The breakdown of England’s landownership system in Ireland, Marx thought, would also lead to an alliance in the
      English countryside (without peasants). Arrayed against the English landowning power at home would be “the
      British farmers, wincing under high rents and … low prices; the British agricultural labourers, at last impatient
      of their traditional position of ill-used beasts of burden,” plus the dubious support of the bourgeois party that
      labeled itself “Radical.”<sup class="calibre20" id="ch13--763"><a class="calibre4" id="ch13fn138"></a><a class="nounder4" href="39_split_000.html#ch13fn138-r" id="ch13--765">138</a></sup> Needless to say, such an alliance on the English countryside would be of
      vital concern to the proletarian movement.

      with the English working class as their English counterparts. For “to these gentry,” wrote Engels, “the whole

      workers are his sole allies in Europe.”<sup class="calibre20" id="ch13--769"><a class="calibre4" id="ch13fn142"></a><a class="nounder4" href="39_split_000.html#ch13fn142-r" id="ch13--771">142</a></sup>

<div class="indent2" id="ch13--774">
      When we come to Russia and Poland, Marx’s and Engels’ expectations from the revolutionary potential of the
      peasantry are so abundantly expressed that we need give only illustrative cases. The reason was not only the
      overwhelming peasant composition of the producing population, though this fact was basic. Since they regarded
      czarism as the kingpin of all European reaction, a revolution in Russia was most important from the standpoint of
      its international consequences: it was a way to blow up European reaction from within its main center. As long as
      no socialist movement or proletarian alternative was in sight, it virtually made no difference to Marx who, or
      what class, launched the revolutionary struggle, so long as it at least weakened the Muscovite colossus. It was
      only toward the end of his life that a proletarian socialist movement of some sort took its first shaky steps in
      Russia; until then, therefore, hope for revolution in Russia meant hope in the revolutionary potential of its
      peasantry above all, even if this potential were to be realized under the leadership of disaffected upper-class
      elements. Marx’s and Engels’ estimations more often show wishful thinking about activity by the Russian peasantry
      than any other European class.
    </div>
<div class="indent2" id="ch13--775">
      Of course, incidental remarks in personal letters between the two men were less weightily considered than
      published articles; but still they indicate lines of thought. As early as 1851, Engels mused, in a letter to
      Marx, about the dangers to Germany of a European “brawl,” and remarked: “Outside of Hungary, Germany would have
      only one possible ally, Russia—provided that a peasant revolution was carried out there.”<sup class="calibre20" id="ch13--776"><a class="calibre4" id="ch13fn143"></a><a class="nounder4" href="39_split_000.html#ch13fn143-r" id="ch13--778">143</a></sup> A
      few years later Marx told the readers of the <em class="calibre19" id="ch13--779">New York Tribune</em>, regarding the czar’s plans
      for the coming emancipation of the serfs:
    </div>
<div class="bq3" id="ch13--780">
      If we recollect that since 1842 the insurrections of serfs against their landlords and stewards have become
      epidemic; that <a class="calibre4" id="page_402"></a>something like sixty nobles … have been annually murdered by the peasants;
      that during the late [Crimean] war the insurrections increased enormously, and in the western provinces were
      directed chiefly against the Government… there can be little doubt that, even if the nobility does not resist the
      emancipation, the attempt to realize the committee’s proposals [for a Parliament of Nobles] must be the signal
      for a tremendous conflagration among the rural population of Russia. … [The serfs] are surer than ever to rise.
      And if they do, the Russian 1793 will be at hand; the reign of terror of these half-Asiatic serfs will be
      something unequaled in history; but it will be the second turning point in Russian history, and finally place
      real and general civilization in the place of that sham and show introduced by Peter the Great.<sup class="calibre20" id="ch13--782"><a class="calibre4" id="ch13fn144"></a><a class="nounder4" href="39_split_000.html#ch13fn144-r" id="ch13--784">144</a></sup>

      insurrection in Russia, but, to Engels, the peasant movement “will irresistibly be pushed farther along” because
      of the oppressive conditions of the peasant masses.<sup class="calibre20" id="ch13--791"><a class="calibre4" id="ch13fn148"></a><a class="nounder4" href="39_split_000.html#ch13fn148-r" id="ch13--793">148</a></sup> He expressed this sentiment in a context that deserves
      some attention.
    </div>
<div class="indent2" id="ch13--794">
      The context was his polemic against one Tkachov, an old-style Russian revolutionary influenced by Blanquism and
      Bakunin.<sup class="calibre20" id="ch13--795"><a class="calibre4" id="ch13fn149"></a><a class="nounder4" href="39_split_000.html#ch13fn149-r" id="ch13--797">149</a></sup> Tkachov had attacked Engels’ views from the standpoint of “peasant
      socialism”: the Russian peasant was an “instinctive revolutionist,” who, because of his village-communal
      institutions, was closer to socialism than was the Western socialist movement. Engels’ reply raked this
      conception of building a revolutionary socialist movement on peasant-style revolutionism and the conception of
      peasant socialism in general. But within this framework, he went on to give credit to the revolutionary potential
      of the peasant in his own way.

<div class="bq3" id="ch13--798">
      It is clear that the condition of the Russian peasants since the emancipation from serfdom has become intolerable

      revolution is in the offing in Russia….

<div class="bqa" id="ch13--800">
      Russia undoubtedly is on the eve of a revolution…. Here all the conditions of a revolution are combined, of a
      revolution which, started by the upper classes of the capital, perhaps even by the government itself, must be
      rapidly carried further, beyond the first constitutional phase, by the peasants; of a revolution which will be of
      the greatest importance for the whole of Europe if only because it will destroy at one blow the last, so far
      intact, reserve of the entire European reaction. This revolution is surely approaching.<sup class="calibre20" id="ch13--801"><a class="calibre4" id="ch13fn150"></a><a class="nounder4" href="39_split_000.html#ch13fn150-r" id="ch13--803">150</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="indentt1" id="ch13--804">
      At this time Engels expected the <em class="calibre19" id="ch13--805">initiative</em> in the revolution to come from the urban
      upper classes (as was indeed the case in March 1917); of the proletariat there were only beginnings. The
      revolutionary push of the peasant masses would provide the gigantic groundswell that would carry the revolution
      “beyond the first constitutional phase.”<sup class="calibre20" id="ch13--806"><a class="calibre4" id="ch13fn151"></a><a class="nounder4" href="39_split_000.html#ch13fn151-r" id="ch13--808">151</a></sup> How far beyond it? The crystal ball did not always give the
      same answer; nor was a definite prognostication necessary. Marx had long before spoken of the coming “1793” in
      Russia. In a letter to a correspondent in 1885, Engels opined that “Russia faces its 1789,” after vigorously
      asserting that “The so-called emancipation of the peasants has created a thoroughly revolutionary situation, by
      moving the peasants into a situation in which they can neither live nor die,” a situation sharpened by the rapid
      development of large industry.<sup class="calibre20" id="ch13--809"><a class="calibre4" id="ch13fn152"></a><a class="nounder4" href="39_split_000.html#ch13fn152-r" id="ch13--811">152</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="indent2" id="ch13--812">
      But as industrial development changed Russia, especially by producing a new working class and its concomitant
      socialist movement, Engels’ emphasis shifted accordingly. In an 1894 postscript to the polemic against Tkachov,
      Engels referred back to the possibility “after the Crimean War” of “direct parliamentary rule by the nobility and
      the bureaucracy” as a consequence of the overthrow of the czarist autocracy; but by 1894 the bourgeoisification
      of Russian society had gone on apace. What Engels now stressed was the perspective of a Russian revolution “in
      combination with a revolution in Western Europe.” In any case, a revolution in Russia would “lead the peasants
      out into the large arena” of the outside world, and it would “also give a fresh impulse to the labor movement in
      the West,” for only the victory of the modern industrial proletariat would permit Russia to achieve its own
      socialist transformation.<sup class="calibre20" id="ch13--813"><a class="calibre4" id="ch13fn153"></a><a class="nounder4" href="39_split_000.html#ch13fn153-r" id="ch13--815">153</a></sup>

      The problem of the Russian revolution, then, changed rapidly in the <a class="calibre4" id="page_404"></a>last part of the
      century, and this must be borne in mind also in connection with the problems discussed in the next chapter. What
      did not change for Marx or Engels, however, was the international motivation for spurring revolution in Russia.
      This added greatly to the importance of peasant movements elsewhere in the Slavic world and on the periphery of
      the Russian empire, such as those in Poland and Turkey.<a class="calibre4" id="ch13en13-r"></a><a class="nounder4" href="43.html#ch13en13" id="ch13--819">*</a>
