<h1 id="ch14"><a class="calibre4" id="page_405"></a>14 THE PEASANT QUESTION: PROGRAMMATIC PROBLEMS</h1>
<div class="indent" id="ch14--2">
      For Marx there was never any question about the end-goal of the agrarian revolution: it was the socialization of
      agriculture on the basis of social ownership of the land. But this left open a number of political problems about
      the road by which the goal was to be attained, before and after a proletarian conquest of power. There were
      associated problems of tempo and form—how fast to move, what forms to use for reorganization. In this
      programmatic area, a great deal of flexibility was in order.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch14--3">
      Marx and Engels have not often been given credit for the considerable flexibility which in fact they demonstrated
      as they adapted their practical programmatic proposals to time, place, and circumstance within a framework
      comporting with the goal. The main problem that shadowed all considerations was, of course, that of bringing the
      peasantry along, particularly the small peasants.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch14--4">
      In this chapter, by exception, we anticipate in part a question to be treated at large in a later volume, namely,
      the socialist reorganization of society after a proletarian conquest of power. Here we deal with some issues
      bearing on the peasant question, but without the general context that will be set forth. While this entails
      leaving some loose ends now, there is no good alternative; for on no other question is there a closer connection
      between immediate policy and future (post-revolution) program. That connection exists first and foremost in the
      minds of the peasants themselves.

<h2 id="ch14lev1">1. SOCIALIZATION OF LAND</h2>
<div class="indent" id="ch14--6">
      The goal of land socialization and the abolition of private property in the soil was already strongly stated in
      Marx’s Paris manuscripts of <a class="calibre6" id="page_406"></a>1844. There his argument is directed first against the
      parcellization of large landed estates as a solution of the problem of monopoly—because of its economic
      disadvantages and because it will only lead back to “accumulation” once again, just as small-unit competition
      does in industry. The only real solution is to negate monopoly in a different form:
    </div>
<div class="bq" id="ch14--8">
      To do that, however, is not to return to feudal ownership, but to abolish private property in the soil
      altogether…. Association [socialism], applied to land, shares the economic advantage of large-scale landed
      property, and first brings to realization the original tendency inherent in [land] division, namely, equality. In
      the same way association also re-establishes, now on a rational basis, no longer mediated by serfdom,
      overlordship and the silly mysticism of property, the intimate ties of man with the earth, since the earth ceases
      to be an object of huckstering, and through free labor and free enjoyment becomes once more a true personal
      property of man.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch14--9"><a class="calibre14" id="ch14fn1"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch14fn1-r" id="ch14--11">1</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="indentt" id="ch14--12">
      The ten-point program in the <em class="calibre8" id="ch14--13">Communist Manifesto</em>—by and large a compilation of demands
      popular among the revolutionary left—included this goal as point no. 1: “Expropriation of landed property and
      application of ground rent for state expenditures.”<a class="calibre6" id="ch14en1-r"></a><a class="nounder1" href="43.html#ch14en1" id="ch14--15">*</a>
</div>
<div class="indent" id="ch14--16">
      The case for land socialization was conveniently summarized by Marx many years later in a memorandum which was
      specifically concerned with England. This summary argument, which was intended as a guide to a popularized
      presentation, stresses that land nationalization is a “social necessity” because it makes possible the vast
      increase in production needed to satisfy “the ever-growing wants of the people,” by fully utilizing the
      scientific knowledge and technical means which are applicable only in large-scale operations; because “a few
      individuals” (owners) cannot be allowed to regulate agricultural production “according to their whims and private
      interests or to ignorantly exhaust the powers of the soil”; and because capitalist cultivation leads to “the
      ever-increasing price of agricultural produce” for the masses of people while it “degrades the producer
      [land-tiller] himself to a mere beast of burden.”<sup class="calibre13" id="ch14--17"><a class="calibre14" id="ch14fn3"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch14fn3-r" id="ch14--19">3</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="indent" id="ch14--20">
<a class="calibre6" id="page_407"></a>The basic importance of the question struck Marx forcibly in the middle of a letter to
      Engels in 1851, and we get a strong statement in a passing remark:
    </div>
<div class="bq" id="ch14--22">
      But the more I go into the crap, the more I become convinced that the reform of agriculture, hence also of the
      property shit based on it, is the alpha and omega of the coming revolutionary transformation. Without that,
      Father Malthus would prove to be right.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch14--23"><a class="calibre14" id="ch14fn3a"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch14fn3a-r" id="ch14--25">3a</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="indentt" id="ch14--26">
      But land socialization was by no means a closed question in the socialist movement. It was opposed by a number of
      petty-bourgeois radical currents: in England, Feargus O’Connor’s wing of Chartism; in France and Belgium, the
      Proudhonists; in Germany, such allies of the socialists as the South German People’s Party. The two viewpoints
      locked horns inside the International. At the Brussels congress in 1868, land socialization was passed by a small
      and uncertain majority; but at the Basel Congress the following year, it was adopted overwhelmingly, against only
      a handful of Proudhonist votes.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch14--27">
      This decision fluttered the International’s opponents on all sides. The reformist leaders in Switzerland,
      Austria, and Germany “are yelling blue murder,” Marx wrote in a letter.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch14--28"><a class="calibre14" id="ch14fn4"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch14fn4-r" id="ch14--30">4</a></sup> In South Germany, the
      People’s Party denounced it; and so Wilhelm Liebknecht—opportunist as usual—wanted to maintain socialist
      neutrality toward the International decision, but a majority of the party executive overruled him.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch14--31">
      It had taken three congresses before the International was able to get to this point, for the social pressure of
      the peasant mass outside the movement was felt inside it through a variety of transmission belts. When the
      General Council was discussing the issue prior to the Basel Congress, a visitor from Paris, the future anarchist
      Elisée Reclus, assured the Council members they need not be concerned with the peasantry, for “The peasants know
      very little what is going [on in] the world, they do not come to your Congresses, they do not even know that they
      are held; we have very little care about them. The men in the towns are for collective property.” To this
      blinkered urban-radical view, Marx replied (as summarized in the minutes): “The small peasantry is not at the
      Congresses, but their idealistic [i.e., ideological] representatives are there. The Proudhonists are very strong
      upon the point and they were at Brussels …”<sup class="calibre13" id="ch14--32"><a class="calibre14" id="ch14fn5"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch14fn5-r" id="ch14--34">5</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="indent" id="ch14--35">
      Immediately upon the adoption of the Basel resolution, International activists in England were instrumental in
      establishing the Land <a class="calibre6" id="page_408"></a>and Labour League, whose first plank was the nationalization of the
      land.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch14--37"><a class="calibre14" id="ch14fn6"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch14fn6-r" id="ch14--39">6</a></sup>
      Marx thought this enormously important:
    </div>
<div class="bq1" id="ch14--40">
      The formation of the <em class="calibre8" id="ch14--41">Land and Labour League</em> (which was directly brought about by the
      General Council, by the bye) is to be considered an outcome of the Basel Congress; thereby the workers’ party
      completely cuts loose from the bourgeoisie, nationalization of land being the starting point.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch14--42"><a class="calibre14" id="ch14fn7"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch14fn7-r" id="ch14--44">7</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="indentt" id="ch14--45">
      But the adoption of the principle did not foreclose programmatic questions of implementation. It was clear in the
      International debates that, although land collectivization would vest <em class="calibre8" id="ch14--46">ownership</em> in a
      workers’ state—that is, the power to determine how the land would be worked and by whom—it did not mean that the
      state must necessarily take over agriculture directly. At the Basel Congress, for example, one common idea was
      that small-holding peasants might continue in cultivation of their land without rent, at least for their own
      lifetime; cooperatives were another popular form, as we shall see.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch14--47">
      Nor did the adoption of the principle mean that, regardless of national circumstances, a workers’ state should
      nationalize the land by decree in one blow. This was a matter of tempo. Marx already indicated this before Basel,
      in the General Council’s pre-congress discussion:
    </div>
<div class="bq" id="ch14--48">
      In England the land could be transformed into common property by act of Parliament in the course of a fortnight.
      In France it must be accomplished by means of the proprietors’ indebtedness and liability to taxation.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch14--49"><a class="calibre14" id="ch14fn8"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch14fn8-r" id="ch14--51">8</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="noindentt" id="ch14--52">
      And by implication less developed countries might see even slower tempos. This element of flexibility applied not
      only to use, then, but also to ownership of the land.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch14--53">
      On this point particularly there would naturally be a great difference in ways and means applied to big peasants
      and small peasants. Writing to Marx about the brouhaha over the Basel “resolution on landed property,” Engels
      remarked that “people forget … that there are various kinds of peasants,” and that “for the present the
      proletariat has no interest in calling in question <em class="calibre8" id="ch14--54">small</em> landownership.”<sup class="calibre13" id="ch14--55"><a class="calibre14" id="ch14fn9"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch14fn9-r" id="ch14--57">9</a></sup> The
      following year he utilized a new preface to his <em class="calibre8" id="ch14--58">Peasant War in Germany</em> to make the point
      publicly. The context is the plan to turn large landed estates into cooperative agricultural associations.
    </div>
<div class="bq" id="ch14--59">
      And here we come to the famous decision of the International Working Men’s Congress in Basel: that it is in the
      interest of <a class="calibre6" id="page_409"></a>society to transform landed property into common, national property. This
      resolution was adopted mainly for the countries where there is big landed property, and where, in connection with
      that, these big estates are being operated with one master and many laborers. This state of affairs, however, is
      still as a whole predominant in Germany, and therefore, next to England, the decision was <em class="calibre8" id="ch14--61">most
      timely precisely for Germany</em>.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch14--62"><a class="calibre14" id="ch14fn10"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch14fn10-r" id="ch14--64">10</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="indentt" id="ch14--65">
      A similar view appears in the rough notes that Marx jotted down for himself in 1874-1875 on reading one of
      Bakunin’s polemics. Apropos of a passage in which Bakunin jibed that the peasantry does not enjoy “the good will
      of the Marxists,” who want the urban proletariat to dominate it, Marx scribbled this comment:
    </div>
<div class="bq" id="ch14--66">
      … where the peasant exists in mass numbers as a private-property owner, where he even forms a more or less
      considerable majority, as in all the states of the western European continent where he has not disappeared and
      been replaced by agricultural day-laborers as in England, the following cases come up: Either he obstructs,
      wrecks every workers’ revolution, as he has done in France up to now; or else the proletariat …<a class="calibre6" id="ch14en2-r"></a><a class="nounder1" href="43.html#ch14en2" id="ch14--68">*</a> must, as the government, take
      measures whereby the peasant sees his situation immediately improved and which therefore win him over to the
      revolution—measures, however, which in embryo facilitate the transition from private property in land to
      collective property, so that the peasant comes to it by himself, for economic reasons.
    </div>
<div class="noindentt" id="ch14--69">
      This establishes the general approach; the note continues with a specific rejection of the idea of taking away
      the small peasant’s land:
    </div>
<div class="bq" id="ch14--70">
      But the peasant should not be antagonized, for example by proclaiming the abolition of the right to
      inheritance<a class="calibre6" id="ch14en3-r"></a><a class="nounder1" href="43.html#ch14en3" id="ch14--72">**</a> or the abolition
      of his property. The latter is possible only where the capitalistic <a class="calibre6" id="page_410"></a>tenant-farmer has ousted
      the peasant and the actual cultivator of the soil is just as much a proletarian, a wage-worker, as is the urban
      worker, and therefore <em class="calibre8" id="ch14--74">directly</em>, not indirectly, has exactly the same interests as he does.
    </div>
<div class="noindentt" id="ch14--75">
      The warning could hardly be spelled out more clearly. But if Marx was opposed to expropriating the land tilled by
      the small peasant, he was equally opposed to breaking up the large estates already owned and worked
      capitalistically in order to turn this land over to small-holders.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch14--76"><a class="calibre14" id="ch14fn13"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch14fn13-r" id="ch14--78">13</a></sup> And this bisymmetric side
      of the perspective was set down in the last sentence of the note on Bakunin:
    </div>
<div class="bq" id="ch14--79">
      Still less should parcellized property be strengthened by enlarging the parcels simply by the peasants’
      annexation of the large estates, as in the Bakuninist revolutionary plan of campaign.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch14--80"><a class="calibre14" id="ch14fn14"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch14fn14-r" id="ch14--82">14</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="indentt" id="ch14--83">
      Marx never believed that, even in a Western European country like France, a revolutionary government was somehow
      duty-bound by principle to decree the immediate nationalization of all land, including that of the mass of small
      peasantry, regardless of other considerations. The complete process might take a generation, as envisaged at
      Basel; meanwhile there was plenty for a revolutionary government to do in order to move in that direction, as its
      goal. Marx came back to this in the aforementioned memorandum on land nationalization in England, in 1872,
      contrasting the application of the program in England as against France:
    </div>
<div class="bq1" id="ch14--84">
      °°France has often been alluded to, but with its <em class="calibre8" id="ch14--85">peasantry proprietorship</em> it is farther
      off the nationalisation of land than England with its landlordism.… Peasantry proprietorship being thus the
      greatest obstacle to the “nationalisation of land,” France, in its present state, is certainly not the place
      where we must look for a solution of this great problem.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch14--86"><a class="calibre14" id="ch14fn15"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch14fn15-r" id="ch14--88">15</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="noindentt" id="ch14--89">
      England was the country where the socialist solution was most immediately applicable. Here, where the ruling
      class intertwined both the industrial capitalist class and the big landowners, where the aristocratic wing
      operated the land capitalistically and the bourgeois wing aspired <a class="calibre6" id="page_411"></a>to landed estates, the
      same act would shake both parts of the ruling class to the foundations. Marx’s memorandum begins: “The property
      in the soil—that original source of all wealth, has become the great problem upon the solution of which depends
      the future of the working class.” And toward the end: “The nationalisation of land will work a complete change in
      the relations between labour and capital and finally do away altogether with capitalist production.”<sup class="calibre13" id="ch14--91"><a class="calibre14" id="ch14fn16"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch14fn16-r" id="ch14--93">16</a></sup> This
      applied specifically to England, and depended upon a political, not merely an economic, analysis—as was true also
      of Marx’s view that the overthrow of British landownership in Ireland would strike a fatal blow at British
      capitalism at home. (As far as economic considerations alone are concerned, nationalization of land is by no
      means incompatible with capitalism: Marx made this clear more than once.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch14--94"><a class="calibre14" id="ch14fn17"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch14fn17-r" id="ch14--96">17</a></sup>)
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch14--97">
      Some radicals wanted land nationalization as a means of establishing (or re-establishing) a class of
      small-holding farmers; the case of the Chartist wing under Feargus O’Connor will be discussed in section 5 below.
      Marx’s memorandum of 1872 once again opposes this economic nostrum:
    </div>
<div class="bq" id="ch14--98">
      °°To nationalise the land and let it out in small plots to individuals or workingmen’s societies, would, under a
      middle-class [i.e., bourgeois] government, only bring about a reckless competition amongst them, and cause a
      certain increase of “Rent,” and thus lend new facilities to the appropriators for feeding upon the
      producers.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch14--99"><a class="calibre14" id="ch14fn18"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch14fn18-r" id="ch14--101">18</a></sup>

<div class="indentt" id="ch14--102">
      Whichever way a workers’ state might decide to organize the operation of the land, it had to own the land, in the
      name of society as a whole, so that it could carry out its goals. Marx’s memorandum quotes the Belgian socialist
      leader César de Paepe at the Brussels Congress of 1868: “The soil must become the property of rural associations,
      or the property of the whole nation. The future will decide the question.” Marx disagrees with leaving the
      question open:
    </div>
<div class="bq1" id="ch14--103">
      °°I say on the contrary: “The future will decide that the land cannot be owned but nationally. To give up the
      soil to the hands of associated rural labourers, would be to surrender all society to one exclusive class of
      producers….”<sup class="calibre13" id="ch14--104"><a class="calibre14" id="ch14fn19"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch14fn19-r" id="ch14--106">19</a></sup>

<div class="noindentt" id="ch14--107">
      This is the basic ground for rejecting any sort of syndicalist setup as flagrantly undemocratic. The earth could
      not be handed over to ownership-control by narrow groups of workers, independent of control by <a class="calibre6" id="page_412"></a>working people as a whole, any more than the Food Workers Union had a right to decide who would be
      fed.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch14--109">
      But cooperative associations of rural laborers do have a key role in Marx’s program for socialist agriculture:
      this brings us to Marx’s and Engels’ views on the operation of socialized land.
    </div>
<h2 id="ch14lev2">2. SOCIALIST AGRICULTURE: COOPERATIVES</h2>
<div class="indent" id="ch14--111">
      The first step in socialist agriculture, then, would be to organize the operation of the big landed estates taken
      over from their semifeudal or capitalistic owners, including state domains—even if the rest of the land still
      remained for a period in the hands of the small-holders who already tilled it themselves. Engels (who got most
      concrete about all this) thought this first step would be “perfectly simple.” There is no record that the
      possibility of direct state operation of this land occurred to him; on the other hand there is no reason to
      suppose he, or any other socialist, would have rejected it if it seemed indicated by circumstances. The fact is
      that while Engels repeatedly outlined the socialist solution, he did so always in terms of cooperative
      associations.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch14--112">
      Here is how Engels explained it in his last work on the peasant question, after a good deal of discussion of
      peasant policy:
    </div>
<div class="bq1" id="ch14--113">
      Only the big landed estates present a perfectly simple case. Here we are dealing with undisguised capitalist
      production and no scruples of any sort need restrain us. Here we are confronted by rural proletarians in masses
      and our task is clear. As soon as our party is in possession of political power it has simply to expropriate the
      big landed proprietors just like the manufacturers in industry…. The big estates thus restored to the community
      are to be turned over to be organized into cooperatives. They are to be assigned to them for their use and
      benefit under the control of the community.<a class="calibre6" id="ch14en4-r"></a><a class="nounder1" href="43.html#ch14en4" id="ch14--115">*</a> Nothing can as yet be stated as to the terms of <a class="calibre6" id="page_413"></a>their tenure. At any
      rate the transformation of the capitalist enterprise into a socialist enterprise is here fully prepared for and
      can be carried into execution overnight, precisely as in Mr. Krupp’s or Mr. von Stumm’s factory. And the example
      of these agricultural cooperatives would convince also the last of the still resistant small-holding peasants,
      and surely also many big peasants, of the advantages of cooperative, large-scale production.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch14--117"><a class="calibre14" id="ch14fn21"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch14fn21-r" id="ch14--119">21</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="indentt" id="ch14--120">
      Socialist thinking had followed these general lines, with differing details, for a half century and more. As we
      saw, this perspective for socialist agriculture had been included in the “Address to the Communist League” of
      March 1850.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch14--121"><a class="calibre14" id="ch14fn22"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch14fn22-r" id="ch14--123">22</a></sup> The Basel Congress of 1869 showed how popular it was. In Engels’
      already-mentioned comment on the Basel Congress, in his preface to an 1870 edition of <em class="calibre8" id="ch14--124">The
      Peasant War in Germany</em>, he made the same analogy as above between socialization of the factories and of the
      big landed estates; hence the land should be
    </div>
<div class="bq" id="ch14--125">
      withdrawn from the private ownership of the big peasants and the still bigger feudal lords, transformed into
      public property and cultivated by cooperative associations of agricultural workers on their common
      account.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch14--126"><a class="calibre14" id="ch14fn23"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch14fn23-r" id="ch14--128">23</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="indentt" id="ch14--129">
      Just as socialization could be carried out most easily both in the big factory and the big landed estate, so also
      the problem of the small peasant holding on the land was similar to that of the little artisan workshop in the
      town: it is the bigger enterprises which “are a better handle for us to take hold of,” wrote Engels to a German
      correspondent.
    </div>

      cultivation.</em> … I believe that this firebrand must be thrown among the agricultural day-laborers, and this
      can indeed be done in one of the many debates on state-socialism. This and this alone is the way to win the

      The proposal for large-scale operation of the land through agricultural cooperatives was by no means limited to
      rural laborers, however. It was also a possibility for peasants, insofar as the latter were weaned away from
      their historical obsession with “This is my own patch of dirt.” The laborers’ cooperatives could offer an example
      and a demonstration of the advantages. As the peasants flounder more and more in economic straits, we cannot vie
      with “the anti-Semites, peasant-leaguers and similar parties who derive pleasure from promising everything and

<a class="calibre6" id="page_415"></a>Engels gets most specific not in presenting some scheme of his own but in summarizing the
      agrarian plan proposed in the 1870s by the Danish socialists (and perhaps embroidering on it). The following
      passage is one of the most detailed pictures of some facet of economic policy in a socialist society ever written
      down by Marx or Engels; and it is ironic that it treats the allegedly ignored peasant question rather than
      industry. In Denmark—
    </div>
<div class="bq" id="ch14--151">
      The peasants of a village or parish … were to pool their land to form a single big farm in order to cultivate it
      for common account and distribute the yield in proportion to the land, money and labor contributed…. [I]f we
      apply this idea to a region of small holdings we shall find that if these are pooled and the aggregate area
      cultivated on a large scale, part of the labor power employed hitherto is rendered superfluous. It is precisely
      this saving of labor that represents one of the main advantages of large-scale farming. Employment can be found
      for this labor power in two ways. Either additional land taken from big estates in the neighborhood is placed at
      the disposal of the peasant cooperative or the peasants in question are provided with the means and the
      opportunity of engaging in industry as an accessory calling, primarily and as far as possible for their own use.
      In either case their economic position is improved and simultaneously the general social directing agency is
      assured the necessary influence to transform the peasant cooperative to a higher form, and to equalize the rights
      and duties of the cooperative as a whole as well as of its individual members with those of the other departments
      of the entire community. How this is to be carried out in practice in each particular case will depend upon the
      circumstances of the case and the conditions under which we take possession of political power. We may thus
      possibly be in a position to offer these cooperatives yet further advantages: assumption of their entire mortgage
      indebtedness by the national bank with a simultaneous sharp reduction of the interest rate; advances from public
      funds for the establishment of large-scale production (to be made not necessarily or primarily in money but in
      the form of required products: machinery, artificial fertilizer, etc.), and other advantages.

<div class="bqi2" id="ch14--152">
      The main point is and will be to make the peasants understand that we can save, preserve their houses and fields

      Engels made this proposal more briefly on other occasions, as in a series of popular articles for English workers

<h2 id="ch14lev3">3. FLEXIBILITY AND VARIATION</h2>
<div class="indent" id="ch14--175">
      So far this chapter has dealt with questions on which Marx held relatively fixed views, for the first involved
      the basic goal of socialism in agriculture, and the second involved the basic pattern of class priorities on
      socialized land. We now come to a number of questions involving the spectrum of <em class="calibre8" id="ch14--176">transitional
      measures</em> between capitalism and socialism.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch14--177">
      This is the area in which Marx and Engels not only allowed for but insisted on a wide-ranging flexibility.
      Flexibility was required by the general principle of “different countries—different cases,” as explained in the
      preceding chapter; it was also required because such historical circumstances as the way in which power was
      achieved could strongly condition the first measures taken by a workers’ state. Thus, while the goal of
      socialized agriculture on socially owned land was beyond question, the measures to be taken looking to the
      collectivization of land <a class="calibre6" id="page_417"></a>cultivation were a quite different matter. Let us cite two cases,
      one quite unequivocal in its answer, the other quite problematical.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch14--179">
      At the unequivocal end of the spectrum was a policy question of great political importance: the tenure of the
      small peasant. We have already seen more than one occasion on which Marx or Engels assumed or indicated in
      passing that the small peasants’ cultivation of their own patch of ground was not to be forcibly disrupted. In an
      1869 letter to Marx, Engels had remarked in the midst of another discussion: “Besides, it may of course be added
      that meanwhile the proletariat has no interest in raising the question of <em class="calibre8" id="ch14--180">small</em>
      landownership.”<sup class="calibre13" id="ch14--181"><a class="calibre14" id="ch14fn34"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch14fn34-r" id="ch14--183">34</a></sup> In his final essay on the peasant question, Engels came to dot the <em class="calibre8" id="ch14--184">i</em>’s: compulsory collectivization of the small peasants’ land was completely excluded:
    </div>
<div class="bq1" id="ch14--185">
      What, then, is our attitude towards the small peasantry? How shall we have to deal with it on the day of our
      accession to power?
    </div>
<div class="bqi2" id="ch14--186">
      To begin with, the French [party] program is absolutely correct in stating: that we foresee the inevitable doom
      of the small peasant but that it is not our mission to hasten it by any interference on our part.
    </div>
<div class="bqi2" id="ch14--187">
      Secondly, it is just as evident that when we are in possession of state power we shall not even think of forcibly
      expropriating the small peasants (regardless of whether with or without compensation), as we shall have to do in
      the case of the big landowners. Our task relative to the small peasant consists, in the first place, in effecting
      a transition of his private enterprise and private possession to cooperative ones, not forcibly but by dint of
      example and the proffer of social assistance for this purpose. And then of course we shall have ample means of
      showing to the small peasant prospective advantages that must be obvious to him even today.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch14--188"><a class="calibre14" id="ch14fn35"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch14fn35-r" id="ch14--190">35</a></sup>

    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch14--195">
      Socialists, Engels stressed, cannot promise the small peasants to <em class="calibre8" id="ch14--196">preserve</em> their property
      against capitalist encroachments, that is, against the inroads of economic forces they had been warned about. “We
      can only promise them,” writes Engels, “that we shall not interfere in their property relations by force, against
      their will.”<sup class="calibre13" id="ch14--197"><a class="calibre14" id="ch14fn37"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch14fn37-r" id="ch14--199">37</a></sup> When Kautsky made a similar statement in the party press, he was criticized for
      favoring peasant enterprise; and Engels was disgusted by this “wiseacreism.” He wrote to Kautsky: “To deduce,
      from the fact that we tell the small peasants we will not drive them forcibly from house and home, that we <a class="calibre6" id="page_418"></a>also want to provide them with the economic requisites for continued private enterprise—this is a
      bit thick after all. It is quite clear that, as things stand today, you would pose these two [propositions]
      differently.”<sup class="calibre13" id="ch14--201"><a class="calibre14" id="ch14fn38"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch14fn38-r" id="ch14--203">38</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="indent" id="ch14--204">
      The case of the big and middle peasants was, of course, different, not simply because they were bigger but
      because their operations depended on the use of wage-labor; in the case of big peasants or tenant-farmers, the
      actual producers were the laborers. If these peasant-growers draw the necessary conclusions, writes Engels, “it
      will be incumbent upon us to facilitate to the best of our ability also their transition to the changed mode of
      production…. Most likely we shall be able to abstain here as well from resorting to forcible expropriation, and
      as for the rest to count on future economic developments making also these harder pates amenable to
      reason.”<sup class="calibre13" id="ch14--205"><a class="calibre14" id="ch14fn39"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch14fn39-r" id="ch14--207">39</a></sup> We might add some obvious considerations, such as the fact that big peasants
      might have some difficulty in obtaining wage-labor if socialized agriculture offered a more attractive
      alternative to farmhands.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch14--208">
      Toward the other end of the spectrum are the questions subsumed under the later catchword, “Land to the
      peasants”—questions which we will sort out below. Here policy had to depend very much on the socioeconomic
      position and historical circumstances of the country and time; here national differences were often augmented by
      systemic differences.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch14--209">
      In one of his passages deprecating speculation about the details of the society of the future, Engels remarks
      that
    </div>
<div class="bq" id="ch14--210">
      Even the transitional measures will everywhere have to be in accordance with the relations existing at the
      moment. In countries of small landed property they will be substantially different from those in countries where

<div class="noindentt" id="ch14--214">
      In his 1894 essay he discusses the special agrarian program adopted by the French party at Nantes, in
      supplementation of the general party program. He reminds the French that the generalities in its preamble do not
      apply to the whole world:
    </div>
<div class="bq" id="ch14--215">
      Once we cite the program in support of our contention we must cite the entire program, which considerably
      modifies the proposition quoted in Nantes; for it makes the general historical truth expressed in it dependent
      upon the conditions under which alone <a class="calibre6" id="page_419"></a>it can remain a truth today in Western Europe and
      North America.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch14--217"><a class="calibre14" id="ch14fn41"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch14fn41-r" id="ch14--219">41</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="noindentt" id="ch14--220">
      So generalities will not do; in the next sections we shall have to tie the issues down to countries and periods.
      When we do so, we shall see that even a slogan like “Land to the peasants”—which, in the myths of marxology, is
      often supposed to be fundamentally incompatible with Marx’s views—was in fact an open question, depending on time
      and place.
    </div>
<h2 id="ch14lev4">4. FLEXIBILITY: IN AMERICA</h2>
<div class="indent" id="ch14--222">
      England and the United States are the most extreme cases, for here there was no class of peasantry overshadowing
      the land question as there was in most of the Continent. In both countries the question raised inside the
      proletarian movement was not that of sparing or preserving a small peasantry but of <em class="calibre8" id="ch14--223">creating</em> one where none existed. It should go without saying that Marx could not support such a
      plan for a moment; but it is all the more interesting to see his political approach to genuine mass movements
      that did propose this retrogressive step.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch14--224">
      This case occurred in the United States in 1846, while Marx and Engels were engaged in building their Communist
      Correspondence Committee in Brussels. A self-styled Communist named Hermann Kriege, a disciple of Wilhelm
      Weitling, had emigrated to America the year before. As editor of the <em class="calibre8" id="ch14--225">Volks-Tribun</em> and (at
      first) in the name of “Communism,” Kriege adopted whole the agrarian program of the American National Reformers
      for the salvation of the proletariat and of society: 160 acres of free land (no more) for everyone, establishing
      a population of small-holding cultivators and solving the problem of poverty forever-more.<a class="calibre6" id="ch14en6-r"></a><a class="nounder1" href="43.html#ch14en6" id="ch14--227">*</a>
</div>
<div class="indent" id="ch14--228">
<a class="calibre6" id="page_420"></a>In a circular on behalf of the Communist Correspondence Committee, Marx and Engels had no
      difficulty explaining why the 160-acre utopia was no economic solution for the ills of society, and demolishing
      Kriege’s Communist pretensions. But we must pay special attention to the political attitude they recommended
      toward the National Reformers and the Free Soil movement that put forward this very un-Communist program First
      this:
    </div>
<div class="bq1" id="ch14--230">
      We fully recognize the historical justification of the movement of the American National Reformers. We know that
      this movement aims at a state of affairs that right now would, to be sure, promote the industrialization of
      modern bourgeois society, but must drive onward to communism through its own consequences, as a result of a
      proletarian movement, as an attack on property in general, and in particular under the conditions presently
      existing in America.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch14--231"><a class="calibre14" id="ch14fn43"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch14fn43-r" id="ch14--233">43</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="noindentt" id="ch14--234">
      This was “the positive content of the movement”—of the American agrarian movement, not Kriege’s—and Marx was for
      taking full account of this positive side:
    </div>
<div class="bq1" id="ch14--235">
      If Kriege had conceived of the Free Soil movement as an initial form of the proletarian movement which was
      necessary under specific conditions, as a movement which must necessarily develop into a communist movement
      because of the conditions of life of the class from which it stems; if he had shown how the communist tendencies
      in America had to make their appearance at the beginning in this agrarian form which is apparently in
      contradiction with all communism, then there would have been nothing to say against it.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch14--236"><a class="calibre14" id="ch14fn44"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch14fn44-r" id="ch14--238">44</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="noindentt" id="ch14--239">
      But, continue Marx and Engels, Kriege did not take this flexible political attitude toward the mass movement
      while criticizing the formal programmatic aim it set; instead of considering it as an elementary and subordinate
      form of a proletarian movement, “he presents it as the highest, the ultimate goal of any movement in general, and
      thereby transforms the actual aim of the movement into sheer extravagant <a class="calibre6" id="page_421"></a>nonsense.” Indeed,
      Kriege adopted the peasant mentality, hailing the 160-acre homestead as the fulfillment at long last of the “old
      dreams of Europeans.”
    </div>
<div class="bq" id="ch14--241">
      Which Europeans are these, then [replied Marx and Engels], whose “dreams” are here fulfilled? Not the communist
      workers, but rather the bankrupt shopkeepers and artisans or ruined cotters who aspire to the good fortune of
      again becoming petty-bourgeois and peasants. And what kind of “desire” is this that is to be attained by means of
      the 1400 million acres? None other than transforming <em class="calibre8" id="ch14--242">everybody into private-property
      owners—</em>a desire which is just as feasible and just as communist as transforming everybody into emperors,
      kings and popes.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch14--243"><a class="calibre14" id="ch14fn45"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch14fn45-r" id="ch14--245">45</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="indentt" id="ch14--246">
      We observe, then, that without supporting the program of the land reform movement, Marx counseled a sympathetic
      approach to collaboration with it or in it, rather than simple negation—critical participation designed not to
      reinforce the illusions of the movement but to lead it in another direction as soon as it could be weaned away
      from those illusions.<a class="calibre6" id="ch14en7-r"></a><a class="nounder1" href="43.html#ch14en7" id="ch14--248">*</a> Later
      on, of course, the illusions became even less tenable: in the <em class="calibre8" id="ch14--249">Grundrisse</em> notebooks Marx
      remarked that in the United States the possibility of a worker’s accumulating enough to become, say, a
      tenant-farmer “is already now coming to an end.”<sup class="calibre13" id="ch14--250"><a class="calibre14" id="ch14fn47"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch14fn47-r" id="ch14--252">47</a></sup> But even in peasantless America, Marx looked to the
      land-tillers as allies; in 1877, for example, he was expecting that, under President Hayes, “the great
      expropriations of land (exactly of the fertile land) will turn the farmers of the West, who are already grumbling
      very loudly, into allied troops of the workers.”<sup class="calibre13" id="ch14--253"><a class="calibre14" id="ch14fn48"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch14fn48-r" id="ch14--255">48</a></sup> However, farmer-labor alliances in America were going to be a

<div class="indent" id="ch14--258">
      In England, a problem similar to that of the American agrarian reformers was raised by the “Land Plan” advocated
      by the Chartist leader Feargus O’Connor, who openly said that “Peasant proprietorship is the best basis of
      society.”<sup class="calibre13" id="ch14--259"><a class="calibre14" id="ch14fn49"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch14fn49-r" id="ch14--261">49</a></sup> Engels first mentioned the issue as follows:

      About two years ago [1845] the Chartist workers founded an association whose aim is to buy up landed property and
      distribute it among its members in small farms. The hope is in this way to lessen the excessive competition among
      the factory workers by removing a part of the workers from the labor market, to form a class of small peasants,

      That put the best face on it. The left Chartists, such as Harney and Ernest Jones (who were also closest to Marx
      and Engels), naturally took a dim view of the plan. Its sponsor, O’Connor, was not only the most prestigious
      leader of the movement but had also involved most of the Chartist executive in his National Land Company
      operation; therefore open opposition to the scheme was a delicate matter, capable of splitting the movement.
      Moreover, O’Connor himself was just then being made the butt of virulent attack and slander by the bourgeois
      world. Even Karl Schapper, then Marx’s and Engels’ associate in the Communist League, may have been caught up in
      the agrarian plan. (According to Schoyen: “the <em class="calibre8" id="ch14--267">Deutsche Londoner Zeitung</em>, in which
      Schapper’s influence was dominant, was unrestrained in its praise of the scheme.”<sup class="calibre13" id="ch14--268"><a class="calibre14" id="ch14fn51"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch14fn51-r" id="ch14--270">51</a></sup>)

<div class="indent" id="ch14--271">
      The above-quoted article on the land plan, which Engels wrote for the French press in 1847, was tactful,
      postponing a direct critique for “a more detailed account later,” but it clearly took the same line as in the
      Kriege case of the preceding year. The Chartist land society, wrote Engels,
    </div>
<div class="bq" id="ch14--272">
      has assumed such dimensions that it is already beginning to disturb the landed aristocracy; for it is clear that
      this movement, if it continues to grow in the same proportion as it has up to now, will end by being transformed
      into national agitation for the people’s taking possession of the national soil.
    </div>
<div class="noindentt" id="ch14--273">
      This is the programmatic crux of the article, making clear that the movement had a future only insofar as it
      adopted land nationalization <a class="calibre6" id="page_423"></a>as its goal, rather than the chimerical aim for which O’Connor
      had founded it. Meanwhile, Engels wrote, it was of significance as a class-struggle movement:

<div class="bq" id="ch14--275">
      The bourgeoisie does not like this society; it sees it as a lever in the hands of the people that will let them
      emancipate themselves without needing the help of the middle class. It is particularly the more or less liberal
      petty-bourgeoisie which glowers balefully at the land society, because it already finds the Chartists much more
      independent of its support than before the founding of the association.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch14--276"><a class="calibre14" id="ch14fn52"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch14fn52-r" id="ch14--278">52</a></sup>

      A couple of weeks later, writing to Marx from Paris, Engels referred less diplomatically to O’Connor’s

      of the Communist League, which came out in September, a note (probably written by Wilhelm Wolff, not Engels) gave
      the land scheme a brief treatment similar to Engels’, being a combination of pat and slap: “the sympathy it [the
      plan] meets with shows that the people earnestly want the liberation of the soil. Unfortunately O’Connor’s plan
      is based on the division of goods and not the community of goods.”<sup class="calibre13" id="ch14--287"><a class="calibre14" id="ch14fn55"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch14fn55-r" id="ch14--289">55</a></sup> Here, too, more is
      promised on the subject later. In any case, the Land Plan collapsed the following July. But O’Connor continued to
      push the aim, and in 1850 Marx and Engels published a last comment for its obituary:
    </div>
<div class="bq1" id="ch14--290">
      The main point of conflict between the two Chartist wings is the land question. O’Connor and his tendency would
      like to use the Charter to dispose part of the workers on small pieces of land and in the end make land
      parcellization the general pattern in England. We know how he tried and failed to establish such parcellization
      on a small scale through a joint-stock company. The tendency of every bourgeois revolution to break up
      large-scale landownership could make this parcellization look for a while like something revolutionary in the
      eyes of the English <a class="calibre6" id="page_424"></a>workers, although it is followed up as a rule by the unfailing tendency
      of the small property to get concentrated and be ruined in the face of big-scale agriculture. The revolutionary
      wing of the Chartists is against this demand for parcellization, counterposing the demand for the confiscation of
      all landed property, and demands that it not be divided but remain national property.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch14--292"><a class="calibre14" id="ch14fn56"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch14fn56-r" id="ch14--294">56</a></sup>

<div class="indentt" id="ch14--295">
      In these two cases—Kriege in America and O’Connor in England—there were different circumstances, but the main
      approach was common: the decisive criterion for Marx and Engels was that there was a real mass movement of class
      struggle going on behind the chimerical banner of Every Man a Peasant, and therefore it was the duty of the
      Communists to help this movement find its real program, not turn their backs on it.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch14--296"><a class="calibre14" id="ch14fn57"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch14fn57-r" id="ch14--298">57</a></sup>

<div class="indent" id="ch14--299">
      Another aspect of this problem was raised in Germany by the line of the <em class="calibre8" id="ch14--300">Neue Rheinische
      Zeitung</em> group during the 1848-1849 revolution; this is already suggested by the account given in the
      preceding chapter. There we saw that the <em class="calibre8" id="ch14--301">N.R.Z.</em>’s main thrust on the peasant question was
      the campaign against any indemnification of the landowners and for the complete liberation of the peasantry from
      all feudal obligations without any payments whatever. This meant making it as easy as possible for the peasant to
      get ownership and control of the land worked, even in a small parcel, and thus to become a completely free
      small-holder.<a class="calibre6" id="ch14en9-r"></a><a class="nounder1" href="43.html#ch14en9" id="ch14--303">*</a>
</div>
<div class="indent" id="ch14--304">
<a class="calibre6" id="page_425"></a>This would have meant strengthening the small peasantry—as against the landowners’ regime.
      Marx had no inhibitions against such a strengthening of the peasantry. The distinctive feature of his policy was
      that it permitted the following combinations: (1) complete support to and stimulation of the revolutionary
      potential of the peasantry as against the old ruling class, represented by the absolutist government and the
      aristocracy; and (2) <em class="calibre8" id="ch14--306">no</em> commitment to the peasantry to preserve their small-holding
      economy against the erosive pressures of modern society, that is, of industrializing capitalism. Thus Marx
      steered a course between the ever-present Scylla and Charybdis on the question of indemnification: he rejected,
      on the one hand, a negative attitude based on the principle one must do nothing to strengthen the class of
      small-holding peasants, that is, on sectarian grounds; and on the other hand he avoided the attractive course of
      currying peasant favor by identifying with the small-property aspirations of the peasants, that is, the
      opportunist course.

      If we leave the more highly industrialized or industrializing countries of Western Europe and America, and go

    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch14--318">
      Already two decades before, Marx was advocating a peasant-centered land program for Italy. The question came up
      in the Italian republican emigration in London, as it split over Mazzini’s policy of orienting <a class="calibre6" id="page_426"></a>toward the support of the upper classes rather than of the peasant masses. Marx strongly aligned
      himself with the opponents of Mazzini.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch14--320"><a class="calibre14" id="ch14fn63"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch14fn63-r" id="ch14--322">63</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="bq1" id="ch14--323">
      I consider Mazzini’s policy fundamentally wrong…. [H]e fails to appeal to the part of Italy oppressed for
      centuries, the peasants, and thus he prepares new resources for the counterrevolution. Mr. Mazzini knows only the
      cities with their liberal aristocracy and their <em class="calibre8" id="ch14--324">citoyens éclairés</em> [enlightened citizens].
      The material needs of the Italian country people—who are bled as white and are as systematically enervated and
      stultified as the Irish—are of course beneath notice for the pie-in-the-sky phrases of his
      cosmopolitan-neo-Catholic-idealist manifestoes. But, to be sure, it would have taken courage to tell the
      bourgeoisie and the aristocracy that the first step toward making Italy independent is the complete emancipation
      of the peasants and the transformation of their sharecropping system into free bourgeois property.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch14--325"><a class="calibre14" id="ch14fn64"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch14fn64-r" id="ch14--327">64</a></sup>

      Land to the peasants as their “free bourgeois property” was, for Marx, the precondition for mobilizing these

      question: “I intend to dwell on the material circumstances in which by far the greater portion of the rural
      inhabitants of that country are placed, and which have made them till now, if not reactionary, at least

<div class="indent" id="ch14--347">
      It was, then, no new departure when, about four decades later, Engels repeated the same advice to an Italian
      comrade. Antonio Labriola had written an article advocating the distribution of untilled land (<em class="calibre8" id="ch14--348">terra libera</em>) in Eritrea to Italian peasants. Engels agreed:
    </div>
<div class="bq1" id="ch14--349">
      As far as his <em class="calibre8" id="ch14--350">terra libera</em> is concerned, it is indeed the highest demand that one could
      make of the present Italian government, that it distribute the landed property to small peasants for cultivation
      by themselves, and not to the monopolists, individuals or companies, in the colonies. The small-peasant economy
      is the natural and best condition for the colonies established today by the bourgeois governments—on this, cf.
      Marx’s <em class="calibre8" id="ch14--351">Capital</em>, Vol. 1, last chapter, “The Modern Theory of Colonization.”<a class="calibre6" id="ch14en11-r"></a><a class="nounder1" href="43.html#ch14en11" id="ch14--353">*</a> We socialists can therefore in
      good conscience support the introduction of the small-peasant economy in already established colonies. But
      whether this will be carried out is another matter. All present-day governments are sold to and under the yoke of
      the financiers and stock-exchange to too great an extent to expect that the financial speculators will refrain
      from seizing the colonies for their own exploitation. But one can fight against this, even in the form of
      demanding that the government guarantee the same advantages to the Italian peasants emigrating there that they
      seek and largely find in Buenos Aires.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch14--354"><a class="calibre14" id="ch14fn70"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch14fn70-r" id="ch14--356">70</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="noindentt" id="ch14--357">
<a class="calibre6" id="page_428"></a>The proposal, then, Engels felt, would collide with the opposition of finance capital. This
      meant that, on the basis of a socialist demand for the distribution of available land for small peasant
      cultivation, the peasantry could be set into motion against the centers of capitalist power in Italy.

<div class="indent" id="ch14--359">
      Ireland, too, was geographically part of Western Europe, but, in terms of social development, leagues behind the
      capitalistically advanced countries. As we saw in the preceding chapter, what was on the order of the day was an
      agrarian revolution with an aim “concentrated exclusively on landed property,”<sup class="calibre13" id="ch14--360"><a class="calibre14" id="ch14fn71"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch14fn71-r" id="ch14--362">71</a></sup> but with an international
      impact that would be massively anticapitalist. This combination was decisive for Marx. There was no question but
      that at home the drive-wheel of the Irish revolution was the peasants’ aspiration to own the land they tilled.
      Marx energetically supported this Irish movement and its basic land demands as well as the fight for national
      independence, even while he was critical of its methods, such as conspiratorial terrorism; and under his guidance
      the International agitated in this spirit.

<div class="indent" id="ch14--363">
      This attitude was spelled out by Engels in response to an interviewer’s question, when he landed in New York on a
      visit to America in 1888. The interviewer was an old comrade, Theodor Cuno, representing the <em class="calibre8" id="ch14--364">New Yorker Volkszeitung.</em> Because of Americans’ intense interest in the Irish struggle, Engels
      was asked about the position of socialism in Ireland, and he answered:

      A purely socialist movement should not be expected from Ireland for some time. The people first want to become
      small landowning peasants, and when they do, the mortgages will come along and ruin them once again. In the

<div class="indent" id="ch14--373">
      When we come to Eastern Europe, Marx’s advocacy of the programmatic demand summarized by the later slogan “Land
      to the peasants” becomes heavily stressed. We find this true most often with reference to Poland, because of his
      frequent involvement with support of Polish national-revolutionary movements. But the position applied far more
      widely to the peasant countries of the Slavic east.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch14--374">
      Marx and Engels first gave public utterance to this programmatic view on Poland at a London meeting commemorating
      the Cracow uprising of 1846, held (as it happened) on the same day that the February revolution of 1848 was
      exploding on the other side of the Channel. The <em class="calibre8" id="ch14--375">Communist Manifesto</em> was coming off the
      press that same week, with its statement of support to the Polish revolutionary tendency “that insists on an
      agrarian revolution as the prime condition for national emancipation.”<sup class="calibre13" id="ch14--376"><a class="calibre14" id="ch14fn73"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch14fn73-r" id="ch14--378">73</a></sup> What would an agrarian
      revolution mean in Poland?
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch14--379">
      At the commemoration meeting, Marx’s speech stressed that it was a question of a social revolution in Poland, not
      merely a political one. But was the Cracow revolution “communist,” as has been claimed, asked Marx, just “because
      it tried to break the chains of feudalism, to liberate tributary property and transform it into free property,
      into modern property?” No, it was not communist, but nevertheless it aimed at a great social overturn.
    </div>
<div class="bq1" id="ch14--380">
      The men who were at the head of the Cracow revolutionary movement had the deep conviction that only a democratic
      Poland could be independent, and a Polish democracy was impossible without the abolition of feudal rights,
      without the agrarian movement which would transform the tribute-paying peasants into free property-owners, into
      modern property-owners. Put Polish aristocrats in the place of the Russian autocrat and you will have conferred
      naturalization papers on despotism.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch14--381"><a class="calibre14" id="ch14fn74"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch14fn74-r" id="ch14--383">74</a></sup>

<div class="noindentt" id="ch14--384">
      This transformation of the peasants into owners of the land they tilled was the economic content of the social
      overturn to come, and it was intertwined with the democratic and liberatory character of the Cracow movement:
      “The Cracow revolution has given a glorious example to all of Europe by identifying the cause of the nation with
      the cause of democracy and the liberation of the oppressed class.” Marx pointed to <a class="calibre6" id="page_430"></a>the close
      analogy with Ireland. This revolution, he said, “finds the confirmation of its principles in Ireland, where the
      narrowly national [i.e., nationalist] party has been buried with O’Connell and the new national party is above
      all reformatory and democratic.”<sup class="calibre13" id="ch14--386"><a class="calibre14" id="ch14fn75"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch14fn75-r" id="ch14--388">75</a></sup>

<div class="indent" id="ch14--391">
      Engels’ speech at the meeting stressed that the 1846 Cracow uprising was fundamentally different from the Warsaw
      revolt of 1830. In 1830 the Polish aristocracy had excluded three-quarters of the nation from the revolution:
      “They left intact the brutalizing servitude of the peasants and the infamous condition of the Jews.” They
      rejected Lelewel’s effort to unite the national cause with the cause of liberty “by emancipating the Jews and
      peasants, by having the peasants participate in the ownership of the soil, by reconstructing Poland on the basis
      of democracy and equality.” In contrast, in the Cracow uprising the revolutionists “attacked three powers at the
      same time; they proclaimed the freedom of the peasants, agrarian reform, the emancipation of the Jews, without
      for a moment worrying whether that might offend this or that aristocratic interest.”<sup class="calibre13" id="ch14--392"><a class="calibre14" id="ch14fn76"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch14fn76-r" id="ch14--394">76</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="indent" id="ch14--395">
      The following characteristic of Marx’s and Engels’ approach cannot be overemphasized: the land issue (land to the
      peasants, to begin with) was weighed not simply as an element in a certain agrarian program, but as an
      inextricable part of an international struggle for the overthrow of autocracy in Eastern Europe and the
      democratization of the social system.

      Less than two months later, Marx and Engels were in Cologne. Throughout the revolution, the question of Poland
      was alive in Germany, for Prussia held a part of Poland alongside its partition partners, Russia and Austria. The
      Frankfurt assembly kept debating policy, and the <em class="calibre8" id="ch14--397">Neue Rheinische Zeitung</em> kept denouncing
      it for holding on to Polish territory. Most important was a series of articles by Engels published in August and
      September of 1848, in which he dotted a number of <em class="calibre8" id="ch14--398">i</em>’s.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch14--399">
      The Poles, wrote Engels, understand that their national independence is inseparable “from the overthrow of the
      aristocracy and agrarian reform internally.” He spelled this out for all of East Europe:
    </div>
<div class="bq1" id="ch14--400">
      The big agricultural lands between the Baltic and the Black Sea can escape from patriarchal-feudal barbarism only
      through an <a class="calibre6" id="page_431"></a>agrarian revolution which transforms the enserfed or corvée-burdened peasants
      into free landowners, a revolution which is altogether the same as the French Revolution in the countryside. The
      Polish nation has the merit of being the first to proclaim this, among all the neighboring agricultural peoples….
      And especially since the Cracow uprising of 1846, the struggle for the independence of Poland has at the same
      time been the struggle for <em class="calibre8" id="ch14--402">agrarian democracy—</em>the only one possible in East
      Europe—against patriarchal-feudal absolutism.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch14--403"><a class="calibre14" id="ch14fn77"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch14fn77-r" id="ch14--405">77</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="noindentt" id="ch14--406">
      The social content of “agrarian democracy” was the free ownership of his land by the peasant. “Wherein,” asked
      Engels, “lies the inexorable and iron necessity for Poland to regain its freedom?” In the fact that aristocratic
      rule is obsolete, and also
    </div>
<div class="bq" id="ch14--407">
      in the fact that the establishment of agrarian democracy for Poland has become a vital question not only
      politically but also socially; in the fact that the Polish people’s source of existence, agriculture, is headed
      for ruin if the peasant who is enserfed or liable for labor-service does not become a free landowner …
    </div>
<div class="noindentt" id="ch14--408">
      Therefore the Poland of the aristocracy must be replaced by “the Poland of the <em class="calibre8" id="ch14--409">peasant</em>
      democracy.”<sup class="calibre13" id="ch14--410"><a class="calibre14" id="ch14fn78"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch14fn78-r" id="ch14--412">78</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="indent" id="ch14--413">
      The position applies to all Slavdom: Engels repeats this with marked emphasis. “The merit of the Poles,” he
      reiterates toward the end of the series, “lies in the fact that they were the first to recognize and popularize
      agrarian democracy as the sole possible form of liberation for all Slavic nations …”<sup class="calibre13" id="ch14--414"><a class="calibre14" id="ch14fn79"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch14fn79-r" id="ch14--416">79</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="indent" id="ch14--417">
      A quarter century later, there was another occasion when Engels spelled out the agrarian content of the Polish
      revolution. A group of Polish revolutionary émigrés in London had issued an “Address to the English People,” on
      the occasion of the czar’s visit to England in 1874; Engels wrote it up for the German party press. He begins
      with extensive and approving quotations from the Polish address; one of the passages recalled that the Cracow
      manifesto proclaimed “the proposition that <em class="calibre8" id="ch14--418">the peasants should become owners of the soil</em>
      which they have cultivated for centuries.” Further on, Engels emphasizes that the great merit of the Polish
      revolutionary movements of 1846 and 1863 was this:
    </div>
<div class="bq" id="ch14--419">
      These movements were not only national [ist]; they were simultaneously aimed directly toward the liberation of
      the peasants and the transference of landed property to the latter. In 1871 the great mass of the Polish
      emigration in France entered the service <a class="calibre6" id="page_432"></a>of the Commune … Doesn’t this prove that these
      Poles stand altogether abreast of the modern movement?<sup class="calibre13" id="ch14--421"><a class="calibre14" id="ch14fn80"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch14fn80-r" id="ch14--423">80</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="noindentt" id="ch14--424">
      Once again, then, a double emphasis, especially for an audience that looked on the Polish movement as a matter of
      nationalism only: national liberation meant social revolution at home (land to the peasants) and stimulation of
      revolution on the international scale. It follows that the simple peasant demand must be assessed in terms larger
      than the agrarian question itself.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch14--425">
      The national-liberation element was not a necessity for this complex of agrarian revolution and international
      social revolution; it was an added source of dynamism in Poland. It was not present, of course, in the Russian
      case. Just as Marx and Engels discussed this programmatic demand only in connection with live revolutionary
      movements in Poland, so also they did <em class="calibre8" id="ch14--426">not</em> discuss it specifically for Russia, where there
      was as yet no movement to raise it.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch14--427">
      As far as its application to Russia was concerned, the only element of dubiety for a while was the Populist claim
      that the Russian peasant had a special affinity for communistic organization because of the village-commune
      (artel) tradition. Marx was usually willing to leave open the question whether the Russian peasantry might go
      directly from the artel to socialized agriculture, in the context of a general social revolution. Even so, in
      1881, as he tried, to draft a letter to Zasulich on the possibility of the direct transition, we can see the
      “Land to the peasants” idea in his line of thought.<a class="calibre6" id="ch14en12-r"></a><a class="nounder1" href="43.html#ch14en12" id="ch14--429">*</a>
</div>
<div class="indent" id="ch14--430">
<a class="calibre6" id="page_433"></a>But by the 1890s Engels, like the nascent group of Russian Marxists, cast the Populist claim
      aside entirely, as outlived. More than ever, the “struggle for agrarian democracy, against patriarchal-feudal
      absolutism” was “the only one possible in East Europe.”<sup class="calibre13" id="ch14--432"><a class="calibre14" id="ch14fn83"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch14fn83-r" id="ch14--434">83</a></sup>

<h2 id="ch14lev8">8. IMMEDIATE PROGRAMS</h2>
<div class="indent" id="ch14--436">
      Let us now turn back from peasant countries (countries with a peasant majority) to Western Europe, particularly
      France and Germany, above all because here Engels, near the end of his life, had to deal with the peasant
      question in a context that was vital to the future of the socialist movement.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch14--437">
      This peasant question asked: <em class="calibre8" id="ch14--438">How do we socialists get the support of the peasantry
      now—</em>right now, this minute? In 1848 and 1871 Marx and Engels had to deal with this question in the midst of
      a revolutionary situation; in 1894 Engels had to deal with it for quite different reasons.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch14--439">
      The first special peasant program drawn up by Marx and Engels figured as part of the “Demands of the Communist
      Party of Germany” in March 1848; it was described in <a class="nounder1" href="21.html#ch13" id="ch14--440">Chapter 13</a>. Put together on the basis of little previous experience right after the outbreak
      of the revolution, it was directed to an existing revolutionary situation—unlike most peasant programs. As we
      saw, one of its points (no indemnification for the abolition of feudal burdens) turned out to be the mainspring
      of peasant activity in 1848-1849.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch14--441">
      The second time Marx worked out something like a detailed program of peasant demands was also designed for a
      revolutionary situation, this time <em class="calibre8" id="ch14--442">ex post facto.</em> In <em class="calibre8" id="ch14--443">The Civil War in
      France</em> Marx devoted a section to discussing what the Paris Commune should have done, or might have done, to
      gain peasant support, and what this would have meant for the revolution; it is an informal programmatic
      presentation, derived in part <a class="calibre6" id="page_434"></a>from his reading of the Commune press and in part from his own
      judgment and experience. This section is longer in Marx’s first draft of the Address than in the very much
      condensed version that was published in the name of the International.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch14--445">
      Following this draft, here is a summary of the way in which, Marx argues, the peasant will benefit from the
      victory of the Commune, why the Commune “represents above all the interest of the <em class="calibre8" id="ch14--446">French
      peasantry.”</em>
</div>
<div class="indent" id="ch14--447">
      1. The Commune will save the peasant from the burden of paying for the cost of the war, particularly the heavy
      indemnity to be paid the Prussians; it will make “the authors of the war”—the bourgeois, the rich landowners, and
      their state agents—do the paying.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch14--448">
      2. The Commune will abolish conscription, the “blood-tax on the peasant”; for peasant sons were the main source
      of cannon-fodder.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch14--449">
      3. It will provide cheaper government, rather than heavier taxes “for the payment of a parasitical and costly
      state-machinery.”
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch14--450">
      4. It “will free him of the incubus of the mortgages,” whereas the bourgeoisie will continue to “grind down” the
      peasant through the usurer.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch14--451">
      5. It will abolish the bureaucratic legal apparatus (“the parasitical judiciary body”) which gets rich from
      milking the peasant—“the notary, the huissier [bailiff], etc.” Since Commune officials will get only “workmen’s
      salaries,” “it will break down this whole judiciary cobweb which entangles the French peasant.” (The published
      Address summed it up this way: The Commune “would have … transformed his present blood-suckers, the notary,
      advocate [lawyer], executor, and other judicial vampires, into salaried communal agents, elected by, and
      responsible to, himself.”)
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch14--452">
      6. The bourgeoisie will keep the peasant “under the rule of the gendarme, the Commune will restore him to
      independent, social and political life.”
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch14--453">
      7. The Commune would confer enlightenment by the schoolteacher; the bourgeoisie, “stultification by the rule of
      the priest.” Priests would be paid by voluntary contributions only, not by state taxes.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch14--454"><a class="calibre14" id="ch14fn84"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch14fn84-r" id="ch14--456">84</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="indent" id="ch14--457">
      At this point there is a noteworthy difference between the draft and the published Address. In the draft there
      follows a section presenting a socialist solution, looking to replace small-scale production with “associated”
      (socialized) production. This section is omitted in the Address (which, of course, was to be signed by the
      General Council). The <a class="calibre6" id="page_435"></a>program as it stands consists only of immediate benefits. It is only
      in a separate, preceding passage that Marx explains that the Commune “intended” to abolish capitalist property,
      and it is in this passage on the ultimate aims that he includes “transforming the means of production, land and
      capital” into instruments of “associated labor,” that is, social ownership.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch14--459"><a class="calibre14" id="ch14fn85"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch14fn85-r" id="ch14--461">85</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="indent" id="ch14--462">
      As a result, the emphasis in the published Address is overwhelmingly on the immediate advantages the peasants
      would gain from the Commune. On the other hand, the draft is even more explicit in pledging no expropriation of
      the peasant. Here is the summary in the draft:
    </div>
<div class="bq" id="ch14--463">
      °°If the Commune, as we have shown, is the only power that can give him [the peasant] immediate great loans
      [boons?]<sup class="calibre13" id="ch14--464"><a class="calibre14" id="ch14fn86"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch14fn86-r" id="ch14--466">86</a></sup> even in its present economical conditions, it is the only form of government
      that can secure to him the transformation of his present economical conditions, rescue him from expropriation by
      the landlord on the one hand, save him from grinding, [d]rudging and misery on the pretext of proprietorship on
      the other, that can convert his nominal proprietorship of the land into real proprietorship of the fruits of his
      labour, that can combine for him the profits of modern agronomy, dictated by social wants and every day now
      encroaching upon him as a hostile agency, without annihilating his position as a really independent producer.
      Being immediately benefited by Communal Republic, he would soon confide in it [trust it].<sup class="calibre13" id="ch14--467"><a class="calibre14" id="ch14fn87"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch14fn87-r" id="ch14--469">87</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="indent" id="ch14--470">
      This discussion of the possibilities of an appeal to the peasants by the Commune was, however, too much <em class="calibre8" id="ch14--471">ad hoc—</em>situation-linked and conjunctural—to be of general value as a guide. In this field as in
      many others, Marx and Engels preferred to address themselves to systematic analysis of a question only when a
      real political situation demanded it. This did not come about until the 1890s. But in 1874-1875 Marx at least had
      occasion to note the nature of the need, in the course of marginal comments on a polemic published by Bakunin.
      The latter, with his usual gay abandon to slander and his delightful disregard of the authoritarian demands of
      evidence, had charged that the “Marxists” want the proletariat to dominate the “common peasant folk,” and
      therefore want the Germans to dominate the Slavs. The social revolution—Marx scribbled on the side—is “possible
      only where, along with capitalist production, the industrial proletariat occupies at least an <a class="calibre6" id="page_436"></a>important position among the mass of people.” But if the proletariat itself is not yet a majority
      of the people, it must gain the support of allies:
    </div>
<div class="bq" id="ch14--473">
      And in order for it to have any chance of victory at all, it must at least be able to do immediately as much for
      the peasants, <em class="calibre8" id="ch14--474">mutatis mutandis</em>, as the French bourgeoisie did in its own revolution for
      the French peasants of that time. What a nice idea, that labor rule involves oppression of rural labor!<sup class="calibre13" id="ch14--475"><a class="calibre14" id="ch14fn88"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch14fn88-r" id="ch14--477">88</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="indent" id="ch14--478">
      The word <em class="calibre8" id="ch14--479">immediately</em>, here again, means: immediately on gaining power. More often, of
      course, <em class="calibre8" id="ch14--480">immediate demands</em> suggests demands raised for adoption by the present regime. The
      difference is by no means absolute: on the one hand, a revolutionary party would presumably carry out in power
      the demands it raises in opposition; on the other, peasants are afraid to trust socialists in the present because
      of their fear of future expropriation. In his 1894 essay on “The Peasant Question in France and Germany,” Engels
      discussed the whole complex of immediate policy under these several questions:
    </div>
<div class="bq" id="ch14--481">
      How is Social-Democracy to overcome this [peasant] prejudice? What can it offer to the doomed small peasant
      without becoming untrue to itself? …
    </div>
<div class="bq" id="ch14--482">
      How was the peasant to be helped, not the peasant as a future proletarian but as a present propertied peasant,
      without violating the basic principles of the general socialist program? …
    </div>
<div class="bqi" id="ch14--483">
      What, then, is our attitude toward the small peasantry? How shall we have to deal with it on the day of our
      accession to power?<sup class="calibre13" id="ch14--484"><a class="calibre14" id="ch14fn89"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch14fn89-r" id="ch14--486">89</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="noindent" id="ch14--487">
      In the 1890s these issues were raised sharply as a concrete <em class="calibre8" id="ch14--488">party</em> problem.

<h2 id="ch14lev9">9. “THE PEASANT QUESTION IN FRANCE AND GERMANY”</h2>
<div class="indent" id="ch14--490">
      The impulsion that led Engels to write “The Peasant Question” was the development especially in the French and
      German parties of what he considered an opportunist (reformist) tendency that was seriously <a class="calibre6" id="page_437"></a>compromising socialist principles in order to “catch the peasant.”<a class="calibre6" id="ch14en13-r"></a><a class="nounder1" href="43.html#ch14en13" id="ch14--493">*</a>
</div>
<div class="indent" id="ch14--494">
      In France, the Marxist group, called the French Workers Party, was one of seven socialist groups at this time.
      Led by Jules Guesde and Paul Lafargue, it was making progress slowly. Lafargue and his wife Laura (Marx’s
      daughter) kept in regular correspondence with Engels. In 1891 Lafargue won election to the Chamber of Deputies
      from the Lille area, making a first for the party. Given the majority mass of the rural population, further party
      progress meant extending socialist propaganda and organization to the countryside. In 1892 the party’s first
      agrarian program was adopted at its Marseilles congress; this program dealt mainly with the interests of the
      agricultural laborers, tenants, and sharecroppers, and seemed to be effective in gaining rural support.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch14--495">
      Then in 1893 Lafargue was defeated for reelection. He wrote Engels: “I had a majority in the town of Lille, it
      was the votes of the sixteen rural areas which gave my opponent the majority.”<sup class="calibre13" id="ch14--496"><a class="calibre14" id="ch14fn92"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch14fn92-r" id="ch14--498">92</a></sup> In October he reported to
      Engels that “The winning of the rural areas is the Socialists’ main objective, even though the towns are far from
      being won,” and that additions to the party’s agrarian program were being prepared for
    </div>
<div class="bq" id="ch14--499">
      the next congress, which will be specially devoted to the agrarian question and will be held at Nantes, in the
      heart of the Chouan country [center of peasant counterrevolution in 1793], where the Republic is still not
      accepted, but where rural socialism is making headway … The Nantes Socialists, who have a rich ship-owner,
      Brunellière, at their head, have organized the peasants in unions which centralize and coordinate their efforts;
      so far they have succeeded in deferring the expropriation of the peasants.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch14--500"><a class="calibre14" id="ch14fn93"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch14fn93-r" id="ch14--502">93</a></sup>

<div class="noindent" id="ch14--503">
      It was the big landowners who were trying to get the small peasants off the land. The peasant “unions” were
      peasant organizations formed to preserve the small holdings.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch14--504">
<a class="calibre6" id="page_438"></a>In September 1894 the party congress at Nantes did adopt an expanded agrarian program which
      was obviously designed to make a new type of appeal to the small-holding peasantry and even to bigger landholders
      employing farm laborers. This is the Nantes program discussed below.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch14--506">
      There was no doubt in Engels’ mind that the decisive motivation was simply “vote-catching” for electoral success.
      The party “did such good business” among peasants with the Marseilles planks that, “since appetite comes with
      eating,” it was moved to increase its wares.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch14--507"><a class="calibre14" id="ch14fn94"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch14fn94-r" id="ch14--509">94</a></sup> After talking to a leading party writer and Guesde

      necessary to gain over the mass of the French peasants to socialism between now and the next general
      elections.”<sup class="calibre13" id="ch14--513"><a class="calibre14" id="ch14fn96"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch14fn96-r" id="ch14--515">96</a></sup> The ensuing years, especially up to 1898, were to show that this was not simply
      an aberration on the peasant question but rather the first big manifestation of the devolution of the party
      toward parliamentary reformism.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch14--516"><a class="calibre14" id="ch14fn97"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch14fn97-r" id="ch14--518">97</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="indent" id="ch14--519">
      A similar development was taking place in the German party, with a difference. While in France the entire party
      leadership was moving in this direction with some circumspection, in Germany a cruder form of opportunist
      peasant-catching had been adopted by one wing, which however constituted the leadership of the party in South
      Germany, especially Bavaria. The leader of this tendency, Georg von Vollmar, whose bailiwick was Upper Bavaria,
      was the real founder of the reformist movement in the German Social-Democracy. (Eduard Bernstein came along a
      little later to provide a theoretical rationale for the process.)
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch14--520">
      Thus in Germany, too, the process of parliamentary degeneration in the party broke out first on the peasant
      question, and for essentially the same reason: the need to win a mass source of votes for immediate electoral
      success. Unlike the French, however, Vollmar very quickly extended his theoretical views from the special
      question of the agrarian program to advocating the general transformation of socialism into a movement of
      gradualist social reform.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch14--521">
      The German leader, Bebel,
    </div>
<div class="bq" id="ch14--522">
      complains with reason [wrote Engels] that the party is going bourgeois. That is the misfortune of all extreme
      parties when the time approaches for them to become “possible.” But our party cannot go beyond a certain limit in
      this respect without betraying itself, and it seems to me that in France as in Germany we have <a class="calibre6" id="page_439"></a>now reached that point. Fortunately there is still time to call a halt.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch14--524"><a class="calibre14" id="ch14fn98"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch14fn98-r" id="ch14--526">98</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="noindent" id="ch14--527">
      Calling a halt became even more imperative when the German party congress met at Frankfurt in October 1894, a
      month after Nantes. Vollmar not only came out more boldly for a reformist peasant policy but also publicly
      stated—falsely—that Engels himself had expressly approved the French decisions at Nantes. This news was repeated
      in the bourgeois press. Engels then felt compelled to come out with a public criticism of the new
      peasant-catching opportunism on both sides of the Rhine—reluctantly, because of the burden of working on his own
      and Marx’s writings. (He also had less than a year to live, as it turned out.)
    </div>
<div class="indentb" id="ch14--528">
      First he published a letter in the party organ repudiating Vollmar’s false statement. Since this letter offers a
      brief preview of two of the issues, we quote it here. Engels related that he had sent only two comments on the
      Nantes program to French comrades. There was one before the congress, which he summarizes as follows:
    </div>
<div class="alpha-list" id="ch14--529">
      The development of capitalism irretrievably destroys small-peasant landownership. Our party is entirely clear on
      that, but it has absolutely no reason to hasten this process still more by its own intervention. In principle one
      can take no exception to correctly selected measures which would make the inevitable ruin of the small peasants
      less painful; if you go further than that, if you want to sustain the small peasant permanently, then in my
      opinion you are trying to do what is economically impossible, sacrificing principle, and becoming reactionary.

      Before the month was up, Engels had written “The Peasant Question in France and Germany,” and it was published in
      the party theoretical journal. We have already quoted extensively from this essay on a number of questions
      discussed up to this point. It was the last word on the view of the peasant question which Marx and Engels had
      been developing over a span of a half century.

<h2 id="ch14lev10"><a class="calibre15" id="page_440"></a>10. PROGRAMMATIC ISSUES: PRINCIPLE AND PRACTICALITY</h2>
<div class="indent" id="ch14--538">
      Engels wholeheartedly accepts the immediacy of the peasant problem. He rejects the approach that sees the
      political problem solved by the predicted decline of the small peasantry and its proletarianization:
    </div>
<div class="bq" id="ch14--539">
      The greater the number of peasants whom we can save from being actually hurled down into the proletariat, whom we
      can win to our side while they are still peasants, the more quickly and easily the social transformation will be
      accomplished.
    </div>
<div class="noindent" id="ch14--540">
      For then the party will have the support of at least a cadre of peasant revolutionists who will facilitate the
      social revolution on the land. And—
    </div>
<div class="bq" id="ch14--541">
      It will serve us nought to wait with this transformation until capitalist production has developed everywhere to
      its utmost consequences, until the last small handicraftsman and the last small peasant have fallen victim to
      capitalist large-scale production.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch14--542"><a class="calibre14" id="ch14fn100"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch14fn100-r" id="ch14--544">100</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="noindent" id="ch14--545">
      Rather, whatever expenditure of effort is devoted to easing the peasants’ lot, and easing them into a
      relationship of confidence, is “an excellent investment because it will effect a perhaps tenfold saving in the
      cost of the social reorganization in general. In this sense we can, therefore, afford to deal very liberally with
      the peasants.”
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch14--546">
      This rejects, also, two other approaches that were known to the socialist movement: the crudely sectarian
      approach (“The business of revolutionists is to advocate revolution and nothing else”) and <em class="calibre8" id="ch14--547">ouvriérisme</em> or proletarianism (“the business of a proletarian movement is to be concerned only
      with proletarians”). But outside of such infantile-leftist tendencies, the mainstream of the socialist movement
      was certainly in favor of winning the rural population. <em class="calibre8" id="ch14--548">Winning whom to what, how, at what
      cost?</em>
</div>
<div class="indent" id="ch14--549">
      The political differences involved will be exhibited through a discussion of eight questions, taken within the
      framework of the peasant question. But we must keep in mind that this problem complex arose at this time as proxy
      for a general trend to parliamentary reformism. In more than one area, the increasingly conscious reformist wing
      was overlaying questions of principle with its own favorite problem-posing approach: (1) How can our party be
      practical, realistic, and above all <a class="calibre6" id="page_441"></a>successful in winning elections, instead of visionary,
      utopian, romantic, and above all small? (2) In line with this high aspiration, what really attractive measures
      can we propose to the peasants that will achieve the aims <em class="calibre8" id="ch14--551">they</em> want to vote for? The
      latter measures were termed <em class="calibre8" id="ch14--552">practical.</em> In reading Engels’ “Peasant Question,” one must
      understand that there is often an undercurrent of polemic on the meaning of practical politics, that is,
      opportunist adaptation to short-term gains. If the reformists plumed themselves on their sober practicality,
      Engels was often intent on stressing that the reformist planks, while practically giving up socialist principles,
      had no really practical and lasting solution for the rescue of a peasantry struggling to stay afloat in a sea of
      capitalism and mortgages.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch14--553">
      Here then are critical issues raised in “The Peasant Question.”
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch14--554">
      1. <em class="calibre8" id="ch14--555">What exactly do you wish to convince the peasant to do?</em>
</div>
<div class="indent" id="ch14--556">
      One or another peasant might be persuaded to (a) join the socialist party; (b) vote for its candidates; (c) at
      least carry on a militant fight against the government, preferably in alliance with the working-class movement;
      (d) move close enough to socialism so that, in a revolutionary situation, the upsurge would carry him over to the
      socialist side; (e) lose enough anti-socialist prejudice so that, in a revolutionary situation, he would at least
      be neutralized.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch14--557">
      These different levels of achievement are basic to understanding the difference between Engels’ approach and that
      of the reformists. For the reformists, the first two (a, b) are everything, the crux being the acquisition of
      peasant votes; the last two (d, e) are nothing; and there would be a sliding scale of interest in (c). For
      Engels, the decisive achievement is represented by the last two (d, e) in the sense that all efforts are fully
      justified even if these are the sole results. When peasant struggle (c) is stimulated in addition, the cup
      runneth over. The value of a cadre of supporters among the peasantry (a, b) could be great as a means of
      achieving the other goals. And finally: whereas the reformists regarded the amassment of peasant votes as
      requiring peasant party members to herd them to the polls, Engels regarded peasant membership in the party as a
      good only in a limited quantity—like starch in the diet. (We will come back to this.)
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch14--558">
      2. <em class="calibre8" id="ch14--559">To which peasants are you directing your appeal? Which sections of the rural population are
      you most interested in winning over?</em>
</div>
<div class="indent" id="ch14--560">
      We saw Marx’s and Engels’ answer in <a class="nounder1" href="21.html#ch13" id="ch14--561">Chapter 13</a>.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch14--562"><a class="calibre14" id="ch14fn101"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch14fn101-r" id="ch14--564">101</a></sup>
      First comes the rural proletariat—the wage-workers on the land—and then the small <a class="calibre6" id="page_442"></a>peasantry.
      But organizing the agricultural laborers means organizing them against their employers, who are often big and
      even middle peasants, not only big landowners. Therefore there is a basic question of priorities: the rural
      proletariat is most important to the socialist movement, most easily won, and so on. And there is the basic
      question of the class line of exploitation: productive labor versus exploiters of labor. Aside from unusual
      individuals as always, it is not possible for a revolutionary party to englobe both the classes that live by
      productive labor and also the classes that live by exploiting the latter. This combination literally injects the
      class struggle into the ranks of the party itself, and the difficulty cannot be conjured away by denying the
      existence of the class struggle philosophically.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch14--566">
      At the Marseilles congress two years before Nantes, the French had adopted a program not only for small peasants
      but also for “propertyless rural <em class="calibre8" id="ch14--567">workers</em>,” Engels’ article reminds. The demands started
      with “minimum wages fixed by trade unions and community councils,” and went on.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch14--568"><a class="calibre14" id="ch14fn102"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch14fn102-r" id="ch14--570">102</a></sup> Experience shows that
      it is often easier to win such demands from big capitalist interests than from little micro-employers who are
      scratching for sustenance themselves. In any case, such demands can be realized only in struggle against small
      employers as well as big landowners. Whom would the party take under its wing?
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch14--571">
      The problem was brought up not so much by the demands in the Nantes program as by the “theoretical preamble” to
      the program, and it is against the ideas in the preamble that Engels directs his primary attack. The role of the
      preamble was permissive; the French did not—as yet—overtly draw the logical conclusions from their generalities,
      but the South German reformists did.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch14--572">
      The Nantes preamble came out for protecting not only the small peasants but also tenant farmers “who, if they
      exploit day-laborers, are to a certain extent compelled to do so because of the exploitation to which they
      themselves are subjected.”<sup class="calibre13" id="ch14--573"><a class="calibre14" id="ch14fn103"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch14fn103-r" id="ch14--575">103</a></sup> It is the typical viewpoint of the petty-bourgeois small producer or
      shopkeeper: “Please don’t object if I have to exploit you, because look at all the troubles <em class="calibre8" id="ch14--576">I</em> have!” If harassed employers are “compelled” to exploit their hands, they touch the
      fellow-feelings of reformists who are so eager to give employers protection against the vicissitudes of a society
      dominated by big capital; and if their laborers organized to better their conditions at the employers’ <a class="calibre6" id="page_443"></a>expense, they would surely be showing a lamentable lack of practicality.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch14--578">
      The Nantes preamble also proclaimed a principle which, if applied to the rest of society, would have scrapped
      socialism completely: the party’s aim was “to bring together all the elements of rural production, all
      occupations which by virtue of various rights and titles utilize the national soil, to wage an identical struggle
      against the common foe: the feudality of landownership.”<sup class="calibre13" id="ch14--579"><a class="calibre14" id="ch14fn104"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch14fn104-r" id="ch14--581">104</a></sup> The principle is the solidarity of all rural
      classes, exploiters and exploited, against a common foe, and the common foe is not even capitalism on the land
      but rather the enemy of capitalism, the obsolescent remains of the precapitalist ruling class. A party that
      carried out such principles consistently could expect not only to catch a few peasants but also a few more rich
      ship-owners. As yet, the theoretical content of the preamble did not show up in the program—except for one
      plank.<a class="calibre6" id="ch14en14-r"></a><a class="nounder1" href="43.html#ch14en14" id="ch14--583">*</a>
</div>
<div class="indent" id="ch14--584">
      But in South Germany the Social-Democrats were acting it out in practical politics. They gave priority to winning
      over the bigger peasants, not the small working peasants and not the farm laborers. As Engels reported to a
      friend:
    </div>
<div class="bq" id="ch14--585">
      … Vollmar comes along in Frankfurt [party congress of 1894] and wants to bribe the <em class="calibre8" id="ch14--586">peasantry

      the Rhineland, but the middle and even the big peasant, who exploits male and female farm-hands and sells cattle
      and grain in quantity. And that cannot be done without giving up the whole principle. We can win over the Alpine
      peasants and the Lower Saxon and Schleswig-Holstein big peasants only if we sacrifice the field-hands and
      day-laborers to them, and in doing that we lose more politically than we gain.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch14--587"><a class="calibre14" id="ch14fn106"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch14fn106-r" id="ch14--589">106</a></sup>

      <a class="calibre6" id="page_444"></a>budget as a whole in the Bavarian Diet; and in particular Vollmar had organized a peasant
      campaign to rope in the Upper Bavarian big-peasant crowd who own 25 to 80 acres of land (10 to 30 hectares) and
      who therefore <em class="calibre8" id="ch14--594">cannot get along at all without wage-laborers—but not their
      farmhands</em>.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch14--595"><a class="calibre14" id="ch14fn107"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch14fn107-r" id="ch14--597">107</a></sup>

      The appellation “People’s Party” is intended to recall the typical petty-bourgeois democratic party—the South
      German People’s Party— which the socialists (especially Wilhelm Liebknecht) had clung to for so long before they
      were pushed to establish an independent socialist party in a break with it. It specialized in keeping a
      working-class wing in suspension under the domination of bourgeois reformers. Now the Bavarian reformists were
      repackaging the same combination under the label of a socialist party.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch14--599">
      From Engels’ standpoint, the dispute was not over practical ways of winning the peasant to socialism but over the

      3. <em class="calibre8" id="ch14--601">Do you tell the peasants the truth (as you see it) about their position under capitalism,

      with Engels’ lively agreement, that “still it is not for socialism to hasten this doom” which is the work of
      capitalist forces. Yet in the next paragraph, after a confused <em class="calibre8" id="ch14--605">whereas</em>, it proclaims that
      it is the socialists’ “imperative duty to maintain the peasants themselves tilling their patches of land in
      possession of the same as against the fisk, the usurer, and the encroachments of the newly arisen big
      landowners”—and this is even followed by the extension of the same protection to labor exploiters, as we have

<div class="indent" id="ch14--609">
<a class="calibre6" id="page_445"></a>Engels’ comment cuts to the heart of the attempt to give lip service to principles that are
      being gutted: “The preamble thus imposes upon socialism the imperative duty to carry out something which it had
      declared to be impossible in the preceding paragraph.”<sup class="calibre13" id="ch14--611"><a class="calibre14" id="ch14fn110"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch14fn110-r" id="ch14--613">110</a></sup> The contradiction was indubitable, but it could
      not remain a mere matter of muddle-headedness. Either the peasants’ cancer cure was being advocated as cynical
      social demagogy (hence Engels’ repeated statements in this article that this sort of thing should be left to the
      political anti-Semitic movement which specialized in it),<sup class="calibre13" id="ch14--614"><a class="calibre14" id="ch14fn111"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch14fn111-r" id="ch14--616">111</a></sup> or else the theory would eventually be dropped
      as “outlived dogma” as soon as it had performed its function of soothing the party into accepting the opportunist
      practice.

<div class="indent" id="ch14--617">
      While socialists have no interest in <em class="calibre8" id="ch14--618">hastening</em> the demise of the small peasant, argues
      Engels, they also cannot accept “the mission … to convert the present sham property of the small peasant in his
      fields into real property, that is to say, to convert the small tenant into an owner and the indebted owner into
      a debtless owner.” This is not the way to gain “real freedom” for the peasant; it protects “only the particular
      form of his servitude; it prolongs a situation in which he can neither live nor die.” Such planks may gain
      peasants’ support with the desired speed but “only if we make them a promise which we ourselves know we shall not
      be able to keep,” and “only to lose him again on the morrow if we cannot keep our promise.” As bad as this would
      be in relation to the small peasant, “it would border on treason were we to promise the same to the big and
      middle peasants.”<sup class="calibre13" id="ch14--619"><a class="calibre14" id="ch14fn112"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch14fn112-r" id="ch14--621">112</a></sup>

      At best the immediate demands offered on behalf of the small peasants in the Marseilles and Nantes agrarian

      prosperous existence in the status quo. It was important for the socialists to put forward palliatives, for

      prey of reactionary social demagogues.

<h2 id="ch14lev11"><a class="calibre15" id="page_446"></a>11. PROGRAMMATIC ISSUES: SOME BOUNDARIES</h2>
<div class="indent" id="ch14--626">
      The next group of issues concerns the context in which even the good demands were to be understood.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch14--627">
      4. <em class="calibre8" id="ch14--628">Of the immediate reforms proposed, which ones are special peasant demands, and which are
      general socialist demands that also help the peasant, among others?</em>
</div>
<div class="indent" id="ch14--629">
      The question serves to qualify the claim that the reformists (insofar as they do not abandon socialist
      principles) have unearthed some hitherto undiscovered practical ways to help the peasant. The application of
      certain <em class="calibre8" id="ch14--630">general</em> socialist demands to the plight of the peasant was already one of the
      positive features of the “Demands of the Communist Party of Germany” in 1848.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch14--631">
      Tax reform is a typical example. The Nantes program proposed the substitution of a progressive income tax for
      direct and indirect taxes. Engels commented that almost every party’s program had included this plank for years;
      but he argued that it could provide no solution to the peasants’ problem.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch14--632"><a class="calibre14" id="ch14fn113"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch14fn113-r" id="ch14--634">113</a></sup> Likewise with demands
      for free health services, and other proposals good in themselves.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch14--635"><a class="calibre14" id="ch14fn114"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch14fn114-r" id="ch14--637">114</a></sup>

      5. <em class="calibre8" id="ch14--639">Which of the</em> “<em class="calibre8" id="ch14--640">immediate” demands are really achievable under
      capitalism and which are not?</em>
</div>
<div class="indent" id="ch14--641">
      This question, too, undercuts the claim that the reformist approach provides practical solutions for the peasant
      right now. The income tax plank applies here as well. Engels argues that if it is a question of raising the
      entire state budget by the income tax and abolishing all other taxes, “no government except a socialist one can
      undertake any such thing.” The same argument is directed against the plank proposing tough laws against excessive
      interest (usury), “a police measure that has always failed everywhere for the last two thousand years.”<sup class="calibre13" id="ch14--642"><a class="calibre14" id="ch14fn115"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch14fn115-r" id="ch14--644">115</a></sup> For
      as long as the peasant has no alternative to the usurer, the law will be somehow circumvented, and insofar as it
      is not, then private capital ceases to be interested in giving peasants credit when they need it.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch14--645">
      Unattainability under capitalism is, of course, not itself a reason for refraining from raising a demand. (It is
      possible that Engels’ emphasis in this article might tend to give his readers a contrary impression.) Both Engels
      and Marx had often enough raised proposals that were “transitional” demands, the fight for them showing that
      capitalism could not <a class="calibre6" id="page_447"></a>satisfy the people’s needs but that socialism could. The difference
      from the reformists’ approach was not in the legitimacy of the demand but in the political context of the
      struggle for them; and this was precisely what was beclouded by the Nantes preamble.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch14--647">

      Small-scale palliatives could have small-scale advantages that were by no means contemptible; concrete situations
      required investigation. In a quite different context, Engels once had occasion to write a Russian economist about
      such palliative measures for peasants:
    </div>
<div class="bq" id="ch14--654">
      The petty palliative measures which, in Germany (as you have become convinced) and also elsewhere, have done
      precious little good might perhaps help the people get over the political crisis here and there in Russia and
      keep their [cottage domestic] industry going for a while until they themselves get to have a say in
      things.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch14--655"><a class="calibre14" id="ch14fn117"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch14fn117-r" id="ch14--657">117</a></sup>

      This, of course, is a classic device: a measure is passed with fanfare on the plea of helping the poor while
      actually it chiefly benefits the ruling class. There is certainly no reason for socialists to lend their own name
      and cover to such a swindle, as they scratch around for peasant-catching planks. Engels points the finger at two
      points in the Nantes platform. One, which advocates lowering certain transportation charges for farm produce, “is
      on the whole in effect in Germany, and mainly in the interests—of the big landowners.” Another, advocating
      government aid to soil improvement and technical progress in agriculture, “is also above all in the interest of
      the big landed estates.”<sup class="calibre13" id="ch14--663"><a class="calibre14" id="ch14fn118"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch14fn118-r" id="ch14--665">118</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="indent" id="ch14--666">
      Naturally, the socialists should favor technological progress, but particular measures had to be examined to see
      how they were financed and for whose benefit; in any case it was a deception to treat such planks as an answer to
      the small peasants’ plight.

</div>
<div class="indent" id="ch14--671">
      An important case is alluded to only in passing in Engels’ 1894 article; he had taken it up bluntly in a letter
      to Lafargue the previous March. The socialist deputy Jean Jaurès—casting about as usual for a means of saving the
      peasant from an admittedly inevitable doom—came up with a proposal to give the state a monopoly of grain
      importing, to keep prices up and prevent speculation. Other socialist deputies, including Guesde, supported this.
      Engels was appalled.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch14--672">
      In the first place, Engels showed, the scheme in part had the effect of a protective tariff, “purely to the
      advantage of the big landowners into the bargain, since the small ones <em class="calibre8" id="ch14--673">have no grain to
      sell</em>, their produce not even sufficing for their own consumption.” The Zurich social-reformists had been
      advocating this measure for years.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch14--674"><a class="calibre14" id="ch14fn119"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch14fn119-r" id="ch14--676">119</a></sup> Even more revealing: a similar proposal for a state monopoly of grain
      importation was made in the Reichstag by the Prussian Junker, Count Kanitz: “This motion, made in the interest of
      the landed aristocracy of Eastern Germany, <em class="calibre8" id="ch14--677">is almost literally the proposition Jaurès</em>
      which was to show the way to the Socialist world how to use their parliamentary position in the interest of the
      working class and the peasantry.”<sup class="calibre13" id="ch14--678"><a class="calibre14" id="ch14fn120"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch14fn120-r" id="ch14--680">120</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="indent" id="ch14--681">
      In the second place, the proposal was a gross example of “<em class="calibre8" id="ch14--682">State-socialism</em> which
      represents one of the <em class="calibre8" id="ch14--683">infantile diseases</em> of proletarian socialism,” for application by a
      state dominated by the very speculators to be controlled.<a class="calibre6" id="ch14en16-r"></a><a class="nounder1" href="43.html#ch14en16" id="ch14--685">*</a> This means that the same elements who enriched themselves from the Panama swindle
      would be given another means of fleecing the people: “you want to present them with several thousand millions and
      the national credit, so that they can clean out other people’s pockets more thoroughly by means of <em class="calibre8" id="ch14--686">State-socialism!</em>”<sup class="calibre13" id="ch14--687"><a class="calibre14" id="ch14fn121"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch14fn121-r" id="ch14--689">121</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="indent" id="ch14--690">
      As for the tariff-like effect of the proposal: even the peasant advocate Jaurès agreed theoretically that
      socialists should not support the protective-tariff solution: while this might give some immediate benefit to the
      peasant (in the course of enriching the big landowners) the small gain would be at the expense of a substantial
      blow at the conditions of the urban workers. Jaurès—whom an admirer has praised as a “peasant <a class="calibre6" id="page_449"></a>of genius calibre”<sup class="calibre13" id="ch14--692"><a class="calibre14" id="ch14fn122"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch14fn122-r" id="ch14--694">122</a></sup>—characteristically shilly-shallied on the tariff issue as on other basic
      class questions. Thus the opportunist peasant-catching campaign progressed, from protecting big-peasant
      exploiters of labor at the expense of the farm workers to pumping vitality into the peasant economy at the
      expense of the urban workers.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch14--695">
      The history of socialism records a constant pattern: deviations from principle are first justified by
      opportunists on practical immediate grounds (along with scorn of dogmatists who cling to principle “rigidly”),
      and in a second phase the deviation itself is turned into the principle. This was the case in the later
      working-out of the peasant question by German reformism. In France, Jaurès was pressed by bourgeois attacks on
      his alleged hypocrisy (really his two-headedness on the peasant question) to explain how he could be for
      socialization in industry but not on the land; and so he wound up with the lapidary formula that “Socialism has
      no systematic preference for one or another way of organizing labor.”<sup class="calibre13" id="ch14--696"><a class="calibre14" id="ch14fn123"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch14fn123-r" id="ch14--698">123</a></sup> That is, socialism has
      no preference for a socialist way of organizing industry …
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch14--699">
      Thus the French socialists launched their peasant program with a contradiction: “the imperative duty to carry out
      something which it had declared to be impossible.” But, in real politics, such a contradiction never remains
      within the sphere of logic and is not settled by debaters. It had to be acted out in political life, where it was
      gradually revealed that at stake was the difference between a class party of proletarian revolution and a
      parliamentary “people’s party” of bourgeois reform.

<div class="indent" id="ch14--701">
      All this leaves a number of programmatic planks for immediate reforms on behalf of the small peasant and rural
      laborer, for integration into a socialist program with the proper theoretical context.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch14--702">
      Among them are eight planks from the Marseilles program which Engels summarizes without criticism or objection.
      The point he makes about them is, again, directed to the opportunists’ claim of a new practicality:
    </div>
<div class="bq" id="ch14--703">
      As we see, the demands made in the interests of the peasants … are not very far-reaching. Part of them has
      already been <a class="calibre6" id="page_450"></a>realized elsewhere…. The other points, too, could be carried into effect
      without any substantial impairment of the existing capitalist order. So much simply in characterization of the
      program. No reproach is intended; quite the contrary.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch14--705"><a class="calibre14" id="ch14fn124"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch14fn124-r" id="ch14--707">124</a></sup>

      Other specific demands come up in the course of the article.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch14--709">
      Of great interest also is this passage of general import, following Engels’ rejection of the use of force in
      changing peasant property relations:
    </div>
<div class="bq" id="ch14--710">
      Moreover, we can advocate that the struggle of the capitalists and big landlords against the small peasants
      should be waged from now on with a minimum of unfair means and that direct robbery and cheating, which are
      practised only too often, be as far as possible prevented. In this we shall succeed only in exceptional cases.
      Under the developed capitalist mode of production nobody can tell where honesty ends and cheating begins. But
      always it will make a considerable difference whether public authority is on the side of the cheater or the
      cheated. We of course are decidedly on the side of the small peasant; we shall do everything at all permissible
      to make his lot more bearable, to facilitate his transition to the cooperative should he decide to do so, and
      even to make it possible for him to remain on his small holding for a protracted length of time to think the
      matter over, should he still be unable to bring himself to this decision. We do this not only because we consider
      the small peasant living by his own labor as virtually belonging to us, but also in the direct interest of the
      party.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch14--711"><a class="calibre14" id="ch14fn125"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch14fn125-r" id="ch14--713">125</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="indent" id="ch14--714">
      Within the boundaries thus marked out by Engels, the elaboration of a program of demands for peasants need not be
      a difficulty for the party. It was different with a stickier question: the local “peasantizing” of party
      membership.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch14--715">
      This problem concerned not individual memberships but rather the ingestion and integration of recognizable social
      strata. It depended on the basis on which party membership was expanded. A peasant—even more, a rural worker—who
      really did become a socialist and revolutionary and who accordingly joined the party was a valuable acquisition.
      But peasants who were encouraged to join a rural party branch <em class="calibre8" id="ch14--716">with their peasant mentalities
      essentially unchanged</em>, in expectation of immediate boons—these tended to be alien elements.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch14--717">
      It was the latter pattern that was showing up especially in South <a class="calibre6" id="page_451"></a>Germany: as we saw, Engels
      noted that preference was being given by the regional party leadership to the bigger and more influential
      peasants (who could furnish voters) and not to the farm workers. Engels challenged this conception of building
      the party:
    </div>
<div class="bqi" id="ch14--719">
      I flatly deny that the socialist workers’ party of any country is charged with the task of taking into its fold,
      in addition to the rural proletarians and the small peasants, also the middle and big peasants and perhaps even
      the tenants of big estates, the capitalist cattle breeders, and the other capitalist exploiters of the national
      soil. To all of them the feudality of landownership may appear to be a common foe. On certain questions we may
      make common cause with them and be able to fight side by side with them for definite aims. We can use in our
      party individuals from every class of society, but have no use whatever for any groups representing capitalist,
      middle-bourgeois or middle-peasant interests.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch14--720"><a class="calibre14" id="ch14fn126"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch14fn126-r" id="ch14--722">126</a></sup>

<div class="noindent" id="ch14--723">
      “We have no more use for the peasant as a party member if he expects us to perpetuate his property in his small
      holding than for the small handicraftsman who would fain be perpetuated as a master. These people belong to the
      anti-Semites,” wrote Engels rather bitterly.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch14--724"><a class="calibre14" id="ch14fn127"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch14fn127-r" id="ch14--726">127</a></sup> For in his opinion the South German section of the party was
      already becoming a political Frankenstein’s monster, as a result of Vollmar’s social grafting of transplanted
      classes on the body of the proletarian party. In the month that saw the publication of Engels’ article, the press
      had carried an open exchange of polemics between Vollmar and Bebel. Engels wrote to a correspondent:
    </div>
<div class="bqi" id="ch14--727">
      The row in the party did not get me stirred up very much; it is much better if something comes up from time to
      time and gets chewed over regularly than if people go to sleep. It is exactly the ever-increasing and
      irresistible expansion of the party that entails the fact that the new elements are harder to digest than the
      earlier recruits. We already have the workers of the big cities, therefore the most intelligent and alert people;
      those who come along now are either workers in small towns or rural districts, or students, salesmen, etc., or
      petty-bourgeois who are struggling against ruin, and rural domestic-industry people who still have a patch of
      land of their own or on rental; and now, into the bargain, regular small peasants too. And since in fact our
      party is the only really progressive party, and besides the only one that is strong enough to force through
      progressive things, there is ever-present <a class="calibre6" id="page_452"></a>temptation to do a little socialist work also on
      the debt-ridden middle and big peasants who are becoming rebellious, especially in the rural areas where these
      people are predominant. That way, next, things go beyond the bounds of what is permissible in principle in our
      party; next, there are rows, but our party has so healthy a constitution that all of that hurts nothing.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch14--729"><a class="calibre14" id="ch14fn128"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch14fn128-r" id="ch14--731">128</a></sup>

      Engels died a few months after writing this valiant attempt to stress the positive side of the conflict in the
      party. But, as we know in hindsight, the Social-Democratic Party was suffering from a fatal disease. That belongs
      to another story, but it should be borne in mind in connection with the chapters to follow.
