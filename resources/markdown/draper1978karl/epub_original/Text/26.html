    ELEMENTS</strong></h1>
<div class="indent" id="ch17--3">
      Now let us focus not on intellectual laborers in general but more narrowly on the particular intellectual stratum
      that became prominent with the rise of the bourgeoisie, as identified in the previous chapter.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch17--4"><a class="calibre14" id="ch17fn1"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch17fn1-r" id="ch17--6">1</a></sup> If, as Marx
      thought, the ruling ideas of an epoch tend to be the ideas of the ruling class, here we have the human agents of
      this process. They provide a service to “society,” that is, to the class whose interests are usually identified
      with the interests of society; and this service primarily consists in providing and manipulating ideas. Such a
      service, to be eligible for reward, must be necessary or congenial to the continued well-being of the dominant
      powers in society.
    </div>
<h2 id="ch17lev1">1. THE “SERVANTS OF POWER”</h2>
<div class="indentb" id="ch17--8">
      The foregoing simply restates Marx’s basic view of class society and historical change (“historical
      materialism”). But principles of social dynamics are implemented not by theories but by human beings, hence by
      social strata. The sway of bourgeois ideology is exerted in the last analysis through people, not through
      ethereal forces. And this is the social sense in which the intellectuals who perform this service are properly
      regarded as <em class="calibre8" id="ch17--9">bourgeois intellectuals</em>, regardless of personal origin: “the <em class="calibre8" id="ch17--10">ideological</em> representatives and spokesmen of the [given] classes, their learned men, lawyers,
      physicians, etc., in short: their so-called <em class="calibre8" id="ch17--11">capacites</em> [men of talent].”<sup class="calibre13" id="ch17--12"><a class="calibre14" id="ch17fn2"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch17fn2-r" id="ch17--14">2</a></sup> One must not
      imagine, warned Marx (in a context discussing the French petty-bourgeoisie but in words applying broadly), that
      the political or ideological representatives of <a class="calibre6" id="page_503"></a>this class “are indeed all shopkeepers or
      enthusiastic champions of shopkeepers.”
    </div>
<div class="bq" id="ch17--16">
      According to their education and their individual position they may be as far apart as heaven from earth. What
      makes them representatives of the petty-bourgeoisie is the fact that in their minds they do not get beyond the
      limits which the latter do not get beyond in life, that they are consequently driven, theoretically, to the same
      problems and solutions to which material interest and social position drive the latter practically. This is, in
      general, the relationship between the <em class="calibre8" id="ch17--17">political</em> and <em class="calibre8" id="ch17--18">literary
      representatives</em> of a class and the class they represent.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch17--19"><a class="calibre14" id="ch17fn3"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch17fn3-r" id="ch17--21">3</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="noindenttb" id="ch17--22">
      And it is in this spirit that Marx refers, in the same work, to “<em class="calibre8" id="ch17--23">capital</em>, with its retinue
      of lawyers, professors and smooth-tongued orators.”<sup class="calibre13" id="ch17--24"><a class="calibre14" id="ch17fn4"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch17fn4-r" id="ch17--26">4</a></sup> As early as <em class="calibre8" id="ch17--27">The German Ideology</em>, Marx had
      pointed to the intellectual strata whose social function it was to foster suitable fantasies. Kant’s philosophy,
      he wrote, reflected the need, in the German society of the time, to convert French bourgeois liberalism into
      purely ideological concepts and moral postulates, at a time when both bourgeoisie and aristocracy were swathed in
      illusions about Germany’s role in the Napoleonic era.
    </div>
<div class="bq" id="ch17--28">
      Given these universal illusions, it was quite in order that the professions [<em class="calibre8" id="ch17--29">Stánde</em>]
      privileged in illusions, the ideologists, the schoolmasters, the students, the Tugendbund [patriotic society]
      members, should talk big and give a suitable highflown expression to the universal fantasy-spinning and
      indifference.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch17--30"><a class="calibre14" id="ch17fn5"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch17fn5-r" id="ch17--32">5</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="noindentt" id="ch17--33">
      They were the illusion-makers.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch17--34">
      Thus Marx directs attention to the social role of these ideological servicemen, not their individual motivation
      or psychology; it is best to assume that all upstanding intellectuals are motivated by the search for Truth and
      Light just as all bureaucrats desire Justice. However, those seekers for Truth and Light whose search leads them
      counter to the interests of the dominant class are less likely to be heard from; and so the objective result for
      society is scarcely determined by good intentions. If a particular intellectual activity is more or less socially
      neutral by nature—say, chess-playing—its practitioners will be expected at least not to use their activities and
      prestige to contravene the dominant social interests. In any case, for Marx the interests of the ruling class
      establish the decisive conditioning influences, boundaries of behavior, <a class="calibre6" id="page_504"></a>place in the social
      structure, and lines of activity leading to rewards.
    </div>
<div class="indentb" id="ch17--36">
      In the most general sense, this describes the role of intellectual elements in relation to the larger social
      forces. Marx mentioned the generality in the course of an 1847 article:
    </div>
<div class="bq" id="ch17--37">
      The abolition of feudal property relations and the establishment of modern bourgeois society was therefore not at
      all the result of a certain doctrine which stemmed from a particular theoretical principle as its <em class="calibre8" id="ch17--38">kernel</em> and deduced further conclusions from it. Rather, the principles and theories that the
      writers of the bourgeoisie put forward during its struggle with feudalism were nothing but the theoretical
      expression of the practical movement…<sup class="calibre13" id="ch17--39"><a class="calibre14" id="ch17fn6"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch17fn6-r" id="ch17--41">6</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="noindentt" id="ch17--42">
      In spite of the intensive “nothing but” in the last sentence, Marx also recognized that there was a “reciprocal
      influence” of material and intellectual production, not a simple one-way effect, and in the 1890s Engels had
      occasion to emphasize the semi-autonomous role of ideological factors (including ideological laborers) within the
      boundaries of a system.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch17--43"><a class="calibre14" id="ch17fn7"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch17fn7-r" id="ch17--45">7</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="indentb" id="ch17--46">
      During the 1848 revolution, the Frankfurt parliament was crammed with professorial and literary representatives
      of the bourgeoisie who lived out the problem of how the intellectual represents the class. After discussing one
      example, the ex-radical Ruge, Engels commented:
    </div>
<div class="bq" id="ch17--47">
      He, like all of the more or less ideological Left, sees his most cherished pet enthusiasms, his greatest efforts
      of thought, wrecked by the class whose representative he is. His philanthropic-cosmopolitan scheme is wrecked by
      mean huckster minds, and he himself, without knowing it or wanting to, must represent these huckster minds in a
      more or less ideologically distorted fashion. The ideologue proposes, the huckster disposes. Tragic irony of
      world history!<sup class="calibre13" id="ch17--48"><a class="calibre14" id="ch17fn7a"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch17fn7a-r" id="ch17--50">7a</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="indentt" id="ch17--51">
      However, Marx devoted no general theoretical work to this question any more than to dozens of others, and in
      practice we find that his ad hoc references to this sort of ideological labor were more often provoked by the
      offenses of particularly objectionable apologists of the status quo than by broad historical considerations. The
      provocations were plentiful.
    </div>
<div class="indentb" id="ch17--52">
      Thus he wrote about the Franco-Prussian War: “It has given our professors the best opportunity of discrediting
      themselves in the eyes of the whole world for being servile pedants.”<sup class="calibre13" id="ch17--53"><a class="calibre14" id="ch17fn8"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch17fn8-r" id="ch17--55">8</a></sup> Then, in his Second <a class="calibre6" id="page_505"></a>Address on the war, he noted that when the Prussian king abandoned his promise of defensive war
      only, the “stage managers” arranged for the appearance of public pressure on him. “They at once gave the cue to
      the liberal German middle class [bourgeoisie], with its professors, its capitalists, its aldermen, and its
      penmen.”<sup class="calibre13" id="ch17--57"><a class="calibre14" id="ch17fn9"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch17fn9-r" id="ch17--59">9</a></sup> In his notebook on the economist Adolph Wagner, he waxed sarcastic about the
      academic mind: German society, he wrote, has emerged out of feudal into capitalist economy, “but the professors
      still stand with one foot in the old crap, as is natural. From being serfs of the landowners they have changed
      over to being serfs of the state, <em class="calibre8" id="ch17--60">vulgo</em> [in popular parlance] the government.”<sup class="calibre13" id="ch17--61"><a class="calibre14" id="ch17fn10"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch17fn10-r" id="ch17--63">10</a></sup> In the
      1850s Marx saw Bonaparte’s regime losing the support not only of the bourgeoisie but of virtually every stratum
      of civil society—and therefore, at long last, of the intellectuals:
    </div>
<div class="bq" id="ch17--64">
      °°Liberty, not only in its bodily forms, but in its very soul, its intellectual life, has shriveled at the coarse
      touch of these resurrectionists of a bygone epoch [the Bonapartists]. Consequently, the representatives of
      intellectual France, by no means distinguished by too nice a delicacy of political conscience, never failing to
      gather around every regime, from the Regent to Robespierre—from Louis XIV to Louis Philippe—from the first Empire
      to the second Republic—have, for the first time in French history, seceded in mass from an established
      government.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch17--65"><a class="calibre14" id="ch17fn11"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch17fn11-r" id="ch17--67">11</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="noindentt" id="ch17--68">
      Among the more violent imprecations is Engels’ treatment, in an unpublished 1847 manuscript, of the whole tribe
      of penpushers, the <em class="calibre8" id="ch17--69">Herren Literaten</em>, as “this lowest of all venal classes.”<sup class="calibre13" id="ch17--70"><a class="calibre14" id="ch17fn12"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch17fn12-r" id="ch17--72">12</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="indent" id="ch17--73">
      To be sure, it was probably Marx’s opinion that the mass of the intellectual hacks who made their living as
      camp-followers of the established social powers constituted the large majority of the trade; therefore this type
      is of more significance in establishing the character of an intelligentsia as a social stratum than is, for
      example, a discussion of Goethe’s relationship to the society of his time. Two remarks are necessary for
      perspective. Firstly: there is obviously an element of emotional and even intestinal revulsion in Marx’s and
      Engels’ reaction to the role of the intellectual laborers who provide a system’s rulers with their ideological
      cover; and while the reasons for and justification of this revulsion need no explanation, it must be separated
      from a comprehension of the socioeconomic place of intellectual laborers of this sort. Secondly: the present
      subject merges into another one which is not in our purview, namely, how the needs and pressures of the status
      <a class="calibre6" id="page_506"></a>quo and its establishment are reflected not in the services performed by the hacks but in
      the intellectual products of the most highminded of philosophers, writers, artists, and ideologists—a subject on
      which there is a considerable literature. For some purposes it is enlightening to examine the relation to social
      issues of Balzac, Byron, Beethoven, or Bacon; but geniuses do not constitute a social stratum.
    </div>
<div class="indentb" id="ch17--75">
      Is the offense of ideological laborers the fact that they act as intellectual sycophants of a bad system and
      society? Would their souls be saved if they did the same job for a good system, say, socialism; that is,
      transferred their apologetic role from the overthrown capitalists to the ascendant proletariat? Not in Marx’s
      view: the great significance of social emancipation is that it also emancipates the thinker from a fate as a
      class instrument into a “free agent of thought.” In the following passage Marx is discussing the stake of
      middle-class elements (of various sorts) in the victory of the Paris Commune, that is, in the coming of a
      socialist society. Although written in rough English, it uses <em class="calibre8" id="ch17--76">science</em> with the wider
      meaning of <em class="calibre8" id="ch17--77">Wissenschaft</em>—knowledge and learning as well as science in the usual sense.
    </div>
<div class="bq" id="ch17--78">
      °°They feel that only the working class can emancipate them from priest rule, convert science from an instrument
      of class rule into a popular force, convert the men of science themselves from the panderers to class prejudice,
      place hunting state parasites, and allies of capital into free agents of thought! Science can only play its
      genuine part in the Republic of Labour.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch17--79"><a class="calibre14" id="ch17fn13"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch17fn13-r" id="ch17--81">13</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="noindentt" id="ch17--82">
      Clearly, intellectuals are not “free agents of thought” today. Tomorrow they can hope to be independent vis-á-vis
      the new state and social powers.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch17--83">
      None of this implies that intellectual operatives necessarily play their roles consciously. Systematic hypocrisy
      of a conscious sort is exceptional; and it is undesirable, since sincerity and a projection of personal
      righteousness is a great aid to persuasiveness. No hypocrite can be a first-rate apologist; lack of conviction
      makes advocates ineffective even if it does not make them alcoholics. It is therefore an occupational necessity
      for intellectuals to reject Marx’s view of their social role and class dependency. One of the ideas they cannot
      entertain is the idea that they are “The Servants of Power.”<a class="calibre6" id="ch17en1-r"></a><a class="nounder1" href="43.html#ch17en1" id="ch17--85">*</a>
</div>
<div class="indent" id="ch17--86">
<a class="calibre6" id="page_507"></a>If the indentured “men of ideas” must cling to the feeling of independence from class power,
      they must also ascribe the same independence to the realm of ideas itself. The notion that social ideas are not
      autonomous creations of the intellect but intimately related to class domination—this notion is seen to be as
      abhorrent as the attendant idea that they themselves are servitors of a power outside their skulls. Marx’s method
      of interpreting social change and its ideologies, a class analysis of history, comes to look like a personal
      insult. To prove it wrong they need only look into their own souls, with its consciousness of integrity.
      Ironically, therefore, it is the “men of ideas” who need no ideas to refute Marxism; they can do it by intuition
      and introspection. Thus, their maintenance of a false consciousness does not depend altogether on ideological and
      other pressures as it usually does in the case of the working class; it is built into their life-condition. The
      intellectuals become carriers of the ideological malady because they are also its deepest-diseased victims.
    </div>
<h2 id="ch17lev2">2. THE EXCEPTIONAL CASES</h2>
<div class="indent" id="ch17--89">
      No social stratum acts in unison like a regiment on parade; and few social strata are naturally as variegated as
      the intellectual category we are examining. As in every other case without exception, the social tendency we have
      described has exceptions.
    </div>
<div class="indentb" id="ch17--90">
      Recognition of this fact was a platitude before Marx, and already in <em class="calibre8" id="ch17--91">The German Ideology</em>
      he mentioned it as a matter of course. Bourgeois development produces a class, the proletariat, from which arises
      the communist consciousness, “which can, of course, also arise among the other classes by dint of looking at the
      situation of this class.”<sup class="calibre13" id="ch17--92"><a class="calibre14" id="ch17fn14"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch17fn14-r" id="ch17--94">14</a></sup> But only with particular individuals, not as a class phenomenon. He first made
      this point polemically in a refutation of Heinzen’s nonclass radicalism, which counterposed “humanity” to class
      society:
    </div>
<div class="bqi" id="ch17--95">
      It is very “possible” that particular individuals are not “always” determined by the class to which they belong—a
      fact that is as little decisive for the class struggle as was the defection of a few nobles to the Third Estates
      for the French Revolution. And at that time these nobles at least went over to <em class="calibre8" id="ch17--96">one</em> class,
      the revolutionary class, the bourgeoisie. But Mr. Heinzen lets all classes melt away before the ceremonial idea
      of “humanity.”<sup class="calibre13" id="ch17--97"><a class="calibre14" id="ch17fn15"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch17fn15-r" id="ch17--99">15</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="noindentt" id="ch17--100">
<a class="calibre6" id="page_508"></a>It is true (Marx goes on to say) that particular individuals are not determined, but it is
      not true “that <em class="calibre8" id="ch17--102">whole classes</em> which are based on <em class="calibre8" id="ch17--103">economic</em>
      conditions independent of their will and are set by these conditions in the most antagonistic opposition to each
      other, can break out of their real relationships by virtue of the quality of ‘humanity’ inherent in all
      men.”<sup class="calibre13" id="ch17--104"><a class="calibre14" id="ch17fn16"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch17fn16-r" id="ch17--106">16</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="indentb" id="ch17--107">
      Clearly there is even more room for special cases in a group which, while conditioned by economic pressures, does
      not itself form an independent class, and does not have the degree of homogeneity characteristic of a class.
      “Looking at the situation of this class [the proletariat]” with close familiarity and some empathy can lead
      particular individuals to a degree of independence from bourgeois apologetics even apart from full-fledged
      communism. Marx’s admiration for the corps of British factory inspectors is well known, and he wrote it down very
      strongly:
    </div>
<div class="bq" id="ch17--108">
      … I willingly embrace the opportunity of paying my respects to those British factory-inspectors, who, in the
      teeth of all powerful class-interests, have taken up the protection of the down-trodden multitude with a moral
      courage, a steadfast energy, and an intellectual superiority of which there are not to be found many parallels in
      these times of mammon-worship.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch17--109"><a class="calibre14" id="ch17fn17"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch17fn17-r" id="ch17--111">17</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="noindentt" id="ch17--112">
      Yet, without detracting an iota from one’s proper admiration for their moral courage, we know that the attitude
      adopted by these intellectually superior men was in the long run beneficial and necessary for the continued
      health of capitalism, and that the “powerful class interests” that hated them were typical of the myopic
      profit-grubbers whose unchecked excesses would have buried capitalism long ago. Without following this thought
      further, we only note that a distinction must be observed between admirable bourgeois friends of labor, who do
      not make a basic break with their own class, and social revolutionaries of bourgeois origin, who do.<a class="calibre6" id="ch17en2-r"></a><a class="nounder1" href="43.html#ch17en2" id="ch17--114">*</a>

<a class="calibre6" id="page_509"></a>The <em class="calibre8" id="ch17--117">Communist Manifesto</em> is concerned with the latter type, and
      specifically with the recruitment of trained personnel. There are three paragraphs on the question: <em class="calibre8" id="ch17--118">How does the proletarian movement acquire educated elements?</em> It sees three ways in which such
      elements are gained from the bourgeoisie.
    </div>
<div class="indentb" id="ch17--119">
      Firstly, in its struggle against the aristocracy, the bourgeoisie seeks help from the proletariat and thus drags
      it into the political arena:
    </div>
<div class="bq" id="ch17--120">
      The bourgeoisie itself, therefore, supplies the proletariat with its own elements of education, i.e., with
      weapons against itself.
    </div>
<div class="noindent" id="ch17--121">
      Secondly:
    </div>
<div class="bqi" id="ch17--122">
      Further, as we have already seen, entire sections of the ruling classes are, by the advance of industry,
      precipitated into the proletariat, or are at least threatened in their conditions of existence. These also supply
      the proletariat with a mass of elements of education.<a class="calibre6" id="ch17en3-r"></a><a class="nounder1" href="43.html#ch17en3" id="ch17--124">*</a>
</div>
<div class="noindenttb" id="ch17--125">

      Finally, in times when the class struggle nears the decisive hour, the process of dissolution going on within the
      ruling class, in fact within the whole range of old society, assumes such a violent, glaring character, that a
      small section of the ruling class cuts itself adrift, and joins the revolutionary class, the class that holds the
      future in its hands. Just as, therefore, at an earlier period, a section of the nobility went over to the
      bourgeoisie, so now a portion of the bourgeoisie goes over to the proletariat, and in particular, a portion of
      the bourgeois ideologists, who have raised themselves to the level of comprehending theoretically the historical
      movement as a whole.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch17--130"><a class="calibre14" id="ch17fn21"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch17fn21-r" id="ch17--132">21</a></sup>

      Let us remark on two things.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch17--134">
<a class="calibre6" id="page_510"></a>1. Marx’s concern is not how the proletarian movement gains “intellectuals,” though this is
      how it seems to read to many intellectuals who write books on Marx. The subject is much broader: how the movement
      may be reinforced by <em class="calibre8" id="ch17--136">educated</em> individuals breaking with the bourgeoisie. The “bourgeois
      ideologists” among these are given special attention only at the end of the third passage.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch17--137">
      2. The coming over of “a small section” of the bourgeoisie is seen as occurring only shortly before the
      revolutionary victory. Before that, special individuals might be expected, examples being well known at the time.
      The prominent cases were more than exceptional: they were rare and extraordinary men and even rarer women,
      including not only geniuses (Saint-Simon, for example) but others who were at least prodigies. To equate a Robert
      Owen or a Fourier with the case of some litterateur or academic who finally joined the socialist party in the
      1890s is simply pointless. And no section or portion of the bourgeoisie, however small, came over with Owen or
      any other one of these exceptional individuals, even if the noun <em class="calibre8" id="ch17--138">intellectual</em> is defined
      in some way to cover the practical businessman Owen, the traveling salesman Fourier, and the rest.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch17--139">
      In short, the Manifesto’s treatment of these special individuals does not have in view the later problem of
      socialist recruitment from a stratum of bourgeois intellectuals. However, it offered some guidance in the
      treatment of similar problems. These problems multiplied in the German party in the ensuing decades as
      reform-minded intellectuals found no progressive bourgeois party with enough courage, integrity, and consistency
      to attract them, and found only the Social-Democratic Party at hand as a surrogate—especially after the removal
      of the Anti-Socialist Law in 1890.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch17--140">
      The problem then became the very opposite of that discussed in the Manifesto: what to do about “bourgeois
      ideologists” who come over to the proletarian party not as a result of cutting themselves loose from their own
      class but in order to cut the proletarian party loose from its “antiquated” class-struggle foundations, that is,
      in order to convert it into the bourgeois reform party they lacked. This is how Marx and Engels saw the main
      problem to the end.
    </div>
<h2 id="ch17lev3"><a class="calibre15" id="page_511"></a>3. SOME GUIDELINES</h2>
<div class="indent" id="ch17--143">
      But of course there is no rule of thumb for distinguishing the exceptional individuals of one type from the
      bourgeois intellectuals of the other; nothing for it but the individual try out. A full treatment of this problem
      would at this point require a short history of the German movement and its relation to Marx and Engels, but in
      this and the next chapter we summarize the highlights of their conclusions and developing attitudes. Here are
      some general conclusions to begin with.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch17--144">
      1. From the start Marx’s dominant attitude toward bourgeois elements, whether intellectuals of some sort or not,
      who approach the proletarian movement may be summed up as mistrust tempered by hope, or apprehension sweetened by
      expectation. The hope was, however, considerably greater than Jesus’ view of rich men and the needle’s eye, after
      which “they that heard it said, Who then can be saved?” Marx was by no means so pessimistic about the chances of
      an intellectual’s squeezing through to aid the revolutionary party with his educated talents.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch17--145">
      Engels made an important distinction in a letter to the party’s newspaper editor, then E. Bernstein, mentioning
      that he had liked some articles of his: “also your treatment of the ‘intellectuals’ as people who fall into our
      lap of themselves insofar as they are worth anything, but who, insofar as they had to be wooed, can only become
      harmful to us …”<sup class="calibre13" id="ch17--146"><a class="calibre14" id="ch17fn22"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch17fn22-r" id="ch17--148">22</a></sup> No doubt one reason for Engels’ lively approval of Bernstein’s articles was the
      standoffishness—almost studied condescension—with which he treated this source of recruitment; he most certainly
      did not woo them.<a class="calibre6" id="ch17en4-r"></a><a class="nounder1" href="43.html#ch17en4" id="ch17--150">*</a>
</div>
<div class="indentb" id="ch17--151">
<a class="calibre6" id="page_512"></a>2. In any case the number of real exceptions to the rule was expected to remain small—at
      least until “the class struggle nears the decisive hour” (in the words of the Manifesto). Up to 1848’s decisive
      hour, the exceptional cases had become prominent among the leaders and publicists. For decades after the defeat
      and the ensuing reaction, the “men of ideas” found that they had other ideas after all. Engels remarked in a
      letter to Marx:
    </div>
<div class="bq" id="ch17--153">
      The supply of <em class="calibre8" id="ch17--154">heads</em> that since ’48 were brought over to the proletariat from other
      classes seems to have totally dried up since then, and in all countries. It seems the workers must do it <em class="calibre8" id="ch17--155">themselves</em> more and more.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch17--156"><a class="calibre14" id="ch17fn24"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch17fn24-r" id="ch17--158">24</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="indentt" id="ch17--159">
      This was a plain statement of fact. Even later, not long before there was indeed an influx of intellectuals into
      the German party in the aftermath of an electoral victory, Engels wrote wryly that Kautsky “claims he has found
      one very good Ph.D. If he <em class="calibre8" id="ch17--160">really</em> is good, he would be very welcome.”<sup class="calibre13" id="ch17--161"><a class="calibre14" id="ch17fn25"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch17fn25-r" id="ch17--163">25</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="indentb" id="ch17--164">
      3. Among the least welcome recruits were the <em class="calibre8" id="ch17--165">failed intellectuals:</em> those who, unable to
      meet the competition, sought greener fields in which to exercise meager talents. At hand are a couple of examples
      that happen to relate to students. In a letter of 1883 Engels noted that
    </div>
<div class="bq" id="ch17--166">
      the philistine elements, which were drawn into the party shortly before the Anti-Socialist Law [1878] and prevail
      particularly among college graduates and undergraduates who did not get as far as the examinations, are still
      there and will bear close watching …<sup class="calibre13" id="ch17--167"><a class="calibre14" id="ch17fn26"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch17fn26-r" id="ch17--169">26</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="noindentt" id="ch17--170">
      The same thrust occurs in an 1891 letter referring to “the students who were being driven into the
      Social-Democracy out of fear of the examinations.”<sup class="calibre13" id="ch17--171"><a class="calibre14" id="ch17fn27"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch17fn27-r" id="ch17--173">27</a></sup> Students show up here because the type is objectively
      verifiable in their case, but they are by no means the main problem. However, this type should not be confused
      with a very different one: <a class="calibre6" id="page_513"></a>the <em class="calibre8" id="ch17--175">frustrated intellectuals</em> who cannot
      realize their intellectual aspirations under bourgeois conditions and turn to the alternative world for
      noncareerist reasons.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch17--176">
      4. Another positive element is constituted by the underpaid-overexploited intellectual laborers, who are kept at
      a near-proletarian level of subsistence because their type of contribution is low-valued by bourgeois society. In
      this connection we get the term “intellectual proletarian” or “literary proletarian” and the like—quite common in
      socialist literature and sometimes used by Marx or Engels too. This literature often failed to distinguish
      between two different meanings of the term. In Marx’s terms, the only scientifically precise use of <em class="calibre8" id="ch17--177">intellectual proletarian</em> would refer to the intellectual laborers (analyzed in the preceding
      chapter) who actually produce surplus-value for a capitalist entrepreneur—by, say, the fabrication of “Compendia
      of Economics” for a publisher “in factory style,” to take an example already given.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch17--178"><a class="calibre14" id="ch17fn28"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch17fn28-r" id="ch17--180">28</a></sup> But no less legitimate
      was a metaphorical usage, in which certain underpaid intellectual laborers were called “proletarian” to emphasize
      that they remained poor and propertyless regardless of talent, that is, shared these aspects of the proletarian
      life-condition. In this way Marx referred to rural schoolteachers as “the proletarians of the learned
      class.”<sup class="calibre13" id="ch17--181"><a class="calibre14" id="ch17fn29"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch17fn29-r" id="ch17--183">29</a></sup> This kind of reference to the “intellectual proletariat” became even more
      plentiful in the period of the Second International, especially where the scientific distinction was not
      important for publicist purposes.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch17--184">
      In either case Marx’s receptivity to these more or less intellectual elements, who merged with the proletarian
      movement as fellow-exploited, would obviously be far greater than to bourgeois intellectuals who came from other
      directions.
    </div>
<div class="indentb" id="ch17--185">
      5. One of the most objectionable types was the fellow-traveler who wished to keep a foot in both camps, without
      cutting ties with the bourgeois establishment. Engels saw the very model of this variety in a Dr. Max Quarck (who
      later did join the party):
    </div>
<div class="bq" id="ch17--186">
      °°This Quarck is one of half a dozen young literati who hover about the boundary land between our Party and the
      Katheder-Sozialismus [academic state-socialism], take jolly good care to keep clear of all the risks involved in
      being connected with our Party, and yet expect to reap all the benefits that may accrue from such connection.
      They make a lively propaganda for <em class="calibre8" id="ch17--187">das soziale Kaisertum der Hohenzollern</em> [the social
      monarchy of the <a class="calibre6" id="page_514"></a>Hohenzollerns] (which Quarck has dithyrambically celebrated), for Rodbertus
      against Marx … and especially for each other.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch17--189"><a class="calibre14" id="ch17fn30"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch17fn30-r" id="ch17--191">30</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="indentt" id="ch17--192">
      For such elements their privileged status as Thinkers in the workers’ movement could be parlayed into a form of
      prestige back in the intellectual establishment. Engels warned against the characterless types who are driven by
      “the need to come forward, not in the eyes of the workers but of the philistines, as a Very Important worthy, who
      doesn’t long remain the terrible man-eater for which he passes.”<sup class="calibre13" id="ch17--193"><a class="calibre14" id="ch17fn31"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch17fn31-r" id="ch17--195">31</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="indent" id="ch17--196">
      6. An intellectual’s motivation for coming over to the proletarian movement was, then, always important for the
      prognosis; but <em class="calibre8" id="ch17--197">why</em> often translated into <em class="calibre8" id="ch17--198">when.</em> When the party had
      an electoral success, career opportunities opened for ideologues; when the trade-union movement became
      respectable, the penpusher and the <em class="calibre8" id="ch17--199">porte-parole</em> could enjoy safe jobs; when the party
      became legal, progressive politicians could give free rein to their good intentions without being inconvenienced
      by the police, and moreover be sure of a good press when they denounced narrow class-struggle dogmas which would
      harm the party by depriving it of such splendid recruits as themselves. We shall see examples of the conjunctures
      at which this occurred.
    </div>
<h2 id="ch17lev4">4. TENDENCIES AMONG RADICAL INTELLECTUALS</h2>
<div class="indent" id="ch17--201">
      The German party began making its first impressive gains after Marx’s death, and so the problem of radical
      intellectuals in its most acute forms fell mostly to Engels. However, the first big episode pointing to the
      coming problem came in 1879 (the “manifesto of the three Zurichers,” or Hochberg tendency), and we shall see
      Marx’s violent reaction in several connections.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch17--202">
      A good introduction to the overall patterns is provided by an open letter Engels published in 1890. It was evoked
      by a faction of young intellectuals in the German party self-styled the <em class="calibre8" id="ch17--203">Jungen</em> (Youth),
      whose positive side was that it attacked the beginnings of opportunist degeneration among the Social-Democratic
      parliamentarians; but the standpoint it counterposed was elitist and sectarian. (The group’s leaders mostly wound
      up eventually as authoritarian rightists)<sup class="calibre13" id="ch17--204"><a class="calibre14" id="ch17fn32"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch17fn32-r" id="ch17--206">32</a></sup> Engels stayed <a class="calibre6" id="page_515"></a>out of the melee until the
      group’s paper made public use of his name as if he were a supporter, in a ploy common to literary clique wars. He
      was then forced to state his opinion equally publicly. We are interested here in his analysis of the group as a
      coterie of radical intellectuals.
    </div>
<div class="indentb" id="ch17--208">
      Engels’ open letter mapped a good deal of the terrain:
    </div>
<div class="bqi" id="ch17--209">
      As for theory, I find in it [the group’s paper] … a strenuously distorted “Marxism”: characterized, in the first
      place, by a big misunderstanding of the viewpoint they claim to represent; in the second place, by gross
      ignorance of the always decisive historical facts; in the third place, by the consciousness of their own
      immeasurable superiority which is so profitably evident to German littérateurs….
    </div>
<div class="bqi" id="ch17--210">
      As for practice, I found in it a reckless disregard of all the actual circumstances of the party struggle, a
      death-defying “overcoming of obstacles” in fantasy, which indeed does all honor to the unflagging youthful ardor
      of the authors but which, in the course of being translated from idea into reality, would be capable of burying
      even the strongest party of millions under the well-deserved laughter of the whole enemy world. And that even a
      little sect cannot allow itself such acrobatic politics without paying a penalty—on this the gentlemen have since
      had their own experiences….
    </div>
<div class="noindenttb" id="ch17--211">
      Above all, in summary:
    </div>
<div class="bq" id="ch17--212">
      Let them understand that their “academic education”—which in any case needs a basic, critical self-review—gives
      them no officer’s commission with a claim to a corresponding post in the party; that in our party everyone must
      serve in the ranks; that posts of responsibility in the party will be won not simply by literary talent and
      theoretical knowledge, even if both of these are present beyond a doubt, but that in addition what is required is
      thorough familiarity with the conditions of the party struggle and seasoning in its forms, tested personnel
      reliability and sound character, and, finally, willing enlistment in the ranks of the fighters;—in short, that
      they, the “academically educated people,” have far more to learn from the workers, all in all, than the latter
      have to learn from them.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch17--213"><a class="calibre14" id="ch17fn33"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch17fn33-r" id="ch17--215">33</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="indentt" id="ch17--216">
      This touches on or suggests some of the major tendencies arising out of the entrance of these “academically
      educated people” into a movement dominated by a working-class membership and built by working-class <a class="calibre6" id="page_516"></a>activists. Let us enlarge on five such tendencies, beginning with one not directly exemplified by
      the <em class="calibre8" id="ch17--218">Jungen.</em>
</div>
<div class="indent" id="ch17--219">
      1. <em class="calibre8" id="ch17--220">Reformism and bourgeoisification.</em>
</div>
<div class="indent" id="ch17--221">
      While the <em class="calibre8" id="ch17--222">Jungen</em> had begun with an appearance of leftism, the main tendency of
      intellectual recruits to the German party was to the right, that is, toward accommodation with the bourgeois
      world from which they were not breaking.
    </div>
<div class="indentb" id="ch17--223">
      In 1879, in response to the imposition of the Anti-Socialist Law by Bismarck the previous year, a trio of leading
      party “literati” (to use Marx’s favorite designation) came out with a programmatic article making the first open
      proposal to turn the party into a bourgeoisified social-reform party of parliamentarism. The matter was quite
      serious since it was likely that the trio’s leader, Karl Hochberg, rich scion of a banking family, was going to
      be entrusted with launching the party’s organ in emigration, since he could provide the money to do it. In this
      article, wrote Engels to a friend, they
    </div>
<div class="bq" id="ch17--224">
      come out as wholly ordinary bourgeois, peaceful philanthropists; they accuse the party of having been too
      exclusively a “<em class="calibre8" id="ch17--225">workers’ party</em>,” of having provoked the hatred of the bourgeoisie, and
      they lay claim to the leadership of the movement for “educated” bourgeois of their own stamp.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch17--226"><a class="calibre14" id="ch17fn34"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch17fn34-r" id="ch17--228">34</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="noindenttb" id="ch17--229">
      In mid-September Marx and Engels sent a Circular Letter on this crisis to the party leadership; it is one of the
      three or four most important political statements ever drawn up by them, and we shall have several occasions to
      come back to it. To a friend Marx wrote that the party needed editorial talent of a quite different sort, an
      editor who would keep at arm’s length “the pack of Ph. D.’s and students, etc. and the professorial-socialism
      [<em class="calibre8" id="ch17--230">Katbedersozialismus</em>] crew that strut about in the <em class="calibre8" id="ch17--231">Zukunft</em>

      These fellows—ciphers in theory, good-for-nothing in practice—want to draw the teeth of socialism (which they
      have hashed together after some university recipes) and especially of the Social-Democratic <em class="calibre8" id="ch17--233">party</em>, to enlighten the workers, or, as they put it, to provide them with “elements of
      education” through their own confused half-knowledge, and above all to make the party respectable in the eyes of
      the philistines. They are wretched <em class="calibre8" id="ch17--234">counterrevolutionary</em> windbags.

<div class="noindentt" id="ch17--235">
<a class="calibre6" id="page_517"></a>Hőchberg had come to London to enlighten Engels, and “was stunned when Engels gave it to him
      straight: he is a ‘peaceful’ evolutionary and expects proletarian emancipation actually only from ‘educated
      bourgeois,’ i.e., people like himself.”<sup class="calibre13" id="ch17--237"><a class="calibre14" id="ch17fn35"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch17fn35-r" id="ch17--239">35</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="indent" id="ch17--240">
      Three years later Engels, writing to the same friend, referred back to this unsuccessful attempt by the “Messrs.
      Literati” of the party “to carry out a turn toward a reactionary, bourgeois, tame and educated tendency.” The
      Höchberg program had “demanded that the party’s behavior, be more eddicated<sup class="calibre13" id="ch17--241"><a class="calibre14" id="ch17en5-r"></a><a class="nounder2" href="43.html#ch17en5" id="ch17--243">*</a></sup> and respectable, more
      presentable in the drawingroom.” They “would like to beg off the Anti-Socialist Law at any price through mildness
      and softness, cringing and tameness, because it makes short work of their literary livelihood.” He expected that
      when the Anti-Socialist Law was abolished, they “will form a separate right wing, in which case we can then treat
      with them from case to case, until they finally and definitively fall on their asses.”<sup class="calibre13" id="ch17--244"><a class="calibre14" id="ch17fn36"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch17fn36-r" id="ch17--246">36</a></sup>

      But the problem became worse as the party showed electoral strength, and thus became “possible” for left-wing
      intellectuals who retained prudent regard for their standing in the bourgeois world. By 1884 Engels was
      expressing the following view, as he opined that the possible demise of a party magazine was no misfortune:
    </div>
<div class="bq" id="ch17--248">

      be to them from the pecuniary standpoint; they can express themselves without let or hindrance—we are hindered
      from giving them a whack. Hence, merely filling up such a magazine every month requires an enormous amount of
      patient forbearance, and gradually gets it overrunning with philanthropism, humanitarianism, sentimentalism, and
      whatever all the antirevolutionary vices of the Freiwalds, Quarcks, Schippels, Rosuses, etc. are called.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch17--254"><a class="calibre14" id="ch17fn37"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch17fn37-r" id="ch17--256">37</a></sup>

      A year later came one of the many attempts by the party parliamentarians to steer the movement toward the
      peaceful haven of reform <a class="calibre6" id="page_518"></a>politics. Engels as usual linked this to the top layer of
      bourgeois-educated elements that was encrusting the party, while the party remained overwhelmingly proletarian in
      its ranks:
    </div>
<div class="bqi" id="ch17--259">
      The row in the German party did not surprise me. In a land of petty-bourgeois philistines [<em class="calibre8" id="ch17--260">Spiessbürger</em>] like Germany the party is also bound to have a philistine “educated” right wing,
      which it shakes off at the decisive moment. Philistine-socialism dates from 1844 in Germany and was already
      criticized in the <em class="calibre8" id="ch17--261">Communist Manifesto.</em> It is as immortal as the German philistine

      The substitution of abstractions for realities, the disembodying of ideas, is one of the characteristic
      afflictions of intellectuals that Marx was specially sensitive to. It was nowhere more rife than among German
      intellectuals, for historical reasons that Marx explained more than once. Even in the course of the
      rough-and-tumble of the 1848 revolutionary upsurge, he took occasion to comment on this aspect of the
      bourgeois-liberal savants who pullulated in the Frankfurt National Assembly—the “assembly of professors,” as he
      called it.

      One of the characteristic forms of intellectual abstractionism which cropped up in the movement was the
      subordination of social struggle to some purely ideological <em class="calibre8" id="ch17--274">ism</em> which is given
      primacy—for example, atheism as a social movement. There were such types among the few intellectuals attracted to
      the First International, including Peter Fox, with whom Marx collaborated well. But Fox’s weak side was that his
      previous contacts with workers had been only as a propagandist for atheism. Marx commented: “But it is so easy to
      get rationalism [anti-supernaturalism] across among the English workers that one must <a class="calibre6" id="page_519"></a>watch
      out very much as soon as literati, bourgeois or semi-literati take part in the movement.”<sup class="calibre13" id="ch17--276"><a class="calibre14" id="ch17fn40"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch17fn40-r" id="ch17--278">40</a></sup> The

<div class="indent" id="ch17--280">
      Similarly, for Marx “sentimentalism” is a question of the <em class="calibre8" id="ch17--281">substitution</em> of a sentimental
      emphasis for a class-struggle approach to social and political issues. Nor did he have any greater use for the
      daydreaming type of propaganda exercise in the press: “You will have noticed [Marx wrote a friend] that
      semi-erudite philistine fantasies show up in the <em class="calibre8" id="ch17--282">Volksstaat</em> from time to time. This stuff

      Following the 1875 fusion with the Lassalleans, Marx began to sense a certain effluvium in the winds that blew
      from some of the new “educated elements” in the united party:
    </div>
<div class="bq" id="ch17--287">
      A rotten spirit is making itself felt in our party in Germany, not so much among the masses as among the leaders
      (upper-class and “workers”). The compromise with the Lassalleans has led to a compromise with other halfway
      elements too: in Berlin (via [<em class="calibre8" id="ch17--288">Johann</em>] <em class="calibre8" id="ch17--289">Most</em>) with Dühring and his
      “admirers,” but also with a whole gang of half-mature students and superwise Ph.D.’s who want to give socialism a
      “higher, idealistic” orientation, that is, to replace its materialist basis (which demands serious objective
      study from anyone who tries to use it) by modern mythology with its goddesses of Justice, Liberty, Equality and
      <em class="calibre8" id="ch17--290">Fraternité</em>. Dr. Hochberg, who publishes the <em class="calibre8" id="ch17--291">Zukunft</em>, is a
      representative of this tendency and has “bought his way” into the party—with the “noblest” intentions, I assume,

      3. <em class="calibre8" id="ch17--298">Instability and ultraism.</em>
</div>
<div class="indentb" id="ch17--299">
      Because the bourgeois intellectual is more detached from social realities, or tries to be, and may in some cases
      be less inhibited by money considerations, he or she can be more volatile, erratic, and unstable than most
      workers—at least in terms of ideas, if not action. This pattern may reach a peak with students, who after all are
      apprentice intellectuals, and who are still relatively untrammeled by responsibility. <a class="calibre6" id="page_520"></a>In the
      socialist movement, an outsize proportion of intellectuals have been generally found both in the right wing and
      in the more exotic ultraradical sects—in the latter often as a stopover to the former, as the case of the <em class="calibre8" id="ch17--301">Jungen</em> illustrated. Oscillatory motion is a characteristic feature. Marx even commented along
      these lines on the fact that his own writings sold so well in Russia—to the educated classes, of course, not the
      masses.
    </div>
<div class="bq" id="ch17--302">
      But too much should not be made of all this. The Russian aristocracy is, in its youth, educated at German
      universities and in Paris. They always run after the most extreme that the West can offer.
    </div>
<div class="bqi" id="ch17--303">
      It is pure gourmandise, such as a part of the French aristocracy practised during the eighteenth century. <em class="calibre8" id="ch17--304">Ce n’est pas pour les tailleurs et les bottiers</em> [It’s not for the tailors and shoemakers], said
      Voltaire in those days of his own Enlightenment. This does not prevent the same Russians, once they enter state
      service, from becoming rascals.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch17--305"><a class="calibre14" id="ch17fn43"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch17fn43-r" id="ch17--307">43</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="indenttb" id="ch17--308">
      These same types were to be found among the intellectuals attracted by Bakuninist rhetoric about abstention from
      politics, “social liquidation,” and other grandiose phrases.
    </div>
<div class="bqi" id="ch17--309">
      All this sounds extremely radical and is so simple that it can be learnt by heart in five minutes; that is why
      the Bakuninist theory has speedily found favor also in Italy and Spain among young lawyers, doctors [Ph.D.s] and
      other doctrinaires.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch17--310"><a class="calibre14" id="ch17fn44"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch17fn44-r" id="ch17--312">44</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="noindenttb" id="ch17--313">
      These types lack seriousness; dilettantism goes along with the pattern. One of Engels’ last letters noted the
      problem of
    </div>
<div class="bq" id="ch17--314">
      a country like Italy, where the socialist party, like all the other parties, suffers from the invasion, as of
      locusts, by that “declassed bourgeois youth” of which Bakunin was so proud. Result: pullulation of literary
      dilettantism, only too often turning into sensationalism, and necessarily followed by a coterie spirit which
      dominates the press.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch17--315"><a class="calibre14" id="ch17fn45"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch17fn45-r" id="ch17--317">45</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="indentt" id="ch17--318">
      It is not the merely personal characteristics of individuals that form this pattern; on the contrary, these
      characteristics crop up widely and regularly because they flow from a social molding force. These types are in a
      hurry, they are impatient—not necessarily out of vulgar career ism but because there are so many other
      life-alternatives pulling at them. They are scornful of a course that demands a long investment in <a class="calibre6" id="page_521"></a>plugging away and waiting—unlike workers who plug away and wait most of their lives. It was to H.
      M. Hyndman, the most thorough bourgeois who ever led a self-styled Marxist group, that Engels applied the biting
      Gallic saying: “<em class="calibre8" id="ch17--320">Cet homme n'ira pas loin</em>, <em class="calibre8" id="ch17--321">il ne sait pas

      pattern, in politics as elsewhere, betrays the bourgeois mentality.

      4. <em class="calibre8" id="ch17--326">Elitism and authoritarianism.</em>
</div>
<div class="indent" id="ch17--327">
      Perhaps the most prominent tendency among intellectuals—built in by their onesidedness—is to assume the natural
      superiority of the educated talents and their prerogative to become shepherds leading the flock of the
      unenlightened.
    </div>
<div class="indentb" id="ch17--328">
      This does not necessarily mean that the elitist intellectuals themselves aspire to the role of authoritarian
      leader, which role is usually outside their taste or competence. It does mean their tendency to support, justify
      or accept the necessity of some sort of control from above over the inferior masses, especially if the Leader is
      enlightened enough to recognize the intellectual’s claim to special status as first lieutenant. Hence this
      tendency operates just as forcibly in a parliamentary setup as in a dictatorial one, and the context of this
      discussion is in no way peculiar to totalitarianisms. However, extreme authoritarianisms exhibit all tendencies
      in an extreme way, hence most visibly. In 1852 Marx, writing for the <em class="calibre8" id="ch17--329">New York Tribune</em>,
      attacked the self-styled Democrats who connived with Bonaparte’s regime, some of them even looking up to that
      protofascist despot as the hope of revolution.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch17--330"><a class="calibre14" id="ch17fn47"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch17fn47-r" id="ch17--332">47</a></sup> To the inevitable objections Marx replied roundly:

<div class="bq" id="ch17--333">
      °°To the gentlemen of the Democratic press, and especially of the German Democratic press, who, as usual, have
      yelled the loudest, I say they are all bigoted Crypto-Royalists. These gentlemen can not do without kings, gods
      and popes. Scarcely got out of the leading strings of their old rulers, they manufacture new ones for themselves,
      and grow indignant at those infidels and rebels who render themselves obnoxious by publishing unpleasant truths,
      revealing compromising facts and thus committing <em class="calibre8" id="ch17--334">lèse</em>-majesty and sacrilege against the
      newly-elevated Democratic gods and kings.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch17--335"><a class="calibre14" id="ch17fn48"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch17fn48-r" id="ch17--337">48</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="indenttb" id="ch17--338">
      Marx’s target was the tendency of the bourgeois literati to grab the coattails of Power and to look for salvation
      to a savior-ruler (a suitably enlightened one), but in any case not to the ignorant masses, who might <a class="calibre6" id="page_522"></a>be so barbaric as even to rebel against their intellectual superiors. This was a pervasive issue
      in Marx’s and Engels’ explosive denunciation of the Hochberg tendency in 1879. In their aforementioned Circular
      Letter, they drew a bead on the following passage in what they called the “manifesto of the Three Zurichers”:
    </div>
<div class="bq" id="ch17--340">
      “The movement [wrote the trio], which Lassalle regarded as an eminently political one, to which he summoned not
      only the workers but all honest democrats, <em class="calibre8" id="ch17--341">at the head of which</em> were to march the
      independent representatives of science and <em class="calibre8" id="ch17--342">all men imbued with true love of humanity</em>, was
      lowered … to a <em class="calibre8" id="ch17--343">onesided struggle of the industrial workers in their own interests.</em>” [The
      emphasis is by Marx as he quotes this.]<sup class="calibre13" id="ch17--344"><a class="calibre14" id="ch17fn49"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch17fn49-r" id="ch17--346">49</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="noindenttb" id="ch17--347">
      This openly stated an appeal to eradicate the class-struggle character of the movement and replace proletarian
      socialism with an allegedly non-class socialism officered by bourgeois intellectuals of the educated classes.
      Marx and Engels underlined this:
    </div>
<div class="bqi" id="ch17--348">
      In the opinion of these gentlemen, then, the Social-Democratic Party should <em class="calibre8" id="ch17--349">not</em> be a
      onesided workers’ party but an all-sided party of “all men imbued with true love of humanity.” It must prove this
      above all by laying aside coarse proletarian passions and placing itself under the guidance of educated,
      philanthropic bourgeois “in order to cultivate good taste” and “learn good form” … Then, too, “<em class="calibre8" id="ch17--350">numerous adherents</em> from the circles of the <em class="calibre8" id="ch17--351">educated</em> and <em class="calibre8" id="ch17--352">propertied</em> classes will make their appearance …”
    </div>
<div class="noindentt" id="ch17--353">
      The Hochberg article indicated further that such elements “among the so-called upper strata of society” are
      needed especially because “the Party still lacks men fit to represent it in the Reichstag.” Only in rare cases
      can “the simple worker” be entrusted with the deputy’s mandate. In this way the Hochberg group specifically
      linked party leadership by educated bourgeois to the development of reformist parliamentarism. In short,
      concluded Marx and Engels in the Circular Letter, the trio’s viewpoint amounts to this: “the working class of
      itself is incapable of its own emancipation. For this purpose it must place itself under the leadership of
      ‘educated and propertied’ bourgeois who alone possess the ‘time and opportunity’ to acquaint themselves with what
      is good for the workers …”<sup class="calibre13" id="ch17--354"><a class="calibre14" id="ch17fn50"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch17fn50-r" id="ch17--356">50</a></sup>

      The de facto domination of the party’s Reichstag group by educated <a class="calibre6" id="page_523"></a>bourgeois opportunists

      manifestation of the “rotten spirit” that permeated the party leadership and created the need for a split. All
      during the decade before his death, Engels inveighed against “the schoolmarmish supercilious snobbery of our

      editorial positions on the new journals which pullulate, and, as usual, they regard the bourgeois university as a

      But these were observations from outside. Engels’ concern kept coming back to the German party, whose internal
      evolution he could follow more closely. It was not only a question of the bourgeois recruits: there were the
      party leaders who fawned on the “eddicated” and truckled to them. On top the worst case was Wilhelm Liebknecht,
      who “not only has himself welcomed every halfway social-democratic ‘eddicated’ man with open arms and without
      looking him over closely, but besides, his son-in-law, the fat dullard Bruno Geiser, is one of the biggest

      the tendency to <em class="calibre8" id="ch17--415">counterpose</em> socialism as a Good Idea to the class movement as a defective
      reality.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch17--416">
      Since the crux of Marx’s politics is the central place he gives to the militant movement of the class as such,
      regardless of its temporary program,<sup class="calibre13" id="ch17--417"><a class="calibre14" id="ch17fn62"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch17fn62-r" id="ch17--419">62</a></sup> there is no kind of socialism more antithetical than Marx’s to the typical
      intellectual mentality. We will see why Marx and Engels fulminated against a series of socialist sects, some of
      them set up by more or less Marxistical intellectuals; but it will suffice to stress now that the general reason
      was always the sect’s conception of the relation between the intellectual idea (bodied forth in the sect) and the
      class-in-movement.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch17--420">
      This, along with preceding point 4, indicates the source of the close association in socialist history between
      intellectuals and sectism: firstly, predilection for the primacy of ideas over material interests; and secondly,
      elitist fear of a mass movement which is not under the control of Superior Minds. This intellectualist fear of
      self-moving masses is transmuted into programmatic terms by the ultimatistic requirement that a class movement
      must measure up to intellectually established political standards before it can be accepted without
      contamination.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch17--421">
      This is also why the test case has often been the attitude of revolutionaries or would-be revolutionaries to the
      reality of a reformist <a class="calibre6" id="page_526"></a>trade-union movement which reflects the working class as it is at a
      particular stage. As explained in <a class="nounder1" href="11.html#ch04" id="ch17--423">Chapter 4</a> above, only
      Marx’s theory established an integral link between social revolution and reformist trade unions as class
      organizations; only his theory saw trade unions as a revolutionary fact even if and when they are
      antirevolutionary in politics; only it saw the social struggle as one in which the basic division was not along
      idea lines but along class lines.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch17--424">
      To put it still another way: sectists saw socialism primarily as a <em class="calibre8" id="ch17--425">concept to convince people
      of;</em> that is, they looked at socialism in the same way that intellectuals habitually look at the world. Marx
      saw socialism as the necessary outcome of the proletariat’s struggle; his theory argued that it was this class
      whose own struggle, even under nonsocialist leadership and on a relatively low level, shakes the foundations of
      capitalist society. Marx and Engels reiterated that “Every step of real movement is more important than a dozen
      programs.”<sup class="calibre13" id="ch17--426"><a class="calibre14" id="ch17fn63"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch17fn63-r" id="ch17--428">63</a></sup> Radical intellectuals often hear this as expressing contempt for ideas and
      glorification of pragmatic shortsightedness; that is, they have no idea what it means.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch17--429">
      This is not to say that the only source of sectism in the history of socialism is the influence of intellectuals.
      While the phenomenon is by no means limited to intellectuals, the following can be stated: <em class="calibre8" id="ch17--430">the
      sect is a form of organization characteristically congenial to the intellectual as a radical elitist.</em> (In
      nonradical and mass-party contexts, the analogous form is often the clique or academic coterie.) The sect
      provides an organizational package to express the predilection of intellectuals for elitist modes of
      influence—for their strength lies in their heads rather than in numbers, money or brawn; to express their
      insistence on the primacy of the idea over material interests—for they have only the former to offer; to express
      their propensity to seek insulation against the masses, the Dark Masses who impinge on their consciousness mainly
      as a dangerously uncontrollable beast-organism.

<h2 id="ch17lev5">5. INTELLECTUAL ELITISM: THE CASE OF LASSALLE</h2>
<div class="indent" id="ch17--432">
      Conflicts with intellectual-elitist tendencies peppered Marx’s career.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch17--433">
      We have already discussed Marx’s earliest attack on a tendency embodying a fullblown intellectual elitism: his
      polemic against the <a class="calibre6" id="page_527"></a>Bauer group in <em class="calibre8" id="ch17--435">The Holy Family.</em><sup class="calibre13" id="ch17--436"><a class="calibre14" id="ch17fn64"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch17fn64-r" id="ch17--438">64</a></sup> By this
      time, the latter part of 1844, young Engels too was becoming conscious of the patronizing arrogance of the
      intellectual circles with which he and Marx were beginning to break. In a letter to Marx (only his second) he
      satirically predicted that the Bauer group was due to discover a new messiah who would erect a New Jerusalem,
      complete with well-planned privies, after which it would “declare that it is all in all, that it unites capital,
      talent and labor in its own head, that everything produced is produced by <em class="calibre8" id="ch17--439">it</em> and not by
      the impotent masses—and commandeer everything for itself.”<sup class="calibre13" id="ch17--440"><a class="calibre14" id="ch17fn65"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch17fn65-r" id="ch17--442">65</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="indent" id="ch17--443">
      But, as Marx’s friend Heine was singing around this same time: “<em class="calibre8" id="ch17--444">Other times, and other
      birds!</em> / <em class="calibre8" id="ch17--445">Other birds, and other songs!”</em><sup class="calibre13" id="ch17--446"><a class="calibre14" id="ch17fn66"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch17fn66-r" id="ch17--448">66</a></sup> When the German
      social-democratic movement was founded in the 1860s under the leadership of Ferdinand Lassalle, this clever man
      was not singing the rather simple-minded songs of the Bauerite elitists, who were so naive as to denounce the
      Stupid Masses openly.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch17--449">
      Lassalle is one of the outstanding exceptions to the rule that intellectuals themselves do not aspire to be
      Maximum Leader. Here we are concerned not with the main line of Lassalle’s politics (state-socialism),<sup class="calibre13" id="ch17--450"><a class="calibre14" id="ch17fn67"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch17fn67-r" id="ch17--452">67</a></sup> nor
      primarily with his aspiration to become literally the dictator of the workers’ movement, but rather with his
      self-image as a Captain of Intellect in politics<a class="calibre6" id="ch17en7-r"></a><a class="nounder1" href="43.html#ch17en7" id="ch17--454">*</a> and with Marx’s reaction to this aspect of Lassalle.
    </div>
<div class="indentb" id="ch17--455">
      Marx first became aware of Lassalle’s “longing for dictatorship” in 1856, without quite believing the initial
      reports that came to him.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch17--456"><a class="calibre14" id="ch17fn68"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch17fn68-r" id="ch17--458">68</a></sup> But by 1862-1863 the pattern was plain.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch17--459"><a class="calibre14" id="ch17fn69"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch17fn69-r" id="ch17--461">69</a></sup> In 1863 Lassalle sent
      Marx a pamphlet of his in which he made his bid for leadership of the German workers’ movement. Marx commented in
      a letter to Engels:
    </div>
<div class="bq" id="ch17--462">
      He behaves—with an air of great importance bandying about phrases borrowed from us—altogether as if he were the
      future workers’ dictator. The problem of wage-labor versus capital he solves like “child’s play” (literally). To
      wit, the workers must agitate for <em class="calibre8" id="ch17--463">universal suffrage</em> and then send people like him “armed
      with the unsheathed sword of science [<em class="calibre8" id="ch17--464">Wissenschaft</em>]” into the Chamber of
      Deputies.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch17--465"><a class="calibre14" id="ch17fn70"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch17fn70-r" id="ch17--467">70</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="noindenttb" id="ch17--468">
      Here is how Lassalle had put it in the pamphlet, addressing himself to the workers:
    </div>
<div class="bq" id="ch17--469">
<a class="calibre6" id="page_528"></a>When that [universal suffrage] comes, you can depend upon it, there will be at your side men
      who understand your position and are devoted to your cause—men, armed with the shining sword of science, who know
      how to defend your interests. And then you, the unpropertied classes, will only have yourselves and your bad
      voting to blame if the representatives of your cause remain in a minority …<sup class="calibre13" id="ch17--471"><a class="calibre14" id="ch17fn71"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch17fn71-r" id="ch17--473">71</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="noindentt" id="ch17--474">
      This is a frank statement of the attitude later assumed by most of the Social-Democratic deputies blessed with a
      bourgeois education, who thought in terms of <em class="calibre8" id="ch17--475">we</em> and <em class="calibre8" id="ch17--476">they</em>—the
      latter being the ignorant workers who sometimes made trouble by presuming to dictate to their representatives.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch17--477">
      In one respect Lassalle did carry out the pattern of the elitist intellectual clambering up to the ear of power.
      The mantle of “workers’ dictator” was only his preliminary to a higher aim: steering the kaiser himself toward
      the Social Monarchy, that is, an allegedly anticapitalist welfare regime carried out by the royal power, based
      not on the bourgeoisie but on a working class organized as Lassalle’s instrument. Marx understood this completely
      by 1865, though the secret documents that spelled out Lassalle’s aims were not revealed till over half a century
      later. Marx summed it up in terms of the characters in Schiller’s drama <em class="calibre8" id="ch17--478">Don Carlos:</em>
      “Lassalle wanted to play the Marquis Posa of the proletariat with Philip II of the Uckermark, Bismarck acting as
      procurer between him and the Prussian kingdom.”<sup class="calibre13" id="ch17--479"><a class="calibre14" id="ch17fn72"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch17fn72-r" id="ch17--481">72</a></sup> The Marquis Posa figure was the standard model of the Good
      Royal Advisor whispering progressive aspirations into the monarch’s left ear.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch17--482"><a class="calibre14" id="ch17fn73"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch17fn73-r" id="ch17--484">73</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="indent" id="ch17--485">
      Also instructive is the discussion held by Marx and Engels with Lassalle on the latter’s poetic drama <em class="calibre8" id="ch17--486">Franz von Sickingen.</em> It was typical that the hero of the period chosen by Lassalle was not any
      leader of the Peasant War (such as Thomas Münzer) but the head of the knights’ opposition, Sickingen—an
      opposition which, while rebellious against the princes, lived by its own exploitation of the peasantry. Both Marx
      and Engels pointed this out in separate letters. Marx added that Sickingen and his co-leader Ulrich von Hutten
      “just like the <em class="calibre8" id="ch17--487">educated</em> Polish nobility of 1830, on the one hand, made themselves
      exponents of modern ideas, while on the other they actually represented the interests of a reactionary
      class.”<sup class="calibre13" id="ch17--488"><a class="calibre14" id="ch17fn74"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch17fn74-r" id="ch17--490">74</a></sup> Not for the first time Marx underlines that the interests of a reactionary
      class can be clothed in modernizing ideas as well as in reactionary ones.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch17--491">
<a class="calibre6" id="page_529"></a>Sickingen was not portrayed as an intellectual (any more than Rudolph of Gerolstein in Sue’s
      <em class="calibre8" id="ch17--493">Mysteries of Paris).</em> But, while in a letter to Marx Lassalle disparaged Ulrich von Hutten
      precisely because he <em class="calibre8" id="ch17--494">was</em> an intellectual type rather than a statesmanly man of action
      like Sickingen, we know now that in fact Lassalle identified himself personally with Hutten, not
      Sickingen.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch17--495"><a class="calibre14" id="ch17fn75"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch17fn75-r" id="ch17--497">75</a></sup> Thus we are pointed back again to the relationship of Sue to Rudolph: the
      intellectual glorifies the Leader on horseback, who in turn proves his worth by listening to the former’s wisdom;
      the philosopher-king is tutored by the king’s philosopher, who is the wisest servitor in the entourage of power;
      the schoolmaster wields his rod at the side of the Master.
    </div>
<h2 id="ch17lev6">6. “THE ALTITUDE OF ITS GREAT INTELLECTS”</h2>
<div class="indentb" id="ch17--499">
      Another element, not to be neglected, in Marx’s attitude on the relation of intellectuals to the workers’
      movement is sure to offend intellectuals. This was his generally low opinion of the intellectual caliber of the
      intellectuals, that is, of bourgeois thinkers who, whatever their politics, were unable to break out of the
      constricting and deforming frame imposed by the dominant ideas of their class society. This view was given acid
      epigrammatic form in <em class="calibre8" id="ch17--500">Capital:</em>
</div>
<div class="bq" id="ch17--501">
      On the level plain, simple mounds look like hills; and the imbecile flatness of the present bourgeoisie is to be
      measured by the altitude of its great intellects.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch17--502"><a class="calibre14" id="ch17fn76"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch17fn76-r" id="ch17--504">76</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="indentt" id="ch17--505">
      The target here was John Stuart Mill as an economist, but among the post-Ricardian economists Marx played few
      favorites—except perhaps for his special attention to Malthus as an intellectual charlatan. Marx thought Mill was
      dreadfully “shallow,” as he says in his Afterword to <em class="calibre8" id="ch17--506">Capital.</em> Here he explains why this
      situation obtains-, the discussion is in terms of economics but applies more generally. There is little point in
      explaining this view of Marx’s as a case of “jealousy” or cantankerousness, or utilizing some other all-purpose
      psychiatric device, which will fail to account for his treatment of Ricardo as a giant.
    </div>
<div class="indentb" id="ch17--507">
      Marx thinks that “the great capacity for theory, which used to be considered a hereditary German possession, had
      almost completely <a class="calibre6" id="page_530"></a>disappeared among the so-called educated classes in Germany” because the
      later crop of thinkers could not think their way through the <em class="calibre8" id="ch17--509">social</em> conditions that faced
      them; they were up against “the limits beyond which [they] could not pass.”<sup class="calibre13" id="ch17--510"><a class="calibre14" id="ch17fn77"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch17fn77-r" id="ch17--512">77</a></sup> That is, they could not
      arrive at real explanations that did not point outside the bounds of the system. Then, in addition, the rising
      prominence of the class struggle sounded the knell of scientific social inquiry:
    </div>
<div class="bq" id="ch17--513">
      It was thenceforth no longer a question whether this theorem or that was true, but whether it was useful to
      capital or harmful, expedient or inexpedient, politically dangerous or not. In place of disinterested inquirers,
      there were hired prizefighters; in place of genuine scientific research, the bad conscience and the evil intent
      of apologetic.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch17--514"><a class="calibre14" id="ch17fn78"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch17fn78-r" id="ch17--516">78</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="noindentt" id="ch17--517">

      to avoid becoming sycophants of the ruling class sought a harmonious middle ground for the interests of capital
      and labor—“Hence a shallow syncretism, of which John Stuart Mill is the best representative.”<sup class="calibre13" id="ch17--521"><a class="calibre14" id="ch17fn80"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch17fn80-r" id="ch17--523">80</a></sup>

      In France, Guizot had begun as a pioneer in the class interpretation of history, but he could not maintain this
      level, Marx points out. A scientific approach went by the board as he had to write a whitewash account of the
      Louis Philippe regime and his own role in it; and history was reduced to good and bad leaders. Marx concludes:
      “Indeed, not only <em class="calibre8" id="ch17--525">les rois s'en vont</em>, but also <em class="calibre8" id="ch17--526">les capacites de la
      bourgeoisie s'en vont</em>”—Not only do kings pass, but also the talented among the bourgeoisie.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch17--527"><a class="calibre14" id="ch17fn81"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch17fn81-r" id="ch17--529">81</a></sup>

      Not only the talented: Marx liked also to pillory the representative ranks of the bourgeoisie and the ruling
      circles for their ignorance of, unconcern with, and cynicism about the cultural heritage of society which the
      “better elements” were supposed to treasure. The division of labor “has, to a certain extent, emasculated the
      general intellect of the middle-class men by the circumspection of all their energies and mental faculties within
      the narrow spheres of their mercantile, industrial and professional concerns.”<sup class="calibre13" id="ch17--531"><a class="calibre14" id="ch17fn82"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch17fn82-r" id="ch17--533">82</a></sup> He wrote a cutting

<a class="calibre6" id="page_531"></a>Although the middle class do not aim at the learning of the old school, they do not for that

      All the more reason, then, to give close inspection to the educated bourgeois elements who knocked on the door of
      the workers’ party. For a considerable period of time, in Germany, this was no arduous task: the number of
      salutary intellectuals who entered the German party’s ranks—say, up to Marx’s death—was small, though a few
      exceptions were prominent. In the following years, Engels’ appreciation of the exceptions was often flavored with
      his mordant opinion of the others. In praise of Eduard Bernstein (then still writing as a staunch revolutionist)
      Engels remarked to Bebel: “In theoretical matters, Ede has a very receptive mind, clever and quick-witted, but he
      still lacks self-confidence—truly a rare thing nowadays and, compared with the general swelled head of even the
      pettiest educated jackass, it is really a good thing relatively speaking.” Bernstein and Kautsky are listed as
      “real pearls” in comparison with “the ghastly second-growth of literati that have latched on to the party,” and
      Engels’ approval of the second is expressed thus: “Kautsky learned a fearful mass of nonsense from the
      universities, but he has taken all possible pains to unlearn it again.” Outside these two pearls, <em class="calibre8" id="ch17--542">all</em> the other posts in the party press are held by “the Messrs. Philistines” who (Engels hopes)
      can be gotten rid of in the inevitable split that is coming. This in 1885.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch17--543"><a class="calibre14" id="ch17fn84"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch17fn84-r" id="ch17--545">84</a></sup> Engels’ opinion of
      Kautsky had gone up somewhat from four years before, when he had characterized him as “an extremely fine fellow
      but a born pedant and hairsplitter, in whose hands complicated questions do not become simple but rather simple
      questions become complicated.” He judged him unfit to edit a newspaper, where “such a doctrinaire is a real

      them exceptions.

<div class="indentb" id="ch17--550">
      Given their general opinion of the pickings, it is clear why Marx and Engels were made especially apprehensive by
      the tendency of the bourgeois-educated recruits to come into the movement as <em class="calibre8" id="ch17--551">teachers.</em>
      Teaching what? Their still bourgeois or half-bourgeois ideas, now taking on a pink tinge. Otherwise they would
      have to adopt the role of learners, apprentices, and novices—learning from the socialist workers how to think
      like revolutionists, like enemies of the class in whose matrix their own minds had been formed and their
      consciousness educated. In Marx’s and Engels’ eyes, these people came into the party ignorant—ignorant of

      That was an optimistic view; meanwhile it was precisely these bourgeois-educated ignoramuses who made a row over
      Engels’ exposure of the learned Dr. Dühring and even threatened to get its publication in the party press
      stopped.
    </div>
<div class="indentb" id="ch17--558">
      A similar point is also made in the Circular Letter of 1879 against the Hochberg trio: besides attacking this
      tendency as politically degenerative, it argued that these self-important “educated elements” were incompetent
      even to make an <em class="calibre8" id="ch17--559">educational</em> contribution to the movement:
    </div>
<div class="bq" id="ch17--560">
      … in order to be of use to the proletarian movement these people must bring real educative elements into it. But
      with the great majority of the German bourgeois converts that is not the case. Neither the <em class="calibre8" id="ch17--561">Zukunft</em> nor the <em class="calibre8" id="ch17--562">Neue Gesellschaft</em> has contributed anything which could
      advance the movement one step further. Here there is an absolute lack of real educational material, whether
      factual or theoretical. In its place there are attempts to bring superficially mastered socialist ideas into
      harmony with the exceedingly varied theoretical standpoints which these gentlemen have brought with them from the
      universities or elsewhere and of which, owing to the process of decomposition which the <a class="calibre6" id="page_533"></a>remnants of German philosophy are at present undergoing, one was more confused than the other.
      Instead of thoroughly studying the new science themselves to begin with, each of them preferred to trim it to fit
      the point of view he had brought along, made himself forthwith a private science of his own and at once came
      forward with the pretension of wanting to teach it.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch17--564"><a class="calibre14" id="ch17fn87"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch17fn87-r" id="ch17--566">87</a></sup>

<div class="noindentt" id="ch17--567">
      Thus they produce only “desperate confusion”: “Educative elements whose first principle is to teach what they
      have not learned can very well be dispensed with by the party.” Engels makes a similar remark in a letter
      attacking opportunist trends in the party on the issue of bimetallism. “But that’s our gentlemen the literati all
      over,” he adds. “Just like the bourgeois literati, they think they have the privilege of learning nothing and
      arguing about everything.” And he denounces their “economic ignorance, new-baked utopianism, and
      arrogance.”<sup class="calibre13" id="ch17--568"><a class="calibre14" id="ch17fn88"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch17fn88-r" id="ch17--570">88</a></sup>

<div class="indentb" id="ch17--571">
      Another overall charge made, especially by Engels, is that these bourgeois ideologues think they can manufacture
      intellectual productions simply out of <em class="calibre8" id="ch17--572">ideas</em>, rather than solid facts, information and
      concrete research leavened by theory.

<div class="bq" id="ch17--573">
      The people who do not want to learn anything on principle and only make literature about literature and,
      incidentally, out of literature (nine-tenths of present-day German scribbling is scribbling about other
      scribbling) naturally achieve more printed pages per year than those who grind away and are willing to write
      about other books only (1) if they have mastered these other books, and (2) if there is something in them worth

      serve for everything here and the result looks like it. It often seems as if these gentlemen think anything is
      good enough for the workers. If these gentlemen only knew that Marx thought his best things were still not good

      A correspondent’s letter to Engels once informed him that socialism could not be put into practice until there
      was a uniform level of education and reasoning ability, plainly implying that the mass of people were lacking in
      these qualities necessary for the leadership of society. Engels reacted sharply as usual to this sort of
      “supercilious snobbery” from intellectuals who, in his opinion, were still less fit to lead society, on both
      counts. The biggest obstacle, he replied, leaving aside the peasantry, is “the pushy, superclever educated
      people, who know how to do everything so much the better the less they understand it.”
    </div>
<div class="bqi" id="ch17--589">
      You speak of the absence of uniform reasoning ability. This exists—but on the part of the educated people
      stemming from aristocratic and bourgeois circles, who have no idea how much they still have to learn from the
      workers.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch17--590"><a class="calibre14" id="ch17fn92"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch17fn92-r" id="ch17--592">92</a></sup>

<h2 id="ch17lev7">7. THE STUDENTS</h2>
<div class="indent" id="ch17--594">
      There was no socialist student movement during most of Marx’s lifetime; the beginnings appeared by the end of the
      1870s, but the movement did not become significant until two decades later. Up to the 1860s student movements had
      played significant sociopolitical roles more than once, as in the case of the national-democratic
      Burschen-schaften of Germany in the first half of the century; but university students came overwhelmingly from
      bourgeois and aristocratic families and made little contact with socialist ideas.
    </div>
<div class="indent" id="ch17--595">
      Therefore there is little comment to be found in Marx or Engels on students as a distinctive group or factor in
      social or political life. Where students are mentioned at all it is simply as a type of educated bourgeois
      element in most cases. Indeed, more than once Marx uses the word <em class="calibre8" id="ch17--596">students</em> not for current
      university enrollees but as a generic term for educated elements who have long been out of school.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch17--597"><a class="calibre14" id="ch17fn93"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch17fn93-r" id="ch17--599">93</a></sup> His
      <em class="calibre8" id="ch17--600">Studiosus</em> and <em class="calibre8" id="ch17--601">Ex-Studiosus</em>, which formally meant <em class="calibre8" id="ch17--602">student</em> and <em class="calibre8" id="ch17--603">ex-student</em>, <a class="calibre6" id="page_535"></a>is virtually such a generic
      term for an academic or intellectual. (For example, he often tagged one of these labels onto Carl Schurz, whom he
      regarded as an especially contemptible type.)<sup class="calibre13" id="ch17--605"><a class="calibre14" id="ch17fn94"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch17fn94-r" id="ch17--607">94</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="indent" id="ch17--608">
      The main exception, both in social reality and in Marx’s and Engels’ writings, concerns the period of the
      revolution of 1848-1849, when a distinctive student presence cropped up in some places. This presence was
      observed in Engels’ main work on the revolution in Germany, in passages that are more descriptive than
      analytical. Engels notes both the strong and weak sides of student revolutionism.
    </div>
<div class="indentb" id="ch17--609">
      In Vienna, recounts Engels, bourgeois supremacy was based on the National Guard it had established and on a
      “Committee of Public Safety.”
    </div>
<div class="bq" id="ch17--610">
      °° But at the same time, the working classes were partially armed too; they and the students had borne the brunt
      of the fight, as far as fight there had been; and the students, about 4,000 strong, well armed and far better
      disciplined than the National Guard, formed the nucleus, the real strength of the revolutionary force, and were
      noways willing to act as a mere instrument in the hands of the Committee of Safety. Though they recognized it and
      even were its most enthusiastic supporters, they yet formed a sort of independent and rather turbulent body,
      deliberating for themselves in the “Aula,” keeping an intermediate position between the bourgeoisie and the
      working classes, preventing, by constant agitation, things to settle down to the old everyday tranquillity, and
      very often forcing their resolutions upon the Committee of Safety.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch17--611"><a class="calibre14" id="ch17fn95"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch17fn95-r" id="ch17--613">95</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="noindenttb" id="ch17--614">
      The workers also constituted a nuisance as far as the bourgeoisie was concerned, since keeping them employed at
      public works was expensive:
    </div>
<div class="bq" id="ch17--615">
      … trade was at a standstill, and the continuous agitation and excitement kept up by the students and working
      people was certainly not the means to “restore confidence,” as the phrase went. Thus, a certain coolness very
      soon sprung up between the middle classes on the one side, and the turbulent students and working people on the
      other …
    </div>
<div class="noindentb" id="ch17--616">
      But the alliance of the bourgeoisie with the students and workers was recemented by the counterattacks of the old
      regime’s forces.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch17--617"><a class="calibre14" id="ch17fn96"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch17fn96-r" id="ch17--619">96</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="indentb" id="ch17--620">
      The picture at this point, then, is of a student-worker alliance as the left wing of the revolution. But in the
      next stage, as the victorious <a class="calibre6" id="page_536"></a>bourgeoisie drew away from the workers in fear and the latter
      demanded military organization for themselves in distrust, “confusion and helplessness” reigned.
    </div>
<div class="bq" id="ch17--622">
      The Academic Legion, full of zeal for the struggle against imperial despotism, were entirely incapable of
      understanding the nature of the estrangement of the two classes, or of otherwise comprehending the necessities of
      the situation…. The council of the Academic Legion passed heroic resolutions, but was noways able to take the
      lead.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch17--623"><a class="calibre14" id="ch17fn97"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch17fn97-r" id="ch17--625">97</a></sup>

      The bourgeoisie backed off; but the working class could not take over; and the student forces were immobilized by
      incomprehension.

<div class="indentb" id="ch17--627">
      On the other hand, in Germany, when armed struggle broke out in May 1849, the student elements took an active
      part at first but lacked stick-to-it-iveness, unlike the core forces formed by the urban workers and the rural
      poor.
    </div>
<div class="bq" id="ch17--628">
      The greater part of the young men of all classes, below the capitalist class, was to be found, for a time at
      least, in the ranks of the insurgent armies, but this rather indiscriminate aggregate of young men very soon
      thinned as soon as the aspect of affairs took a somewhat serious turn. The students particularly, those
      “representatives of the intellect,” as they liked to call themselves, were the first to quit their standards,
      unless they were retained by the bestowal of officer’s rank, for which they, of course, had very seldom any
      qualification.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch17--629"><a class="calibre14" id="ch17fn98"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch17fn98-r" id="ch17--631">98</a></sup>

      The contrast between these German student forces and the Viennese was also made by Engels in his special account
      of this 1849 campaign, in which he served. In the Palatinate he noted the students’ penchant for adorning
      themselves, for lack of guns, with the dangling cavalry sabers that made a furious clatter in the streets as they
      were grandly dragged about by the “self-commissioned officers.”<sup class="calibre13" id="ch17--633"><a class="calibre14" id="ch17fn99"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch17fn99-r" id="ch17--635">99</a></sup> Later we get another vignette:
    </div>
<div class="bqi" id="ch17--636">
      In Bretten a delegation of students came to us with the declaration that this eternal marching-about in face of
      the enemy was not to their liking, and they requested release from service. The answer they got, of course, was
      that no one was released in face of the enemy, but if they wanted to desert they were free to do so. Thereupon
      about half the company marched off; the rest soon melted away through individual desertions till only the <a class="calibre6" id="page_537"></a>riflemen were left. In general, during the whole campaign the students showed themselves to be
      malcontent, nervous young gentlemen who always wanted to be let in on the operation plans but complained of
      wounded feet and grumbled if the campaign did not offer all the amenities of a vacation trip. Among these
      “representatives of intellect” there were only a few who constituted exceptions by virtue of their truly
      revolutionary character and splendid courage.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch17--638"><a class="calibre14" id="ch17fn100"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch17fn100-r" id="ch17--640">100</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="indentt" id="ch17--641">
      So much for the revolution. As with other social strata, the question mark over the students was not only their
      revolutionary consistency and stamina, but in particular their potentiality as an ally of the proletarian
      movement. We find this question coming up in the correspondence of Marx and Engels in the mid-1860s, not as a
      theorization but as an immediate practical problem. In France they saw anti-Bonaparte unrest gathering strength
      in both military and student ranks,<sup class="calibre13" id="ch17--642"><a class="calibre14" id="ch17en8-r"></a><a class="nounder2" href="43.html#ch17en8" id="ch17--644">*</a></sup> and both developments seemed to point to bourgeois disaffection from the
      regime. Marx commented that “The student business is a symptom of the worse marks of antagonisms in the army
      itself,”<sup class="calibre13" id="ch17--645"><a class="calibre14" id="ch17fn101"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch17fn101-r" id="ch17--647">101</a></sup> and Engels agreed, adding: “It is very important that the Paris students
      fight on the side of the proletariat, no matter how confused this may be in their own minds. The Ecole
      Polytechnique will follow soon enough.”<sup class="calibre13" id="ch17--648"><a class="calibre14" id="ch17fn102"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch17fn102-r" id="ch17--650">102</a></sup>

      But the issue of the student alliance did not loom very large until a mass socialist student movement began
      forming toward the end of the century, in the wake of the growing numbers and power of the parties of the Second
      International. Only a year before his death, Engels sent a message of cordial greetings to the first
      International Congress of Socialist Students held in Geneva. Its content is quite striking in terms of what it
      implies about the role he envisioned for the intellectual laborers in the productive process who are here called
      the “intellectual proletariat”:

      revolution, at the side of and in the midst of their brothers, the manual workers.

<div class="bqi" id="ch17--654">
      The bourgeois revolutions of the past required from the universities merely lawyers as the best raw material for
      politicians; the emancipation of the working class needs, besides, physicians, engineers, chemists, agronomists
      and other specialists; for it is a question not only of leading in the political machinery but also of taking the
      entire production of society in hand; and here, in place of high-sounding phrases, solid knowledge is
      needed.<sup class="calibre13" id="ch17--655"><a class="calibre14" id="ch17fn103"></a><a class="nounder2" href="39_split_001.html#ch17fn103-r" id="ch17--657">103</a></sup>
</div>
<div class="indentt" id="ch17--658">
      What this says diplomatically—by pitching it in positive terms—is that students in general should <em class="calibre8" id="ch17--659">not</em> expect to become the political leaders of the proletariat but rather specialists and
      technicians of the sort needed by the revolutionary society, contributing not “high-sounding phrases” but “solid
      knowledge.” It points to a limited role for them as a social type, as we might expect in view of Engels’ opinions
      on and experience with intellectuals.
