      If the radical Hegelian D. F. Strauss preferred the old police state to a proliferation of beards, some
      trivialogists may suspect that Engels preserved his beard in order to encourage the overthrow of the state. When
      his beard had achieved the sage gray color we know from photographs, Engels liked to regale his London friends
      (so we are told by the English socialist E. B. Bax) with the hairy tale
    </div>

    <div class="bq" id="noted--6">
      of how he, wearing a beard, at that time regarded as a great eccentricity, being worn by few Englishmen, when he
      went out for a stroll on Sunday morning would meet occasionally a fellow bearded man, who would greet him with
      something like religious fervour.<sup id="noted--7" class="calibre13"><a id="notedfn1" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="noted--9" href="1.html#notedfn1-r">1</a></sup>

      On the other hand, in 1852 Marx and Engels had written in their most forgettable joint work that a certain German
      liberal retired for a while “in order to grow a beard, without which no prophet can succeed.”<sup id="noted--11" class="calibre13"><a id="notedfn2" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="noted--13" href="1.html#notedfn2-r">2</a></sup> This was
      a hoary as well as hirsute quip.
    </div>

    <div class="indentb" id="noted--14">
      The truth is that Engels’ pogonophilia had begun well before the revolution, in a year that saw the first
      stirrings of German bourgeois liberalism, 1840. Not yet twenty years old, working as a commercial apprentice with
      a Bremen firm, young Friedrich wrote home to his sister about the latest revolt of youth:
    </div>

    <div class="bq" id="noted--15">
      Last Sunday we had a mustache-evening … I sent out a circular to all young people able to raise a mustache,
      saying it was high time to challenge all the philistines and the best way to do it was to wear mustaches. Whoever
      had courage enough to defy the philistines and wear a mustache was to sign up. Right away I got together a dozen
      mustaches; and October 25, when our mustaches became a month old, was set for a collective mustache-jubilee.
    </div>

    <div class="noindenttb" id="noted--16">
      In the course of this mustache orgy, young Engels stood to propose the following toast:

      At ten o’clock, some of the insurrectionists had to leave because they did not have a house key and would be
      locked out; but Engels and others of the hard core stayed at the Rathskeller where the uprising was taking place.
      Engels defiantly ate eight oysters even though he didn’t like them.<sup id="noted--33" class="calibre13"><a id="notedfn3" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="noted--35" href="1.html#notedfn3-r">3</a></sup>

    <div class="indentb" id="noted--36">
      How the counterrevolution took place is not known, but three and a half months later Engels eliminated the
      face-fleece. Then there was a sharp revulsion and the pendulum swung back to rebellion. He wrote his sister:
    </div>

    <div class="bqi" id="noted--37">
      Today I shaved off my mustache and buried its youthful corpse amidst grievous lamentations.… Now I’m going to let
      it grow back again, for I certainly can’t let myself be seen anywhere. At the singing-school I was the only one
      with a mustache and I always made fun of the philistines who never got over their astonishment that I could have
      the effrontery to go into respectable society so unshaven. However, the ladies found it very pleasing, and my old
      man too.<sup id="noted--38" class="calibre13"><a id="notedfn4" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="noted--40" href="1.html#notedfn4-r">4</a></sup>
    </div>

    <div class="noindentt" id="noted--41">
      Two and a half weeks later he reported that the mustache “is now once again in full bloom, flourishing,” and that
      he would not shave it off “even to please a king.”<sup id="noted--42" class="calibre13"><a id="notedfn5" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="noted--44" href="1.html#notedfn5-r">5</a></sup> Alas, even by May it had not regained its pristine splendor;
      and we also learn of a factor he had not previously mentioned: “I would look interesting perhaps,” he wrote his
      sister, “if, instead of my presently young mustache, I still had my old Bremen mustache and my growth of long
      hair.”<sup id="noted--45" class="calibre13"><a id="notedfn6" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="noted--47" href="1.html#notedfn6-r">6</a></sup>

    <div class="indent" id="noted--48">
      So ends the shaggy story of Engels’ first rebellion.
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="noted--49">
      The following year, young Marx, writing his first article for the <em id="noted--50" class="calibre8">Rheinische Zeitung</em>
      against the censorship of the press, let his hair down in an attempt to touch the hearts of his readers. “You
      consider it despotic to cut a free man’s hair against his will,” he wrote, “but the <a id="page_598" class="calibre6"></a>censorship daily carves the flesh of thinking people …”<sup id="noted--52" class="calibre13"><a id="notedfn7" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="noted--54" href="1.html#notedfn7-r">7</a></sup> We do not know why this
      anguished comparison was on his mind, or how much hair was on his head, at this time. About six years before,
      while he was a student at Bonn, a group portrait of the Trier Students Association on the campus had shown that
      he was probably the hairiest of the lot.<sup id="noted--55" class="calibre13"><a id="notedfn8" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="noted--57" href="1.html#notedfn8-r">8</a></sup> We may never know whether any despot wanted to cut his hair
      against his will. But then, nobody even knows whether Adam was created with a full-grown beard.
