    A note to <a class="nounder4" id="noteg--4" href="A01_TitlePage.html#ch15">Chapter 15</a>, page 453</h2>

    <div class="indent" id="noteg--5">
      Unfortunately, as far as I know there is no inquiry into the origin of the German term <em id="noteg--6" class="calibre8">Lumpenproletariat.</em> Pending research by someone competent in German philology, the following
      remarks must be tentative; but they may help to erase certain common misconceptions, which in turn have favored
      common mistranslations whenever an attempt has been made to find a vernacular equivalent. It is only in recent
      times that English translations or citations have begun to naturalize the word (not capitalized) with any
      frequency.
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="noteg--7">
      Was Marx, in <em id="noteg--8" class="calibre8">The German Ideology</em>, the first to use the term? Certainly no prior use has
      been recorded. Yet this first use by Marx does not sound consciously innovative, arising rather fortuitously out
      of a dialogue with Max Stirner’s <em id="noteg--9" class="calibre8">The Ego and His Own</em>, which had been published less than a
      year before the writing of <em id="noteg--10" class="calibre8">The German Ideology</em> began.<sup id="noteg--11" class="calibre13"><a id="notegfn1" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="noteg--13" href="1.html#notegfn1-r">1</a></sup> As far as I can make out,
      it happened in the following way.
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="noteg--14">
      The word <em id="noteg--15" class="calibre8">Lumpen</em> (plural: same) means <em id="noteg--16" class="calibre8">rag.</em> By extension it began
      to mean <em id="noteg--17" class="calibre8">person in rags</em>, and, by a common twist Marxists will understand, its meaning
      darkened from <em id="noteg--18" class="calibre8">ragamuffin</em> to <em id="noteg--19" class="calibre8">bad person, riffraff, knave</em>.<sup id="noteg--20" class="calibre13"><a id="notegfn2" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="noteg--22" href="1.html#notegfn2-r">2</a></sup> But in
      this latter usage, by the eighteenth century or earlier, it mutated to <em id="noteg--23" class="calibre8">Lump</em> (plural:
      <em id="noteg--24" class="calibre8">Lumpen</em>, formerly also <em id="noteg--25" class="calibre8">Lumpe</em> as in Stirner). This form gave rise
      to a large number of pejorative and invective terms, beginning with <em id="noteg--26" class="calibre8">Lumpen-</em> as the
      combining form. But these <em id="noteg--27" class="calibre8">Lumpen</em>-words were formed from <em id="noteg--28" class="calibre8">Lump</em>, not
      from <em id="noteg--29" class="calibre8">Lumpen</em> (which had its own combinations, such as <em id="noteg--30" class="calibre8">Lumpensammler</em>, rag-picker).
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="noteg--31">
      The important conclusion that follows is that the governing meaning of the pejorative prefix to <em id="noteg--32" class="calibre8">Lumpenproletariat</em> is related not to rags but to <em id="noteg--33" class="calibre8">bad people</em>.<sup id="noteg--34" class="calibre13"><a id="notegfn3" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="noteg--36" href="1.html#notegfn3-r">3</a></sup> Yet the
      common assumption has been that it means <em id="noteg--37" class="calibre8">rags, tatters</em>, and the result has been the
      widespread and misleading translation “tatterdemalion proletariat,” “proletariat in rags,” “<em id="noteg--38" class="calibre8">proletariat en haillons</em>,” and the like, all of which stress extreme poverty; hence also “slum
      proletariat,” which is equally misleading. But, as <a class="nounder1" id="noteg--39" href="A01_TitlePage.html#ch15">Chapter
      15</a> shows, it is not poverty that defines the lumpenproletariat <a id="page_629" class="calibre6"></a>and accounts for Marx’s
      and Engels’ usages. One of the unfortunate consequences of such translations is that they reinforce the erroneous
      conception of the lumpenproletariat as a part of the proletariat, the most depressed part.
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="noteg--41">
      In the century before Marx, large numbers of <em id="noteg--42" class="calibre8">Lumpen</em> -combinations were already in use for
      a variety of depreciatory and vituperative purposes. There is a longer list of such words in a 1716 lexicon and
      in the 1820 Heinsius dictionary than in most modern works,<sup id="noteg--43" class="calibre13"><a id="notegfn4" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="noteg--45" href="1.html#notegfn4-r">4</a></sup> and the list makes clear that <em id="noteg--46" class="calibre8">Lumpen</em> -could be freely tacked on to almost any word ad hoc: <em id="noteg--47" class="calibre8">Lumpenfrau,
      Lumpenkönig, Lumpenbuch, Lumpen-hranzösisch</em>, and so on. There were undoubtedly scores of such combinations
      that no dictionary felt obliged to record; that is, the door was wide open to the ad hoc formation of <em id="noteg--48" class="calibre8">Lumpen</em> -words. This is why Marx, in 1845, did not have to feel he was inventing a new technical
      term when he prefixed this common pejorative to a less common word, <em id="noteg--49" class="calibre8">proletariat</em>.<a id="notegen1-r" class="calibre6"></a><a class="nounder1" id="noteg--51" href="1.html#notegen1">*</a>
    </div>

    <h3 class="h3a" id="noteglev1">1. A LUMPEN-LEXICON</h3>

    <div class="indent" id="noteg--53">
      Marx’s first use of the combined term is in <em id="noteg--54" class="calibre8">The German Ideology</em>, in two distinct
      passages: in Parti, called “Feuerbach,” and in <a class="nounder1" id="noteg--55" href="A03_Dedication.html#part02">Part
      II</a>, <a class="nounder1" id="noteg--56" href="1.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>, called “Saint Max” (on Max Stirner).
      Although Part 1 was started first, we know that “the order of the text that appears in the published form does
      not at all correspond to the chronological writing of the manuscript.”<sup id="noteg--57" class="calibre13"><a id="notegfn8" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="noteg--59" href="1.html#notegfn8-r">8</a></sup> There is a distinct
      possibility—only a possibility in the absence of definite information one way or the other—that the passage on
      Stirner was written before the other. Even if this is not so, there can be little doubt that the Stirner material
      involved here was already in Marx’s mind when he began writing. Over three-quarters of <a id="page_630" class="calibre6"></a>the
      long first volume of <em id="noteg--61" class="calibre8">The German Ideology</em> is on Stirner (omitted from most English
      editions of the work).
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="noteg--62">
      This is important, and may be decisive, since Stirner’s book makes frequent use of <em id="noteg--63" class="calibre8">Lump</em>
      and its compounds, especially <em id="noteg--64" class="calibre8">Lumperei</em>, for the purpose of labeling social phenomena. On
      the one hand, he uses these words in senses that are close to meaning <em id="noteg--65" class="calibre8">Lumpenproletariat;</em>
      on the other hand, he more than once uses <em id="noteg--66" class="calibre8">Proletariat</em> with the same import. To be sure,
      he does not happen to prefix <em id="noteg--67" class="calibre8">Lumpen-</em> to the word <em id="noteg--68" class="calibre8">Proletariat</em>, but
      his failure to do so is almost accidental, so often do the two elements flirt with each other on the wings of
      Stirner’s rhetoric.<a id="notegen2-r" class="calibre6"></a><a class="nounder1" id="noteg--70" href="1.html#notegen2">*</a> The
      flirtation becomes hottest on one page of Stirner’s section on “Political Liberalism,” <em id="noteg--71" class="calibre8">and
      Marx’s use of the term</em> Lumpenproletariat <em id="noteg--72" class="calibre8">occurs as he is discussing the content of this
      page.</em>
    </div>

    <div class="indentb" id="noteg--73">
      The context amply explains how the term comes off Marx’s pen. Stirner’s passage begins with an invocation of
      precisely those social elements who would be called lumpenproletarian. The bourgeois, he writes, grow morally
      indignant at shady elements:
    </div>

    <div class="bqt" id="noteg--74">
      the sharper, the demirep, the thief, robber, and murderer, the gambler, the penniless man without an established
      situation, the frivolous man … All these lack settlement … in short, they belong, because their existence does
      not rest on a <em id="noteg--75" class="calibre8">secure basis</em>, to the dangerous “individuals or isolated persons,” to the
      dangerous <em id="noteg--76" class="calibre8">proletariat;</em> they … have “nothing to lose,” and so nothing to risk.… They form
      the class of the unstable, restless, changeable, i.e., of the proletarians, and, if they give voice to their
      unsettled nature, are called “unruly fellows.”
    </div>

    <div class="bqi2" id="noteg--77">
      This is the broad sense of the so-called proletariat or pauperism.<sup id="noteg--78" class="calibre13"><a id="notegfn10" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="noteg--80" href="1.html#notegfn10-r">10</a></sup>
    </div>

    <div class="indentt" id="noteg--81">
      Marx cites parts of this passage and proceeds to attack Stirner’s identification of the proletariat with these
      elements, and especially with pauperism as such. He explains that “pauperism is the position only of the ruined
      proletariat, the lowest level to which the proletarian sinks …” For Stirner, the <em id="noteg--82" class="calibre8">entire</em>
      proletariat consists of ruined individuals, “of a collection of <em id="noteg--83" class="calibre8">ragamuffins [Lumpen]</em>, who
      have existed in every epoch and whose existence <em id="noteg--84" class="calibre8">on a mass scale</em> after the decline of the
      Middle Ages preceded the mass formation of the ordinary proletariat, as Saint Max [Stirner] can ascertain by a
      perusal of English and French <a id="page_631" class="calibre6"></a>legislation and literature.”<sup id="noteg--86" class="calibre13"><a id="notegfn11" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="noteg--88" href="1.html#notegfn11-r">11</a></sup> Note that later this
      historical precedent is given by Marx and Engels as the origin of the lumpenproletariat; at this point, this
      social element is simply called the <em id="noteg--89" class="calibre8">Lumpen</em>. Here we have a confirmation of the fact that
      the <em id="noteg--90" class="calibre8">Lumpe(n</em>) so freely described by Stirner are to be equated with the lumpenproletariat
      as later understood by Marx. <em id="noteg--91" class="calibre8">And indeed in the very next paragraph, when these elements are
      referred to again, Marx’s pen writes</em> Lumpenproletariat <em id="noteg--92" class="calibre8">instead of</em> Lumpe(n).<a id="notegen3-r" class="calibre6"></a><a class="nounder1" id="noteg--94" href="1.html#notegen3">*</a>
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="noteg--95">
      This occurs as Marx makes the point that Stirner changes his use of <em id="noteg--96" class="calibre8">Proletariat</em> from the
      previously described <em id="noteg--97" class="calibre8">Lumpe</em> to the real proletariat, the real workers. “This,” writes
      Marx, “occurs on pages 151 and 152,<sup id="noteg--98" class="calibre13"><a id="notegfn14" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="noteg--100" href="1.html#notegfn14-r">14</a></sup> where the lumpenproletariat becomes transformed into ‘workers,’ into
      ordinary proletarians …”<sup id="noteg--101" class="calibre13"><a id="notegfn15" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="noteg--103" href="1.html#notegfn15-r">15</a></sup>
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="noteg--104">
      There it is: the formation <em id="noteg--105" class="calibre8">Lumpenproletariat</em> slips out almost unawares, as simply
      another one of the several combinations with <em id="noteg--106" class="calibre8">Lumpen-</em> that are before Marx’s eyes at this
      moment, <em id="noteg--107" class="calibre8">Lumperei, Lumpengesindel, Lumpengesellschaft</em>, all frequently used by Stirner.
      Where Stirner had used <em id="noteg--108" class="calibre8">Lumpe</em> to signify his idea of the proletariat, Marx simply spelled
      out Stirner’s thought, which makes this connection time and again.<sup id="noteg--109" class="calibre13"><a id="notegfn16" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="noteg--111" href="1.html#notegfn16-r">16</a></sup> It must be understood
      that when Marx writes <em id="noteg--112" class="calibre8">Lumpenproletariat</em> at this point, he is still referring to
      Stirner’s line of thought, not his own.
    </div>

    <div class="indentb" id="noteg--113">
      But—as Marx mentioned in this same passage—Stirner’s rhetoric did not invent this social element; it only played
      with it. This social element <em id="noteg--114" class="calibre8">had</em> played a mass historical role, precisely in the
      formation of the real proletariat, during the transition from the Middle Ages to the present bourgeois era. Going
      even further back, it could also be discerned in mass in Roman society. This is the connection in which it is
      mentioned in the first chapter of <em id="noteg--115" class="calibre8">The German Ideology</em>, which may or may not have been
      written before the Stirner passage:
    </div>

    <div class="bq" id="noteg--116">
      The [Roman] plebeians, midway between freemen and slaves, never succeeded in becoming more than a
      lumpenproletariat.<sup id="noteg--117" class="calibre13"><a id="notegfn17" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="noteg--119" href="1.html#notegfn17-r">17</a></sup>
    </div>

    <div class="noindentt" id="noteg--120">
      And with this statement, already quoted in <a class="nounder1" id="noteg--121" href="A01_TitlePage.html#ch15">Chapter 15</a>,
      the term started its career as the label of a class or class element.
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="noteg--122">
      We may mention in this connection that forty years later Engels still <a id="page_632" class="calibre6"></a>identified the
      so-called proletariat of the latter-day Roman empire as a lumpenproletariat:
    </div>

    <div class="bq" id="noteg--124">
      In contrast [with the slaves of the plantation economy] were the free proletarians—however, not <em id="noteg--125" class="calibre8">working</em> but <em id="noteg--126" class="calibre8">lumpen</em>proletariat. Today in ever-increasing extent society
      is based on the labor of the proletarians …; the Roman lumpenproletarians were parasites, not only useless but
      even detrimental to the society and hence without any decisive power.<sup id="noteg--127" class="calibre13"><a id="notegfn17a" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="noteg--129" href="1.html#notegfn17-ra">17a</a></sup>
    </div>

    <h3 class="h3a" id="noteglev2">2. THE TRANSLATION PROBLEM</h3>

    <div class="indent" id="noteg--131">
      The career of mistranslations, or misleading translations, of the German word <em id="noteg--132" class="calibre8">Lumpenproletariat</em> started with the passage in the <em id="noteg--133" class="calibre8">Communist Manifesto.</em>
      The difficulty was that the word was as untranslatable as could be, since no word existed in English (or French
      or any other language) for this hitherto unlabeled social formation. Translators were understandably reluctant to
      adopt one of the two satisfactory solutions: naturalization (as is becoming common today), or invention of a
      brand-new term. But an old word or term could not fail to be misleading.
    </div>

    <div class="indentb" id="noteg--134">
      The first attempt was made in the first English translation of the Manifesto, by Helen Macfarlane, published in
      1850 in Harney’s <em id="noteg--135" class="calibre8">Red Republican</em>—that is, under circumstances suggesting that the authors
      of the Manifesto may have helped the enterprise.<a id="notegen4-r" class="calibre6"></a><a class="nounder1" id="noteg--137" href="1.html#notegen4">*</a> The Macfarlane translation <a id="page_633" class="calibre6"></a>dealt with <em id="noteg--139" class="calibre8">Lumpenproletariat</em> in the same way that Marx and Engels did more than once later: it made it
      <em id="noteg--140" class="calibre8">mob.</em>
    </div>

    <div class="bqi" id="noteg--141">
      The Mob,—this product of the decomposition of the lowest substrata of the old Social system,—is partly forced
      into the revolutionary Proletarian movement. The social position of this portion of the people makes it, however,
      in general a ready and venal tool for Reactionist intrigues.<sup id="noteg--142" class="calibre13"><a id="notegfn21" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="noteg--144" href="1.html#notegfn21-r">21</a></sup>
    </div>

    <div class="noindentt" id="noteg--145">
      We should keep in mind that at the time <em id="noteg--146" class="calibre8">mob</em> was still often used to mean not merely a
      tumultuous crowd but also a class or social stratum in a loose sense,<sup id="noteg--147" class="calibre13"><a id="notegfn22" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="noteg--149" href="1.html#notegfn22-r">22</a></sup> very like the old
      usage of <em id="noteg--150" class="calibre8">proletariat</em> or, later, <em id="noteg--151" class="calibre8">the masses.</em> It was for its day
      a better translation than any subsequently devised, even if not entirely adequate.<a id="notegen5-r" class="calibre6"></a><a class="nounder1" id="noteg--153" href="1.html#notegen5">*</a> We should also note that the
      phrase “this portion of the people”—added by the translator, probably to avoid a pronoun with indefinite
      antecedent—does not represent this mob-element to be a portion of the proletariat.
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="noteg--154">
      When Samuel Moore did the now standard English translation of 1888, with Engels editing the product, the result
      was much less happy. However, the Moore-Engels version did <em id="noteg--155" class="calibre8">not</em> use a phrase implying a
      part of the proletariat—the error that proliferated later; it used nothing like “tatterdemalion proletariat,”
      “slum proletariat,” and such. It turned <em id="noteg--156" class="calibre8">Lumpenproletariat</em> into two terms: “The
      ‘dangerous class,’ the social scum …”<sup id="noteg--157" class="calibre13"><a id="notegfn26" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="noteg--159" href="1.html#notegfn26-r">26</a></sup>
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="noteg--160">
      “Social scum” is to the point, and is dealt with in <a class="nounder1" id="noteg--161" href="A01_TitlePage.html#ch15">Chapter 15</a>. But it is quite another matter with “dangerous class”—and still worse with the
      plural “the ‘dangerous’ classes” which is used in the Moore-Aveling-Engels translation of the first volume of
      <em id="noteg--162" class="calibre8">Capital</em>.<sup id="noteg--163" class="calibre13"><a id="notegfn27" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="noteg--165" href="1.html#notegfn27-r">27</a></sup> The Manifesto translation even puts it in quote marks, thus pointing to
      its past use. But its use had usually been to impeach the working class, or the lower <a id="page_634" class="calibre6"></a>classes in general, as a “danger” to society because of susceptibility to revolution, anarchy, and
      other iniquities. “Dangerous classes” was used to blur the difference between workers and the “criminal classes,”
      between the proletariat and the “social scum.”<sup id="noteg--167" class="calibre13"><a id="notegfn28" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="noteg--169" href="1.html#notegfn28-r">28</a></sup> It was perhaps Lorenz von Stein’s influential 1842 book on
      French socialism that had started the theme; the modern proletariat, he wrote, “has to be called dangerous:
      dangerous by virtue of its numbers and the bold mettle it has often shown, dangerous by virtue of its
      consciousness of unity, finally, dangerous by virtue of its feeling that only through revolution can it achieve
      the realization of its designs.”<sup id="noteg--170" class="calibre13"><a id="notegfn29" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="noteg--172" href="1.html#notegfn29-r">29</a></sup> Stirner’s book, as we saw, also referred to the “dangerous proletariat,”
      perhaps echoing Stein, but not clearly referring to the modern working class as Stein had done.<sup id="noteg--173" class="calibre13"><a id="notegfn30" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="noteg--175" href="1.html#notegfn30-r">30</a></sup> The
      “dangerous” tag became a well-known phrase, expressing the horror of ruling-class respectability at the menacing
      miasma exhaling from the dark underworld of society.
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="noteg--176">
      No doubt the phrase was also extensively used for the dubious lumpen-elements; in fact, Marx himself used it this
      way in his second draft of <em id="noteg--177" class="calibre8">The Civil War in France</em>.<a id="notegen6-r" class="calibre6"></a><a class="nounder1" id="noteg--179" href="1.html#notegen6">*</a> To be sure, “dangerous class” certainly reflected Marx’s
      opinion of these elements. But the public career of this phrase made it ambiguous and misleading as a rendering
