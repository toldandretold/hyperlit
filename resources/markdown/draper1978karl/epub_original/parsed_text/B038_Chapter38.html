    <div class="indent2" id="notej--5">
      In the marxological package of myths about Marx’s line in 1848, one of the items is the claim that Marx was not
      concerned with the building of workers’ organizations at the beginning of the revolution and during its first
      months, but only made a turn in this direction in early 1849 when he resigned from the Democratic
      Association.<a id="notejen1-r" class="calibre4"></a><a class="nounder4" id="notej--7" href="1.html#notejen1">*</a> This claim is
      obviously related to the similar fiction which has it (following Nicolaievsky and others) that the <em id="notej--8" class="calibre19">N.R.Z.</em> did not concern itself with working-class issues and interests until late 1848 or early
      1849.<sup id="notej--9" class="calibre20"><a id="notejfn3" class="calibre4"></a><a class="nounder4" id="notej--11" href="1.html#notejfn3-r">3</a></sup>
    </div>

    <div class="indent2" id="notej--12">
      On the contrary, we will now see that Marx’s <em id="notej--13" class="calibre19">first</em> concern, directly after the outbreak
      of the revolution in Berlin, was the expansion and link-up of workers’ organizations throughout Germany.<sup id="notej--14" class="calibre20"><a id="notejfn4" class="calibre4"></a><a class="nounder4" id="notej--16" href="1.html#notejfn4-r">4</a></sup>

    <div class="indent2" id="notej--17">
      It is important to understand, as the mythologists do not, that Marx did not counterpose workers’ organization
      against Democratic organization during this whole period: they complemented each other, in his view, and required
      a division of labor from his supporters. Indeed, this was essentially true for Marx already before the
      revolution. In Brussels, where Marx and Engels were working when the revolution broke out, Marx had already
      worked out a two-tiered organizational policy. He had been instrumental in founding, and was active in building,
      two movements: both a Democratic Association and a workers’ movement, the latter being further divisible into a
      Communist core group and its front organization, a broad workers’ educational society. In Brussels <a id="page_661" class="calibre4"></a>Marx could be personally active in both because the pressure of revolutionary events did not yet
      exist. Later, in Cologne, he could not be equally active in both; but this does not affect the principle of the
      thing. His group <em id="notej--19" class="calibre19">was</em> active in both.<sup id="notej--20" class="calibre20"><a id="notejfn5" class="calibre4"></a><a class="nounder4" id="notej--22" href="1.html#notejfn5-r">5</a></sup>
    </div>

    <div class="indent2" id="notej--23">
      Both in prerevolutionary Brussels and in revolutionary Cologne, the Marx group as a political tendency carried
      out a division of labor in founding and building both a workers’ association and a Democratic club. This course
      had been prefigured in the <em id="notej--24" class="calibre19">Communist Manifesto.</em> However, the question of
      which-to-build-when does not depend only on policies or theories: it is also a practical question, a question of
      how much is feasible in one or the other field at a given moment.

    <div class="indent2" id="notej--25">
      Upon the outbreak of the revolution in Paris in February, and the subsequent expulsion of Marx from Belgium, the
      leading committee of the Communist League was transferred to Paris, as the center of the revolution; in this
      connection it decided to give Marx “full discretionary power” to direct the organization’s work in the
      emergency.<sup id="notej--26" class="calibre20"><a id="notejfn6" class="calibre4"></a><a class="nounder4" id="notej--28" href="1.html#notejfn6-r">6</a></sup> From March 4 to the end of the month, then, Marx was in direct charge of the
      League’s work. In the middle of the month the revolution spread to Austria and Germany. The preparatory stay in
      Paris—the most important center of the German emigration<sup id="notej--29" class="calibre20"><a id="notejfn7" class="calibre4"></a><a class="nounder4" id="notej--31" href="1.html#notejfn7-r">7</a></sup>—was necessary in order to mobilize the German
      émigrés influenced by the League for an organized return to Germany. The period was used by Marx both to organize
      the Germans in Paris, and also to send advance organizers into Germany.
    </div>

    <div class="indent2" id="notej--32">
      First: about organization in Paris. The existing four Paris sections of the Communist League were consolidated.
      At a meeting of the leading committee on March 8, the main item of business was the immediate formation of a
      German Workers’ Club, an open and public organization for a working-class membership broader than the League
      itself.<a id="notejen2-r" class="calibre4"></a><a class="nounder4" id="notej--34" href="1.html#notejen2">*</a> Marx was assigned
      to draft its statutes, and he submitted his draft to another meeting held the very next day: such was the urgency
      of this step.<sup id="notej--35" class="calibre20"><a id="notejfn9" class="calibre4"></a><a class="nounder4" id="notej--37" href="1.html#notejfn9-r">9</a></sup>
    </div>

    <div class="indent2" id="notej--38">
      What about a Democratic Association of German émigrés? One had already been formed in Paris, and its influence
      was a pernicious one. Led by Bornstedt and Herwegh, it took a weak bourgeois-republican stance in politics, and,
      much worse, was mainly engaged in organizing an adventurist “German Legion” which was to invade the homeland
      bearing the revolution on its bayonets, financed by French gold.<sup id="notej--39" class="calibre20"><a id="notejfn10" class="calibre4"></a><a class="nounder4" id="notej--41" href="1.html#notejfn10-r">10</a></sup> To <a id="page_662" class="calibre4"></a>Marx and the Communist League, this was as false politically as it was farcical militarily. One of
      the reasons the German Workers’ Club was needed in a hurry was to mobilize the Paris Germans for an entirely
      different course, opposed to that of the Democratic Association. In short, in this first (Paris) period of the
      revolution, Marx had to organize a workers’ association <em id="notej--43" class="calibre19">as against</em> the existing
      Democratic Association. There might have been a point to helping a German Democratic Association in Paris only if
      some elements were found there who were sympathetic but unwilling to organize in a workers’ group; but this is an
      academic question since the Democratic slot was pre-empted by the Bornstedt-Herwegh types.
    </div>

    <div class="indent2" id="notej--44">
      Under the existing circumstances, Marx went to considerable effort to advertise, through correspondence and in
      the German and French press, that the workers’ club had nothing to do with the Democratic Association and its
      Legion scheme. The longest explanation, written for Marx by his wife, went to Weydemeyer in Germany, asking him
      to spread this information in his own paper and to as many other German papers as possible.<sup id="notej--45" class="calibre20"><a id="notejfn11" class="calibre4"></a><a class="nounder4" id="notej--47" href="1.html#notejfn11-r">11</a></sup> Marx
      and the League committee put out a statement in French for the Paris press, along the same lines.<sup id="notej--48" class="calibre20"><a id="notejfn12" class="calibre4"></a><a class="nounder4" id="notej--50" href="1.html#notejfn12-r">12</a></sup>
    </div>

    <div class="indent2" id="notej--51">
      In contrast, Marx’s aim was to mobilize German revolutionaries in Paris to go home without public fanfare but
      with links established among themselves (preferably through the Communist League) that would facilitate their
      organized activity once they got into the movement at home. In point of fact, the League got three or four
      hundred to return to Germany under its aegis.<sup id="notej--52" class="calibre20"><a id="notejfn13" class="calibre4"></a><a class="nounder4" id="notej--54" href="1.html#notejfn13-r">13</a></sup> In terms of this course, the organizational program was the
      establishment of workers’ associations as widely as possible and their speedy link-up into a national
      organization. This was started by the Communist League in Paris under Marx’s leadership. The political program
      for this effort was drafted around March 21-29 in the shape of the seventeen “Demands of the Communist Party in
      Germany,” whose content has already been discussed in <a class="nounder4" id="notej--55" href="A01_TitlePage.html#ch07">Chapter 7</a>.<sup id="notej--56" class="calibre20"><a id="notejfn14" class="calibre4"></a><a class="nounder4" id="notej--58" href="1.html#notejfn14-r">14</a></sup> It was published as a leaflet by the end of the month, republished in a number
      of German papers, and widely used by Communist League organizers and by Marx’s group in Cologne.<a id="notejen3-r" class="calibre4"></a><a class="nounder4" id="notej--60" href="1.html#notejen3">*</a> For present purposes we need
      only remind that its heavy emphasis was on demands <a id="page_663" class="calibre4"></a>of interest to workers and peasants, and
      secondarily to the petty-bourgeois component of the Democratic alliance.
    </div>

    <div class="indent2" id="notej--62">
      With these goals the Communist League under Marx sent a number of organizers into Germany as advance emissaries.
      Karl Wallau was sent back to his home town, Mainz, before the end of March. Wallau was a member of the League
      central committee who had already worked closely with Marx in Brussels, as president of the German workers’
      association in that city. For Marx he was an ideal emissary. In Mainz, working with Adolph Cluss and others, he
      promptly founded a workers’ association. Wilhelm Wolff, Marx’s close associate and friend,<sup id="notej--63" class="calibre20"><a id="notejfn20" class="calibre4"></a><a class="nounder4" id="notej--65" href="1.html#notejfn20-r">20</a></sup> came
      by on April 3 and helped the Mainz people draft an appeal to other cities. The Mainz Appeal, issued on April 5,
      called for the formation of workers’ associations throughout Germany, with the Mainz group acting as temporary
      center for responses, preliminary to forming a real nationwide organization and central committee.
    </div>

    <div class="indent2" id="notej--66">
      On April 8, Marx and Engels, on their way from Paris to Cologne, stopped at Mainz for a couple of days and went
      over these plans with Wallau and Mainz activists.<sup id="notej--67" class="calibre20"><a id="notejfn21" class="calibre4"></a><a class="nounder4" id="notej--69" href="1.html#notejfn21-r">21</a></sup> Among the plans discussed, no doubt, was the spreading of the
      Mainz Appeal for the formation of workers’ associations. It was widely reprinted, mainly in papers in western and
      southern Germany. In leaflet form, it was sent to workers’ organizations <a id="page_664" class="calibre4"></a>all over the
      country. As Communist League organizers passed through Mainz, they took away batches of copies which they spread
      wherever they went; Wolff distributed copies even on a Rhine steamer and a railway train.
    </div>

    <div class="indent2" id="notej--71">
      Wolff had left Mainz on the 6th, before Marx arrived, and went on to Cologne. In Cologne, he gave the Mainz
      Appeal directly to Dr. Gottschalk, the philanthropic physician who was engaged in organizing a new association in
      the city. The Cologne workers’ association was founded on the 13th; it adopted an “address” acknowledging the
      Mainz initiative and definitely stating that “we too … established ourselves as a workers’ association after the
      example of our sister city Mainz.” Gottschalk had <em id="notej--72" class="calibre19">not</em> wanted the new group to be a
      workers’ association; characteristically, as we have seen,<sup id="notej--73" class="calibre20"><a id="notejfn22" class="calibre4"></a><a class="nounder4" id="notej--75" href="1.html#notejfn22-r">22</a></sup> he wanted the Cologne group to call itself a
      “Democratic-Socialist Club” instead. He was defeated on this proposal, showing that his politics were implicitly
      repudiated by the membership even before his personal popularity started to fade. The reference to the example of
      Mainz—that is, of Marx’s organizational line—had to do with the open class character of the organization
      established.
    </div>

    <div class="indent2" id="notej--76">
      Wallau was only the first of the Communist League activists to go back into Germany, on the initiative of the
      Paris leadership under Marx, as advance field organizers with the perspective of building a nationwide workers’
      association movement, as well as of recruiting League members where possible. There were a number of others, from
      the end of March through April and partly into May. Karl Schapper covered Wiesbaden and Hesse-Nassau. Weydemeyer
      was active in Hamm; F. A. Bergmann in Regensburg. Stephen Born went to Berlin and stayed there, losing his
      Communist politics in the course of his individual work. Wilhelm Wolff went not only to Mainz and Cologne, but
      also to Coblenz, Hanover, Berlin, and Breslau, and then worked in Silesia for some months (without dissolving his
      revolutionary politics).<sup id="notej--77" class="calibre20"><a id="notejfn23" class="calibre4"></a><a class="nounder4" id="notej--79" href="1.html#notejfn23-r">23</a></sup>
    </div>

    <div class="indent2" id="notej--80">
      Ernst Dronke, a young man only recently recruited to the League, who had accompanied Marx and Engels from Paris
      through Mainz to Cologne, went out on an organizational tour of some extent, sending back important reports to
      Marx in Cologne. Dronke covered Coblenz, Frankfurt, Mainz, and other cities. His reports on the immediate outlook
      for building workers’ associations or recruiting to the League came to Marx well into May, that is, close to the
      launching of the <em id="notej--81" class="calibre19">Neue Rheinische Zeitung</em> on June 1. These reports were quite pessimistic,
      and may have been instrumental in discouraging further efforts in this direction on the nationwide scale that
      Marx had originally envisaged.<sup id="notej--82" class="calibre20"><a id="notejfn24" class="calibre4"></a><a class="nounder4" id="notej--84" href="1.html#notejfn24-r">24</a></sup> The Mainz Appeal had attracted a very limited response. Besides, the <a id="page_665" class="calibre4"></a>publication of the <em id="notej--86" class="calibre19">N.R.Z.</em> immediately threw the whole Cologne cadre around
      Marx into strenuous day-to-day work.
    </div>

    <div class="indent2" id="notej--87">
      The big picture is this: throughout the country the rush of revolutionary events, breaking over a politically
      inexperienced and untrained working class, overwhelmed the fragile new cadres of the Communist League. In 1884
      Engels retrospectively put it this way: “The few hundred separate League members vanished in the enormous mass
      that had been suddenly hurled into the movement. Thus, the German proletariat at first appeared on the political
      stage as the extreme Democratic party.”<sup id="notej--88" class="calibre20"><a id="notejfn25" class="calibre4"></a><a class="nounder4" id="notej--90" href="1.html#notejfn25-r">25</a></sup> It was unable to take the stage as an independent proletarian
      movement, though Marx had tried to take this course. This was quite to be expected from the hindsight of 1884;
      but Marx, himself “suddenly hurled into the movement” like everyone else, had to spend at least April and May of
      1848 finding it out for himself. Emigré organizers could not improvise an independent proletarian movement simply
      by appearing on the scene, when the makings for it did not yet exist. A whole course of revolutionary experience
      had to be gone through by the working class, and this education is what 1848 provided.
    </div>

    <div class="indent2" id="notej--91">
      Marx had to readapt himself to this reality by the middle of May. The sequence of events makes clear that this
      was not caused by an orientation toward working in the Democratic Association; the relation was vice-versa: he
      had to reorient himself in this practical direction because he had ascertained the immediate infeasibility of
      building a workers’ association movement on a national scale.<a id="notejen4-r" class="calibre4"></a><a class="nounder4" id="notej--93" href="1.html#notejen4">*</a>
    </div>

    <div class="indent2" id="notej--94">
      For the next several months, therefore, the work of the Marx group focused on Cologne, where—as we have
      explained<sup id="notej--95" class="calibre20"><a id="notejfn26" class="calibre4"></a><a class="nounder4" id="notej--97" href="1.html#notejfn26-r">26</a></sup>—they followed a division of labor in building a workers’ association and a
      sympathetic Democratic Association side by side, in close alliance for some time. Here Marx put the Communist
      League form of organization on the shelf in favor of the open, broad workers’ association component in this
      strategy (to be discussed in Volume 3). In the last months of the revolution, in 1849, Marx gave up working in
      the Democratic Association and counterposed the perspective of building a national workers’ association. In doing
      this, he was not adopting this perspective for the first time but merely returning it to the <em id="notej--98" class="calibre19">top</em> of the agenda.
