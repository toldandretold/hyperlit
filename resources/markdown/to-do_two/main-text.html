So</u>, if readers prefer an older, more original form of the document (as opposed to one that the author has edited), <a href="/to-do_two#hypercite_b8kghyz_b"><u id="hypercite_b8kghyz">then they can</u></a> continue to load <a href="/to-do_two#hypercite_r4hu5da_b"><u id="hypercite_r4hu5da">that version</u></a>, and comment on it.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>With the most up-to-date html loaded into the browser, each letter is also inserted, row by row in a new column, with the latest time stamp. This is compared to the last time that the text had been saved in this position in the @book_id table.</li>
</ol>
<p>If the two columns align perfectly, then the old data column is deleted. For it is a <a href="/to-do_two#hypercite_8io4ibg_b"><u id="hypercite_8io4ibg">complete replica</u></a>.</p>
<p>If there are differences,then these need to be compared.</p>
<p>Working from the start of each column, values are compared, so that all the discontinuities <a href="/to-do_two#hypercite_vfoce3p_b"><u id="hypercite_vfoce3p">are discovered</u></a>.</p>
<p>Once each <a href="/to-do_two#hypercite_bc0zzji_b"><u id="hypercite_bc0zzji">discontinuity</u></a> start point is discovered, the parser notes the value of the character in that position in the oldest version.</p>
<p>Then, it parses through the newest column until it finds <a href="/to-do_two#hypercite_3ei6iei_b"><u id="hypercite_3ei6iei">the same value</u></a>. Then, it compares the next row of data from the older column, with the next row of data from the newer column. If they match, repeat. If a discontinuity arises, the character in the older column is noted. The newer column is passed until that same value appears. Then, when it does, its position is noted.</p>
<p>With this data, we <a href="/to-do_two#hypercite_qbvxf4h_b" id="hypercite_qbvxf4h_b"><u id="hypercite_qbvxf4h">can work out when</u></a> the newest file had characters either added, or delted. If characters were added, then they are inserted, at the discontinuity point, and time_stamped. This automatically shifts the values of the global_position for each character that follows the added characters. If the rows of data have been deleted, by the author, they are not removed, but the deleted characters do receive deleted_time_stamp in the authors column, and a forced null for global position, which means the next, non-deleted characters are revalued accordingly. Its just like deleteing rows of data from excel, but instead of htem being deleted, they are effectively being cut out and pasted to the bottom of the page, because table is sorted by global_position with 'null' values put to the bottom, uncounted.</p>
</blockquote><p>This effectively solves the problem of how to update the highlights. The data table for each @book_id has columns for each user. These start at null. However, if a user highlights text, then the global_position of the first character is marked.&nbsp;<span>'If'</span><a href="http://localhost:8000/to-do_two#hypercite_lxobkhw" id="hypercite_lxobkhw_b">[:]</a></p><p>In fact, the CSS should have some kind of forumula, whereby a given HL score for each character gives it a given css highlight intensity, and these should fade, in a given pattern, form character to character.</p><p>Thus, the page will be covered in a hyperlight heat map.

How far this is from the previous discontinuity is an expression of how many characters have either been deleted from one, or added to the other, in any possible combination of these two possibilities. 
&gt;
&gt;with the reconvergence noted, the parser continues down each column, until a new discontinuity is found. The process repeats down through till the end of both columns.
&gt;
&gt;At the end of the process, we have gathered some data. This includes: the total length of each column, and the difference. 
&gt;Is one +6 or -6 from the other?
&gt;
&gt;This total difference figure must be compared to the summation of all the different discontinutity to reconvergence gaps. 
&gt;
&gt;If the figures are identical, then <a href="/to-do_two#hypercite_gua8v9p_b"><u id="hypercite_gua8v9p">w</u></a>e know that the column that is +6 has either had 6 added, or the colum that is -6 has had 6 removed.

If the older file is negative, then <a href="/to-do_two#hypercite_165lv5y_b"><u id="hypercite_165lv5y">we</u></a> know they were added.
Therefore, we can conclude that <a href="/to-do_two#hypercite_reoduvx_b"><u id="hypercite_reoduvx">all</u></a> data gaps were positive for the positive column.
&gt;
    &gt;However, if the total difference and the sum of all data gaps is not the same, then it means that the most recent version has had both text deleted and text added, at various points. 
    &gt; We know, however, that the other file, the older one, has not been changed. 
    &gt;Thus, we can know

<li>This character position and count is compared to the one from the last time the page was saved.</li>

<p>Most important, though, is the column for the positions of all characters the last time this was c</p>
<p>If some have been deleted from column*(b) from the row 5-10, then column*(a) will have 5 rows with different characters until it logs, in row a11, <u id="hypercite_cqz753f">the same value as row b6</u>.

<p>What's the significance of this?</p>

<li>When a person highlights text, the computer detects the character position of each selected character, and checks a <u id="hypercite_8jwc5fm">highlighted yes/no boolean data column, changing from no to yes for those characters.</u></li>
<li>then, a javascript function/method is called, which a. inserts and tags both before the first character count form the selected text, and <a href="/to-do_two#hypercite_qil0o9z_z"><u id="hypercite_qil0o9z">immediately after the last one</u></a>.</li>

They can select from "most recent", "most upvoted", and "most read", for example. This will be calculated, eventually, also by the highlights and citations data table. Which will correspond with javascript, I think, for removing and displaying the relevant hyperlights and hypercites.</h1><p>However, if user presses a highlight, for example, all highlights that overlap with that will also be opened, in a single html page, for example.</p><p>Also, if multiple sources have cited the same hypercite, then when it is pressed, these will appear, also in the same html page, showing them as different citations. That is, author, title and date. If these are pressed, user is taken into the exact location of the quote. If the [:] is pressed, user is taken back to all the hypercites. Back again, and to the original location in the main-text.</p><p>In this way, users will move freely between each hyperlit source, whether from the <mark class="user-name_1729848642769" id="user-name_1729848642769">quoted</mark> text to the primary source, or from the primary source to all those <u id="hypercite_z7gk6qq">which </u>have hypercited it.</p><h2>Repeating for reading and editing hyperlights Once this is set up, a similar thing will need to be established for the hyperlights.md</h2><h1>syncing to a local folder?</h1><p>Ideally, all markdown files can be synced, via alliases, to a folder that syncs to a users account. This can, in theory, be synced to -- for example -- Obsidian.</p><p>Thus, users could have <u id="hypercite_wpqr7dz">a completely</u> socially interractive hypercite and hyperlight experience, and be able to connect with it via both browser, phone app, and obsidian.</p><p></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>
