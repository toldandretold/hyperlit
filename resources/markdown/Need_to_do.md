In this talk I will survey some of the key counterfactuals — or imaginary “what if?” scenarios — that were foundational to the campaign for a New International Economic Order. I consider how several of the project’s intellectual leaders answered the question: 

“What would happen if NIEO-style reforms were successfully implemented?”<a href="http://localhost:8000/pages/page-22a821ac-9fb7-4ede-ab31-093b29106c42.html" id="page-22a821ac-9fb7-4ede-ab31-093b29106c42"><sup>H</sup></a> 


# Why? #

For some, counterfactuals should be ignored. As imaginary scenarios, it is claimed that they have no place in historical research. 

This misses that imaginary “what if?” Scenarios are foundational to decision making.<a href="http://localhost:8000/pages/page-374eb552-cf90-4a14-b2d5-4b9956586a7e.html" id="page-374eb552-cf90-4a14-b2d5-4b9956586a7e"><sup>H</sup></a> 

When deciding to come to this panel, we had to imagine the alternatives, the  possible futures where we instead learned about other interesting topics, or where we simply sat outside, free from social anxiety. 

It is in this sense that imaginary “what if?” scenarios are of fundamental significance. 
Without them consciousness can’t choose its own history. 

This has been shown most effectively, in my view, in CLR James’ *Black Jacobins*. In this book, James considered not just the decisions that were made, but those options that were deeply considered but ultimately decided against. It is only by doing so that historians can truly understand the decision making, and therefore power, of a political project. 

The same is true for the uncertain global crisis of the 1970s. When deciding to create the campaign for a NIEO, G77 elites imagined what would happen if they did, and what would happen if they didn’t.

Today, I will not consider this in its full, impossible detail. I will not, that is, consider the decision making of each G77 elite, within each changing moment of the campaign. 

My focus is more broad brush. I assess the counterfactuals used by the NIEO’s most foundational political economists. These were Kwame Nkrumah and Raul Prebisch.

Before doing so, however, I begin with Samir Amin. Amin was not a proponent of the NIEO. He was a radical critic. 

# Samir Amin #
# *After the NIEO* (1982) #

Whereas the NIEO’s supporters described the G77 as a “trade union of the poor”, Amin described it in terms of its ruling classes. 

For him, this “non-aligned common front” was a movement of peripheral states and their bourgeoisies in opposition to the imperialists and global monopolies. 

He understood it, correctly, as a pro capitalist movement, and his criticisms were based on an understanding of its internal contradictions. 

These included: 

>- “sub-imperialism” between the more powerful G77 member states and the weaker members
>- and differences between ruling elites of the NIEO and the “popular masses”.

He wrote that “Each passing day carries with it more evidence that this strategy has the effect of turning the Third World into a fair game for the rival superpowers.” 

This has devastating implications for those movements — like the Progressive International — that are presently seeking to revive the NAM and renovate the NIEO. 
For if Amin is correct, the NIEO was not just a weak strategy, but a dangerous one.

Still, Amin did imagine a hypothetical future where a NIEO was successful in abolishing economic dependency. He  argued that: 

“If that should turn out to be the case one should be able to look back on imperialism as merely a stage - an intermediate stage - in the expansion of capitalism on a world scale and not as the highest stage of capitalism; it would have proved, that is, as the stage that ushered in the transition from a system characterised by the asymetrical centre-periphery relationships that define it to a homogeneous global system dominated by capitalist relations." pp. 441-442.

In other words, if the NIEO succeeded, or if it again succeeds, then it would disprove both Lenin and Amin. 

Instead of looking to such political projects, of solidarity amongst state and capitalist elites, Amin looked towards the masses, and predicted an upsurge like that which had made the original anti colonial movements successful. 



# Kwame Nkrumah #

A very different Leninist imaginary can be found in Kwame Nkrumah’s classic work, *Neocolonialism: The Last Stage of Imperialism*.

While sharing Amin's Leninist understanding of imperialism as monopoly capitalism, Nkrumah did not oppose working with monopolies. He argued that 'it is impossible for any of us to avoid dealing with monopoly in some form or another.' 

The more important question for Nkrumah was how. Here, he prescribed international solidarity, whereby Non-Aligned state elites could "maintain the integrity of our financial institutions" and "leave ourselves room to manoeuvre away" from neo-colonialism. 

In this respect, his focus was on pan-Africanism, but he also supported "a strengthening of the Afro-Asian Solidarity Organisation and the spirit of Bandung", as well as solidarity "on an increasingly formal basis" with “our Latin American brothers." (pp. 253-254)

With increased international solidarity, Nkrumah imagined global reforms that would become key pillars of the campaign for a New International Economic Order. These included:

>- calls for aid to be distributed by multilateral organisations operating democratically
>- a 'continental code to govern foreign investment'
>- and support for increased free trade.

Nkrumah didn't believe these reforms would succeed in isolation, but thought they would be useful. By mitigating the worst effects of imperialism, they would boost economic development in the periphery while heightening the contradiction between capital and labour in the imperial core. 

This was pure Lenin. For Lenin had argued that monopolistic superprofits allowed imperialists to "bribe the labour leaders and the upper stratum of the labour aristocracy." Nkrumah built on this directly, reasoning that any mitigation of such superprofits would heighten class conflict in the core. 

Thus he imagined that: 

>"When Africa becomes economically free and politically united, the monopolists will come face to face with their own working class in their own countries, and a new struggle will arise within which the liquidation and collapse of imperialism will be complete." pp. 255-256.

This is a wildly different Leninism to Samir Amin. For Amin, NIEO-style reform was a dangerous distraction. In Nkrumah's imaginary, NIEO-style reforms were strategically useful. They would assist with economic development in the periphery while heightening class contradictions in the imperial core. Thus, even if Nkrumah’s proposals often supported free trade, they were imagined as helping to transcend global capitalism.

# Raúl Prebisch #

However, the founding declarations of the NIEO were steeped in a very different political economy. These reflected the work of Raúl Prebisch, particularly his work as the founding Secretary General of the United Nations Conference on Trade And Development (UNCTAD). For Prebisch, NIEO-style reforms would not undermine the interests of the core, or the so-called advanced industrial powers. 

Yes, Prebisch advocated for net transfers of wealth from the core to the periphery, and for a general system of preferences to promote peripheral exports. However, these were promoted as temporary measures. Once the “declining terms of trade” had been surpassed, free trade would be able to benefit all economies as it was already supposed to. 

Thus, Prebisch wrote that:

>"With an effort of the imagination it is possible to visualize a situation of dynamic equilibrium in the distant future in which the trend in question disappears as a result of the world-wide process of industrialization." pp. 15-16

Still, Prebisch never imagined that NIEO-style reforms would change things over night, nor on their own. He used a counterfactual to imagine that:

>"If the peripheral countries manage to secure a larger share for their primary exports in the consumption of the industrial countries, this, together with the transfer of income from the latter countries to the former to offset the effects of the deterioration in the terms of trade, will help to narrow the trade gap but will not in itself be enough to close it. These measures will be palliatives, and the relief they afford, though considerable in some cases, will be of limited scope owing to the size of the gap. Hence, the absolute necessity of building up trade in industrial exports." p. 20.

# The Strategic Synthesis #

For Nkrumah, NIEO-style reforms would be damaging to the interests of the imperial core. As such, they could only be won through collective, non-aligned independence.

For Prebisch (in 1964), NIEO style reforms would benefit both core and periphery, so it was possible to win them on the basis of consensus agreement between North and South. 

These two distinct imaginaries about what NIEO-style reforms would achieve implied two distinct strategies, or options. 

The brilliance of the NIEO, as a political project, was how it relied on a synthesis of both. 

Via the Non-Aligned Movement, which Nkrumah had helped found, OPEC's new petro-dollar surpluses were used to force negotiations on all matters of economic development. The result was the Sixth Special Session, called for by the then-leader of the NAM, and OPEC member, Algeria.

This was the Nkrumahist strategic imaginary in action. Through collective independence, the G77 leveraged the world economic crisis. However, they used this power to kickstart a renewed attempt at negotiations which aimed at achieving a global consensus. 

This is why the founding declarations were taken to the UN General Assembly, where each member state had an equal vote. 

Thus, by looking at the counterfactuals used by Nkrumah and Prebisch, we can see two broad strategic imaginaries, each of which help explain the decision making which created the original campaign.  

This is important for explaining how the NIEO had been possible. Its theoretical pluralism, rather than being a weakness, was a strength. 

It is also important for understanding the present and future. For right now, as the Progressive International attempts to "renovate the NIEO", its declarations reveal the bourgeoning of a new synthesis. Despite incorporating issues that were sidelined in the 1970s, the PI's statements reflect the afterlives of the strategic imaginaries I have outlined today, including those of Samir Amin. 

However, I don't think I have time here to get into that.
