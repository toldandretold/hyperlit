<h1><strong>Reevaluating Marcel Gauchet’s Œuvre: Barriers, Contributions and the Need for Broader Engagement</strong></h1>
<h2>Abstract:</h2>
<p>Marcel Gauchet has significantly influenced French political philosophy and more widely public debates in France. Nonetheless, his work remains largely unrecognized outside of Francophone academia. Gauchet’s work provides profound insights into modern liberal democracy, political autonomy and the historical foundations of contemporary socio-political phenomena. This article argues that Anglophone academia must re-evaluate and disseminate Gauchet’s work more broadly, as his theory of modernity offers valuable insights into the socio-political dimension of the human condition and the current crises facing democratic cultures. The limited engagement with Gauchet’s work in Anglophone academic circles can be traced to several factors. Firstly, Gauchet’s marginalization is due to minimal efforts to translate the large body of his work, with those few translations often being misinterpreted. Secondly, the systemic promotion and dominance of post-structuralism in Anglophone academia sidelined Gauchet’s elucidations on autonomy, democratization and the crises of democratic culture. Foucault’s interdisciplinary influence overshadowed Gauchet’s contributions as well as those of others that held a more anti-structuralist positioning such as Claude Lefort and Cornelius Castoriadis. Gauchet’s critique of Foucault and break with Lefort further intensified the marginalization of his work within an Anglophone academic environment deeply entrenched in Foucauldian and Lefortian discourse.</p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Gauchet stands as one of France’s most esteemed contemporary thinkers. He was not only one of the founders of one of France’s pivotal journals, <em>Le Débat</em>, which he co-edited with Pierre Nora from 1980 to 2021 but he was also an editor at Gallimard for several decades. Alongside his editorial duties, Gauchet taught at the <em>École des hautes études</em> <em>en sciences sociales</em> and now holds the title of Professor Emeritus at the <em>Centre de</em> <em>recherches politiques Raymond Aron</em>. While Gauchet remains an important intellectual figure in France, the Anglophone academic world has not embraced his work.<sup id="fnref1:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref">1</a></sup> Even though French philosophy has drawn attention in English-speaking academia for decades now, Gauchet’s work has not seen the same level of engagement as other French intellectuals from the 1960s, such as Michel Foucault and Jacques Derrida, or as some of his peers, like Alain Badiou, Jean-Luc Nancy and Jacques Rancière.</p>
<p>Gauchet’s slow reception can be linked to the strong sway that 1960s French philosophy had on academic institutions, which, in part, can be seen as the outcome of Cold War cultural politics promoting French post-structuralists—notably Foucault—to counter the influence of Marxist and post-Marxist thought in American universities. The rise and prominence of identity politics and growing academic focus on gender and sexual identity—driven by a broader project of equality, autonomy, democratization in Western discourse and institutions—further entrenched the dominance of post-structuralist paradigms, which inadvertently marginalized alternative perspectives like Gauchet’s that critiqued Marxism and post-structuralism from a post-Marxist standpoint. This shift of emphasis brought a new form of legitimacy predicated on individualism and personal identity. For Gauchet, prioritizing individual rights and self-defined identities not only challenges traditional social structures and institutions, it also leads to depoliticization, which is at the core of a contemporary democratic crisis that emerged from the radicalization of the pursuit of autonomy. “L'autonomie était considérée comme la solution; elle se révèle être le problème.”<sup id="fnref1:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref">2</a></sup> Despite their ethnic, religious, sexual, or professional identities, individuals are rejecting objective assignments in favour of a self-chosen uniqueness they wish the community to recognize.<sup id="fnref1:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref">3</a></sup> When a society is largely comprised of individuals pursuing their own interests it becomes difficult for people to recognize that society is a unified group characterised by collective projects, making effective democratic governance hard to achieve.<sup id="fnref1:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref">4</a></sup></p>
<p>Due to the personal and intellectual break with his former teacher Claude Lefort, who had an established following in North America, Gauchet was misrepresented as a conservative thinker even though he has always said that extending equality to categories of people hitherto excluded from it was a natural extension of the value of ontological equality in which democracy is grounded.<sup id="fnref1:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref">5</a></sup> Furthermore, early in his career, Gauchet, in <em>La Pratique de l’esprit humain</em>,<sup id="fnref1:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref">6</a></sup> co-authored with Gladys Swain, critiqued Foucault’s interpretations of the history of madness. This critique positioned Gauchet against the prevailing Foucauldian perspectives, which had already gained substantial acceptance within English-speaking academia. Foucault’s interdisciplinary influence meant that any counter-narrative or criticism, especially one as foundational as Gauchet’s, was bound to face scrutiny and potentially slow dissemination. As noted by François Cusset, the 1980s brought about a radical change in academic discourse and the advent of what he calls “French Theory” which gained a very strong following in North America.<sup id="fnref1:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref">7</a></sup> Gauchet’s work, however, did not align with this dominant school of thought.<sup id="fnref1:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref">8</a></sup></p>
<h2>Gauchet contra Foucault</h2>
<p>After having collaborated throughout the 1970s with Cornelius Castoriadis and Claude Lefort who had founded the socialist-libertarian group <em>Socialisme ou Barbarie</em> critical of Soviet Communism,<sup id="fnref1:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref">9</a></sup> Gauchet departed from the editorial committee of the journal <em>Libre</em> due to increasing intellectual divergence with Lefort.<sup id="fnref1:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref">10</a></sup> Gauchet started collaborating with a group of historians, namely François Furet, Pierre Nora and Krzysztof Pomian, who were also critical of Marxism’s dominance in post-WWII France. By involving Gauchet in the foundation of <em>Le Débat</em> in 1980 and through his support of his academic position at the EHESS, Nora was trying to counter Foucault’s influence on French intellectual culture because of his belief that Foucault took liberties with historical facts, which is precisely what Gauchet and Swain argued in <em>La Pratique de l’esprit humain</em>.<sup id="fnref1:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref">11</a></sup> Gauchet and Foucault’s intellectual antagonism, rooted in their diverging hermeneutics of modernity and the role of institutions—i.e., Foucault sees the state as always only oppressive while for Gauchet the state is both oppressive and creative—extends beyond their critiques of psychiatry and the treatment of madness.</p>
<p>Gauchet stands in critical opposition to Foucault’s negative portrayal of modern power through his argument that modernity embraces a project of autonomy, reflecting broader contrasts in their personal and intellectual approaches. Beyond the theoretical chasm between them, their differences were also embodied in, and exacerbated by, their interactions within the French intellectual scene—e.g., their relationships with figures like Nora who held them both in high esteem as the two most significant intellectual figures of the time. Nora saw Gauchet as Foucault’s antithesis.<sup id="fnref1:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref">12</a></sup> Foucault was brilliant, flamboyant and provocative, while Gauchet embodied a methodical and grounded approach that captured the respect of the intellectual community. Their divergent styles indicated a deep philosophical divide, further complicated by their differing backgrounds and temperaments, which influenced their positions and rivalries within France’s intellectual landscape.</p>
<p>Gauchet, in collaboration with Swain, promoted a conception of modern power that clashed with Foucault’s interpretation of modernity and his understanding of madness and its treatment.<sup id="fnref1:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote-ref">13</a></sup> Building on Swain’s earlier thesis in medical science,<sup id="fnref1:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote-ref">14</a></sup> they critiqued the conclusions made by Foucault in <em>Folie et déraison: Histoire de la folie à l’âge classique</em> (1961) and <em>Surveiller et punir: Naissance de la prison</em> (1975) by uncovering factual inaccuracies in Foucault’s references and refuting the theoretical implications of his historical interpretations. Their critique was centred around Foucault’s thesis that the “great confinement” of the mid-seventeenth century marked a shift in the treatment of the mentally insane, who were previously allowed to live freely but were then forcibly removed from society. Foucault asserted that the “great confinement” was evidence that, despite their professed humanism, modern societies engaged in exclusionary practices. For Foucault, the mentally insane were confined due to a radical shift that was brought forth by a modernity that redefined human identity based on reason and rationality. The mad were excluded from rational society because madness was seen as the opposite of rationality. Gauchet and Swain, however, advocated a radically different interpretation of madness and its position in pre-modern societies: madness and the mad in pre-modern societies were perceived as radically Other—either as superhuman or subhuman. They contended that the mentally insane roamed freely because they reinforced, rather than challenged, the <em>status quo</em> serving as a “foil” to legitimize it.<sup id="fnref1:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote-ref">15</a></sup> Their thesis diametrically opposed Foucault’s conclusions that the “great confinement” was a consequence of the new rational identity that defined the modern state.</p>
<p>According to Foucault, modernity brought with it another radical transformation: a new form of punitive treatment where the mad were likened to wild beasts needing restraint. This era of “great confinement”, its creation of asylums, signified modern society’s increasing power and propensity to exclude individuals deviating from social norms. Foucault viewed the asylum as an apparatus of modern disciplinary power through which the insane internalized their moral inferiority. Antithetically, for Gauchet and Swain, paradoxically, this exclusion indicated a new form of inclusion, one driven by the Enlightenment’s first attack on hierarchy and emphasis on ontological equality. This novel form of inclusion led to the end of confinement post-French Revolution and the establishment of asylums with the goal of curing the insane. In contrast to Foucault’s view that Philippe Pinel’s methods were exclusionary, Gauchet and Swain credited Pinel with introducing a more humane and scientific treatment that marked a “qualitative break” with previous eras and a “new phase in the ongoing inclusion of otherness within civilization”.<sup id="fnref1:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote-ref">16</a></sup> Pinel, according to Gauchet and Swain, recognized that the mentally insane had the capacity for subjective experience and aimed to reintegrate them into society through moral treatment.<sup id="fnref1:17"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote-ref">17</a></sup> Gauchet and Swain conceded that the democratic ideals underpinning modern asylums had both utopian and totalitarian implications that were never fully realized. This failure highlighted the limits of scientific and rational control over madness, contrasting with Foucault’s portrayal of asylums as successful political laboratories of control.<sup id="fnref1:18"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote-ref">18</a></sup></p>
<p>The differing historical analyses of psychiatry’s role put forth by Foucault and Gauchet and Swain underscore divergent views on the nature of modern power and social change. While Foucault’s critique identified localized resistance to modern disciplinary power, Gauchet and Swain emphasized an underlying project of democratization and autonomy that shaped and continues to shape modern society. For Gauchet and Swain, the evolution of psychiatry was part of the historical project underlying modern democratic culture, which shifted the ways societies are structured and the way individuals understand their positions within these structures. For them, the democratising project moves towards equality by shifting from an ontological hierarchy of vertical alterity to a horizontal model of collective self-determination. Antithetically, Foucault still saw an inherent horizontal hierarchical structure in society and perceived social structures and institutions as sources of domination instead of liberation. Gauchet and Swain took a more positive view of the roles of institutions and structures and maintained that modern power is inherently ambiguous because it simultaneously creates both autonomous subjects and a culture of pseudo-omnipotence.</p>
<p>Gauchet’s theory of modernity, characterized by a novel understanding of self- and collective-identity devoid of reference to an absolute Other, radically challenged Foucault’s understanding of society’s propensity to advance institutions that promoted a type of governmentality based on disciplinary and totalitarian control. Gauchet’s narrative of modernity along the line of a political anthropology, explored through what he called “exit from religion”—the departure from the vertical, hierarchical form of social organisation he called “religion” with its emphasis on the authority of tradition and its imperial conception of power—rather than a mere secularisation, argued that modernity profoundly transformed human relationships, alongside with the conception of time, nature, social organisation and individual identity. For Gauchet, “religion” constitutes an historical mechanism that plays a constitutive role in shaping and organizing human communities.<sup id="fnref1:19"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote-ref">19</a></sup> Going beyond religion as a subjective experience of faith or spirituality, Gauchet underscores the political dimension of religion and its function of providing shared beliefs, values and practices establishing solidarity, social cohesion and identity within a community.</p>
<p>Religion, endowed by the legitimacy of its authority, creates a framework within which people come together, understand their place in the world—both socially and existentially—and establish norms and institutions governing collective life. For Gauchet, religion’s centrality in forming social institutions, directing social action and contributing to the continuity and stability of communities over time is indicative of its political dimension. Influenced by Hegelian thought but distinct in his rejection of teleological determinism, Gauchet posited that modernity affords humanity the power to transform their world through science and technology “but this power does not lead to a form of self-reconciliation and the abolition of difference in a homogeneous rational society”.<sup id="fnref1:20"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote-ref">20</a></sup> Instead, his understanding of modernity recognises the limits of rational autonomy and the impossibility of a fully homogenous, self-mastering society, emphasising the pluralistic and essentially divided nature of modern democratic societies.</p>
<h2>Gauchet’s Political Anthropological Approach to Religion</h2>
<p>Gauchet’s <em>oeuvre</em> “epitomises a specifically French approach to social phenomena which considers their political significance to be paramount”.<sup id="fnref1:21"><a href="#fn:21" class="footnote-ref">21</a></sup> With roots in French sociology, tracing back to the contributions of Émile Durkheim and Marcel Mauss, and French structural anthropology, originating from Claude Lévi-Strauss and Louis Dumont, Gauchet seeks to comprehend the human political condition.<sup id="fnref1:22"><a href="#fn:22" class="footnote-ref">22</a></sup> French intellectual traditions have looked towards anthropology for insights on human behaviour, which contrasts with the Anglo-American liberal tradition that turned to the economic sciences.<sup id="fnref1:23"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote-ref">23</a></sup> Several factors distinct to French cultural history fostered this inclination towards anthropology, especially the challenge of deciphering religious experiences after / in the wake of the French Revolution.<sup id="fnref1:24"><a href="#fn:24" class="footnote-ref">24</a></sup> This anthropological approach to understanding socio-political phenomena has deeply influenced French political philosophy and the humanities more broadly, shaping its engagement with religion and understanding that it is an institution with sociological and political significance. The scientific study of religion, as exemplified by Durkheim and Mauss’s work, can be traced back to August Comte, Saint-Simon and Joseph de Maistre in the 1800s.<sup id="fnref1:25"><a href="#fn:25" class="footnote-ref">25</a></sup> From that period onward, whenever French political philosophy has engaged with religion, it has adopted the French anthropological approach,<sup id="fnref1:26"><a href="#fn:26" class="footnote-ref">26</a></sup> which examines the profound impact of religious beliefs, practices and institutions on the evolution of societies, cultures and historical narratives. It contrasts with the German sociological tradition, heavily influenced by Protestantism, and which, as exemplified by Max Weber, highlights the ways religious doctrines guide individual action and lead to social outcomes.</p>
<p>While younger, Gauchet was inspired by the work of Lévi-Strauss.<sup id="fnref1:27"><a href="#fn:27" class="footnote-ref">27</a></sup> Although Gauchet was captivated by French structural anthropology’s focus <mark class="user-name_1731138411840" id="user-name_1731138411840" style="cursor: pointer;">of</mark> on “the symbolic structures in social life”, he soon rejected Lévi-Strauss’s “emphasis on mental structures”—as it sidelines the role of history and individual agency—to engage with the work of Durkheim and its original understanding of social structures.<sup id="fnref1:28"><a href="#fn:28" class="footnote-ref">28</a></sup> It was, however, through ethnology that he made sense of the phenomenon. In spite of his disagreements with certain tenets of structural anthropology, Gauchet maintained his fascination for ethnology and the “mythology of so-called primitive societies”. <sup id="fnref1:29"><a href="#fn:29" class="footnote-ref">29</a></sup> This interest led him to an understanding that pre-modern societies frame their identity through a “dette du sens”<sup id="fnref1:30"><a href="#fn:30" class="footnote-ref">30</a></sup>—a notion linked to Pierre Clastres<sup id="fnref1:31"><a href="#fn:31" class="footnote-ref">31</a></sup>—which possesses both metaphysical and traditional aspects linked to ancestral roots.<sup id="fnref1:32"><a href="#fn:32" class="footnote-ref">32</a></sup> By highlighting the distinctiveness of stateless societies and their resistance to centralized power, Clastres’s political anthropology underscored their distinct relationship with history. Stateless societies resisted historical progression to preserve their egalitarian structures and, by doing so, maintained a deliberate stasis. Drawing on Clastres, Gauchet further developed an understanding of how societies interpret and interact with their historicity.</p>
<p><u id="hypercite_gf15d7x"><mark class="user-name_1731138633122" id="user-name_1731138633122" style="cursor: pointer;">For Gauchet, historicity, or historical consciousness</mark></u>—even if obscured by myth or religious belief, <mark class="user-name_1731138680677" id="user-name_1731138680677" style="cursor: pointer;">as in stateless societies</mark>—holds the key to deciphering the political core of communities. The past continually influences present power dynamics and the development of collective identity. By placing the political at the heart of historical consciousness, Gauchet redefines our understanding of social evolution and highlights the inextricable link between the state, historicity and the ongoing project of collective self-realization. The “dette du sens” signifies a transmission of knowledge—both sacred and political—from one generation to the next and represents a fundamental obligation owed by societies to a transcendent, or divine principle, explaining their origins and shaping their identity and solidarity. In primitive societies, this debt—paid to gods, nature or ancestors—is seen as the source of all social order and meaning. Conversely, the state emerges when this debt is redirected towards priests or kings—earthly representatives of the divine—who mediate between the sacred and the profane. Hence, the “dette du sens” is linked to a society’s socio-political institution because, firstly, it legitimizes authority and power, and secondly, it defines and rationalizes its place in the world. Thus, for Gauchet the formation of the state is connected to this debt as it transforms the way societies organize themselves. <mark class="user-name_1731138873952" id="user-name_1731138873952" style="cursor: pointer;">The new relationship to the divine inadvertently creates a hierarchical structure whereby certain groups or individuals are seen as closer to the sacred authority, leading to the development of social inequality and turning the state into an instrument of control and domination. </mark>Gauchet’s later work, however, elucidates the process of state formation and the accompanying debt as that which creates also the conditions for human autonomy. By accepting and mastering the debt—recognizing the state’s instituting role—individuals and societies can pursue projects of autonomy. <mark class="user-name_1731138999962" id="user-name_1731138999962" style="cursor: pointer;">This idea reflects Gauchet’s broader argument that autonomy does not come from rejecting the state but from understanding and transcending its role in human history.</mark></p>
<p>Gauchet perceives modernity as a collective endeavour aspiring to shape a completely novel societal framework—by the anthropological standards of human history—which he terms a “society of individuals”.<sup id="fnref1:33"><a href="#fn:33" class="footnote-ref">33</a></sup> Gauchet’s research offers a philosophical anthropology focusing on the modern political human experience as the key to understanding, in contrast, the previous forms assumed by human societies. Through his work, which emphasizes <em>the political side</em> of modernity, readers are invited to look beyond economic perspectives and appreciate the political underpinnings that shape socio-historical forms and how societies interpret and interact with their internal dynamics. A central tenet of Gauchet’s philosophy concerns the <em>symbolic</em> nature of institutions, which are not mere structures but are laden with shared meanings that are collectively embraced by members of a society. Institutions embody the deeper political dimensions of human societies and echo collective aspirations, conflicts and ideals. They shape social identities and mediate the internal differences and conflicts that arise within society. In contrast to Marx<sup id="fnref1:34"><a href="#fn:34" class="footnote-ref">34</a></sup> and some sociologists of the 19th century, for Gauchet, <mark class="user-name_1731139401744" id="user-name_1731139401744" style="cursor: pointer;">these institutions were not birthed spontaneously or natu</mark>rally.</p>
<p>Gauchet’s philosophical ambition is to develop a framework described as a “philosophy of history” or a “philosophical history of humanity”, by investigating the meaning and wellsprings of human history.<sup id="fnref1:35"><a href="#fn:35" class="footnote-ref">35</a></sup> This framework is not only a theory of democracy, it is “first and foremost a theory of political modernity”, which emerges through the exploration of its origins and development.<sup id="fnref1:36"><a href="#fn:36" class="footnote-ref">36</a></sup> His work analyses the fundamental structures of human history and seeks to understand the conditions that shaped modern political realities. Gauchet’s broader reflection thus aims to “unearth the fundamental structures of human history”, and by situating modern society within “a universal historical perspective”<sup id="fnref1:37"><a href="#fn:37" class="footnote-ref">37</a></sup> he offers “a transcendental analysis of the conditions of social existence”. <sup id="fnref1:38"><a href="#fn:38" class="footnote-ref">38</a></sup> In this respect, Gauchet remains faithful to the philosophical ambition of the great post-structuralist critics of modernity from the 1960s and 1970s, such as Foucault and Derrida. Gauchet is, however, at odds with them in his more positive estimation of modernity, though he is not blind to certain illusions modernity has about itself. Gauchet’s philosophy belongs to the genre of “Grand Theory”, which engages in a mode of philosophy that does not shy away from all-encompassing visions of history.<sup id="fnref1:39"><a href="#fn:39" class="footnote-ref">39</a></sup></p>
<h2>Cultural Politics, Marginalisation, the rift between Lefort and Gauchet</h2>
<p>Part of the reason for the systematic marginalisation of Gauchet’s work in the Anglophone academic world can be traced back to the complex interplay of Cold War cultural politics and intellectual rivalries within French philosophy. Gabriel Rockhill’s analysis, based on CIA archive material<sup id="fnref1:40"><a href="#fn:40" class="footnote-ref">40</a></sup> released in 2011, shows that the CIA’s cultural strategies during the Cold War aimed to counter not only Marxism but also all forms of political radicalism that significantly influenced the intellectual landscape of the time.<sup id="fnref1:41"><a href="#fn:41" class="footnote-ref">41</a></sup> According to Rockhill, the CIA’s covert cultural politics aimed at countering the influence of French left-wing radicalism by promoting authors like Lévi-Strauss and Foucault, who had repudiated Marxism. The reception of Gauchet’s work got caught up in the polemic against the influence of Marxism and the promotion of specific theorists, with post-structuralism as its counter. This promotion inadvertently also impacted a strand of socio-political theory that rejected post-structuralism from <mark class="user-name_1731139663420" id="user-name_1731139663420" style="cursor: pointer;">a post-Marxist perspective, and in particular the works of Castoriadis and Lefort that advanced left-wing critiques of Soviet communism and was interpreted as promoting a radical and anarchistic vision of democracy.</mark><sup id="fnref1:42"><a href="#fn:42" class="footnote-ref">42</a></sup></p>
<p>The American focus on a critique of totalitarianism, derived from Foucault’s work and articulated by the New Philosophers André Glucksmann and Bernard Henri-Lévy, effectively concealed the existence of alternative left-wing critiques of both Marxism and liberalism, which further contributed to the marginalisation of Gauchet’s work. When Gauchet’s work began gaining recognition in the early 1990s, key texts were partially translated and presented as part of a revival of liberal thought in French intellectual culture.<sup id="fnref1:43"><a href="#fn:43" class="footnote-ref">43</a></sup> However, these translations omitted references to his early ties to Marxism and the critiques by Castoriadis and Lefort, which likely led to an initial perception of his work as socially and politically conservative.<sup id="fnref1:44"><a href="#fn:44" class="footnote-ref">44</a></sup> In France, Gauchet’s critique of Foucault made him a target for those defending what they saw as true radicalism, thereby reinforcing a perception of his work as right-wing in an intellectual environment still structured around the left-right divide from the Marxist era.<sup id="fnref1:45"><a href="#fn:45" class="footnote-ref">45</a></sup> Gauchet’s distancing from the revolutionary spirit and <mark class="user-name_1731139802478" id="user-name_1731139802478" style="cursor: pointer;">his argument that revolutionary change was incompatible with the democratic ethos also contributed to this perception.</mark><sup id="fnref1:46"><a href="#fn:46" class="footnote-ref">46</a></sup> <u id="hypercite_ajf7w7c">The English-speaking academic world’s inability to disentangle left-wing thinking from the Cold War binary</u> mindset prevented a comprehensive critique of Marxism that could incorporate Gauchet’s insights.<sup id="fnref1:47"><a href="#fn:47" class="footnote-ref">47</a></sup></p>
<p>As seen above, in the course of the 1970s Gauchet distanced himself from Lefort and Castoriadis.<sup id="fnref1:48"><a href="#fn:48" class="footnote-ref">48</a></sup> For Gauchet, Castoriadis had failed to acknowledge that the revolutionary spirit belonged to an obsolete regime of historicity,<sup id="fnref1:49"><a href="#fn:49" class="footnote-ref">49</a></sup> evinced by the “significant changes in the meaning and use of rights language during the Revolution”.<sup id="fnref1:50"><a href="#fn:50" class="footnote-ref">50</a></sup> Yet they remained in good terms, Gauchet confessing to Castoriadis’s biographer, François Dosse, his intellectual debt to him.<sup id="fnref1:51"><a href="#fn:51" class="footnote-ref">51</a></sup> His distancing from Lefort, however, became deeply personal.<sup id="fnref1:52"><a href="#fn:52" class="footnote-ref">52</a></sup> Gauchet began his intellectual career being very close to Lefort’s intellectual and political leanings as a non-Marxist, libertarian leftist, however, his intellectual journey took him “from anarchism to liberalism to republicanism”.<sup id="fnref1:53"><a href="#fn:53" class="footnote-ref">53</a></sup> The rift between them was exacerbated because Lefort claimed that Gauchet stole his ideas when he wrote up the notes he had taken from Lefort’s lectures on the notion of symbolic institution and developed them by adding his own ideas. Gauchet distanced himself when he realized that Lefort was not going to give him any credit for his own contributions.<sup id="fnref1:54"><a href="#fn:54" class="footnote-ref">54</a></sup> According to Brian Singer, it is due to the Lefort-centric American discussions on democracy and Gauchet’s divergence from Lefort that his contributions have been sidelined.<sup id="fnref1:55"><a href="#fn:55" class="footnote-ref">55</a></sup> Gauchet’s intellectual trajectory and evolution away from radical democracy became the focal point of criticism from thinkers like Miguel Abensour who remained aligned and committed to Lefort’s revolutionary politics. This divergence was starkly highlighted in Abensour’s attack on Gauchet, where their shared intellectual roots as students of Lefort in Caen only served to underscore the depth of their ideological rift.<sup id="fnref1:56"><a href="#fn:56" class="footnote-ref">56</a></sup></p>
<p>Abensour accused Gauchet of adopting a “politique normale”, in which democracy is seen as static, and betraying the radical democratic ideals Lefort passed on to them. Abensour argued that Gauchet now embraced a rigid framework that fundamentally rejected subversive radicalism. Gauchet retorted: “La philosophie de la démocratie et l’imaginaire de la radicalité subversive font mauvais ménage, en dernier ressort.”<sup id="fnref1:57"><a href="#fn:57" class="footnote-ref">57</a></sup> Abensour claimed that Gauchet’s shift was not merely a personal political and intellectual transformation but a fundamental betrayal of Lefort’s concept of “démocratie sauvage”<sup id="fnref1:58"><a href="#fn:58" class="footnote-ref">58</a></sup> that defines democratic power as a “lieu vide”, which no single person or entity can claim to occupy on a permanent basis and illustrates how democracy thrives on conflict, continuously being reshaped through the struggles and participation of its citizens.<sup id="fnref1:59"><a href="#fn:59" class="footnote-ref">59</a></sup> For Gauchet, however, Lefort romanticized political disorder and marginal activities. <mark class="user-name_1731140315331" id="user-name_1731140315331">Gauchet dismissed the idea of “démocratie sauvage” as a form of “révoltisme” focussed excessively on rebellion and insurrection without a clear or constructive vision for effective governance</mark>.<sup id="fnref1:60"><a href="#fn:60" class="footnote-ref">60</a></sup> The glorification of democracy’s chaotic elements neglected the importance of established institutions and the rule of law essential for maintaining a functional democratic system. Democracy requires the stabilizing influence of formal institutions to ensure that its transformative potential is realized in a constructive manner.</p>
<h2>Conclusion: Gauchet’s Contribution to debates on European secularism and its limitations</h2>
<p>Although Gauchet’s work has not garnered the attention it merits, <em>Le Désenchantement du monde</em>, translated into English in 1997 and including a preface written by Charles Taylor, gained significant engagement and continues to actively inform current discussions on secularism, including the French discourse on <em>laïcité</em>, and what some argue should replace it: post-secularism.<sup id="fnref1:61"><a href="#fn:61" class="footnote-ref">61</a></sup> The English translation’s subtitle, <em>A Political History of Religion</em>, seems to have been overlooked. The book’s value, transcends the disciplinary boundaries of a sociology of religion and enters the realms of philosophical anthropology, political anthropology and political philosophy in ways that also engage with what some post-colonial scholars, such as Talal Asad, first saw as the impetus to formulate an anthropology of secularism.<sup id="fnref1:62"><a href="#fn:62" class="footnote-ref">62</a></sup> In this context, Asad mourns “the loss of certain kinds of habitus”—such as bodily and sensory experiences of the divine and the practice of faith through physical actions—as “faith” becomes an epistemological category and a means of acquiring knowledge.<sup id="fnref1:63"><a href="#fn:63" class="footnote-ref">63</a></sup></p>
<p>The post-secular discourse that emerged from Asad’s work challenges what is known as the secularization theory articulated in the work of Weber and Durkheim, which sees modernisation and the rise of scientific rationality as coterminous with the decline of religion.<sup id="fnref1:64"><a href="#fn:64" class="footnote-ref">64</a></sup> By deconstructing grand narratives and fixed binaries—e.g., religious and secular—post-structuralism created space for alternative understandings of religion’s role in society, acknowledging its persistence and transformation rather than its eradication. This intellectual movement paved the way for nuanced discussions about how religious and secular elements coexist and interact in modern contexts. The critique of the secularization theory was deepened, but outside the post-structuralist paradigm, by Shmuel Eisenstadt’s “multiple modernities” thesis that argues that modernization manifests differently across cultures.<sup id="fnref1:65"><a href="#fn:65" class="footnote-ref">65</a></sup> In accord with Eisenstadt, Taylor asserts that an <em>acultural</em> theory of modernity “locks us into an ethnocentric prison, condemned to project our own forms onto everyone else”.<sup id="fnref1:66"><a href="#fn:66" class="footnote-ref">66</a></sup> This Eurocentric perspective does not acknowledge the socio-historical creativity of diverse societies to carve out their unique paths. Gauchet’s anthropology of modernity aligns with the “multiple modernities” thesis in the way it acknowledges that democratization and the “exit from religion” is complex and historically contingent: there is thus no deterministic link between Christianity and European modernity’s discovery of the political form of the nation-state and its democratization.</p>
<p>For Gauchet, in every place and time it has flourished, humanity has always faced a fundamental problematic: to embrace its power to change the world, leading to a sense of contingency, or to sacrifice this consciousness for a sense of unity and belonging to a pre-given, extra-social and meaningful order. Humans, according to Gauchet, are characterized by the power of “negation”, which leads them to existential homelessness. The propensity to negate their power of creativity, productivity, and the responsibility that this carries with it, paradoxically through the creation and production of structures and institutions that alienate or “dispossess”, sets the stage for Gauchet’s analysis of disenchantment. He, however, refused to use the words secularization, laicization or even the very word disenchantment<sup id="fnref1:67"><a href="#fn:67" class="footnote-ref">67</a></sup>—even if he employed the latter term in his book’s title because of its poetic force and relative neutrality.<sup id="fnref1:68"><a href="#fn:68" class="footnote-ref">68</a></sup> The failure of these terms to get to the phenomenon’s core led Gauchet to propose the “exit from religion” as an alternative concept, which according to Paolo Costa is a solution to the simplistic narrative of change that the classical secularization thesis is defined by and emphasizes, thereby failing to capture the complexity of human history and the ongoing presence of religious structuration. Gauchet addresses this limitation by offering a more sophisticated account, reframing secularization as a process that produces radical novelty while maintaining the existing structure and addressing the underlying tensions between modern autonomy and ancient heteronomy.<sup id="fnref1:69"><a href="#fn:69" class="footnote-ref">69</a></sup></p>
<p>Gauchet attempts to “openly come to terms with the scientific legacy and methodological challenges of Weber’s approach”.<sup id="fnref1:70"><a href="#fn:70" class="footnote-ref">70</a></sup> His contribution is a “political history of religion” that examines how religion and politics are intertwined in shaping human societies. Politics, for Gauchet, is a condition of human sociality insofar as it mediates the necessary division that exists within societies. In tribal societies the political is displaced by religion, externalizing society’s institution to an inaccessible elsewhere. This radical dispossession prevents societies from entering history as agents of their own destiny. For Gauchet the rise of the <em>state</em> and the so-called Axial Age are critical junctures in the evolution of religion.<sup id="fnref1:71"><a href="#fn:71" class="footnote-ref">71</a></sup> While the emergence of monotheism—especially Judaism in its confrontation with Roman imperialism—represents a significant shift that asserts the presence of a transcendent God involved in history. Monotheism, as such, introduces an unprecedented metaphysical and ethical tension that opens up possibilities for personal questioning and inner dissent, laying the groundwork for developing individual autonomy.</p>
<p>For Gauchet, the process of modern disenchantment involves a gradual reappropriation of what was initially removed through dispossession. This reappropriation happens through religion, specifically through the dynamics of transcendence. By separating the transcendent from the immanent sphere, religion creates room for human freedom. This separation and the intensification of transcendence are crucial for the emergence of a self-sufficient immanent world, paving the way for modernity. As such, Gauchet views Christianity, particularly through its doctrine of Incarnation, as a pivotal step. Incarnation, for Gauchet, affirms the autonomy of the immanent world while continuing to intensify transcendence until its final dissipation. This balance between world-negation and world-affirmation is exemplified in Protestant “inner-worldly asceticism”, which eventually leads to modern individualism and the self-sufficiency of the immanent sphere from which, Weber argues, capitalism emerged in Europe. As Gauchet stresses, globalization and the dramatic economic growth experienced by Asian countries with traditions experienced, have, however, rendered obsolete Weber’s thesis about an intrinsic link between Protestant ethics and economic development.<sup id="fnref1:72"><a href="#fn:72" class="footnote-ref">72</a></sup> The problem has changed. It is now the emergence of an appropriation of capitalism and more widely of Western instrumental rationality by cultures that want to hold on to their cultural specificities and historical experiences, opening the prospect of a new polycentric world system.</p>
<p>This civilizational challenge constitutes another aspect of the contemporary crisis of Western democracy, which, for Gauchet, is not solely the product of economic determinants but is rather rooted in <em>structural—</em>to simplify, instrumental<em>—autonomy</em>. From this conflict two interpretations arise: one emphasizing individual freedom aligned with market ideologies—what Gauchet describes as opening the path for the limitless dynamics of the neo-liberal juridical-technical-market complex—and the other reflecting a populist desire for collective control and sovereignty.<sup id="fnref1:73"><a href="#fn:73" class="footnote-ref">73</a></sup> This conflict of interpretations leads to a paralysing antagonism that highlights the need to address deeper issues, including the existential anxiety produced by modernity’s disenchantment and the erosion of traditional metaphysical explanations of the place of human life within the cosmos, through a deeper understanding of human autonomy which includes the mystery of human rationality grounded in creative imagination.<sup id="fnref1:74"><a href="#fn:74" class="footnote-ref">74</a></sup></p>
<p>Building on this analysis, Gauchet views the ecological crisis as a critical test for democracy, emphasizing the limitations of addressing environmental issues through the same rational mastery that created them. The current focus on climate change—masking the depth of the environmental challenge— exhibits the disconnection from nature, the artificial way of life that modern societies have built and more widely the loss of the symbolic alliance that always connected the destiny of the human species to that of its cosmic home.<sup id="fnref1:75"><a href="#fn:75" class="footnote-ref">75</a></sup> In <em>Le nœud démocratique</em>, Gauchet returns to the question first raised in the last section of <em>Le Désenchantement du monde</em> but neglected in his later work: that of the religious after religion or to put it in contemporary terms, that of the relationship between spirituality and autonomy, which leads back to the question of the post-secular.<sup id="fnref1:76"><a href="#fn:76" class="footnote-ref">76</a></sup> He even goes so far as to state that this spiritual widening of the understanding of autonomy can perhaps offer a way out of the crisis of the modern understanding of the political.</p>
<p>Gauchet’s analyses of democracy, secularization and his theory of modernity offer valuable insights into the socio-political dimension of the human condition and the current crises facing democratic cultures. When examining these aspects of Gauchet’s work, the depth and relevance of his insights form a compelling case for a closer examination of his ideas. However, although Gauchet’s work has been translated into several European languages—including Spanish, Italian, German, Portuguese and Greek—most of his intellectual contributions have yet to be translated into English. Increasing the English translations of his work would help his insights be disseminated more broadly and given the thorough consideration they deserve.</p>
