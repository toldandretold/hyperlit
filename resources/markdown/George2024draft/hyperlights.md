I would be surprised if he was not — as a Marxist — more dialectical.

This is absolutely not the view of Marx. See his work on Capital on primitive accumulation. It is the result of class forces and class struggle, which are inherently political.

This is an awful reading of Marx who was never an “economist”, but who wrote political economy which aimed at helping people to change the world.
