The G77 sought to transcend what they saw as ongoing colonial features of the post-World War II world order, defined as the rules and institutions designed to manage the world capitalist system. The NIEO project aimed to overturn Northern protectionism; increase the stability and diversity of Southern economies through the creation of new institutions; and increase the power of the South in global institutions. International Relations (IR) theory, both Orthodox and Critical, has either ignored the NIEO, or constructed it as an authoritarian attack on global liberalism that had little to no chance of succeeding. With new archival research and a relational historical materialist approach, this thesis traces the rise and decline of the NIEO as a political project and challenges these assumptions. First, it argues that the systemic reforms advocated by the G77 were not based on a rejection of liberalism, but on the premise that the post-war order was not \u201cliberal\u201d enough. Second, it shows that experiments in a NIEO came very close to being launched and offers an explanation of how G77 state elites might have succeeded. This history of the NIEO contains important insights into the role that non-Western agency and power have played in the post-war order. Not only did G77 state elites, in relying on the wider \u2018Third World Project\u2019, offer a powerful critique of the post-war order, they created a viable strategy for its reformation. This is significant for several reasons. First, it challenges the assumption of Critical IR theory that the power of the United States was so overpowering that non-Western agency was insignificant to the post-war order. Second, it questions the prevalent assumption of Orthodox Liberal Internationalism that only liberal states create liberal international institutions and orders. These assumptions are embedded within Eurocentric narratives that conceive the post-war order as the sole creation of the United States. Such narratives are used to frame the present crisis of world order as a result of the rise of non-Western powers, and a failure of American leadership. Any potential for non-Western states to participate in reforming world order is viewed as unprecedented and is certainly not linked to any possibility of global movements encompassing the world\u2019s poorest states. This thesis revises such historical narratives, and in doing so, sheds light on the present crisis. A more general implication of this is a historically justified optimism. The NIEO was built by decades of work by many Third World intellectuals, diplomats, and states people. Their collective praxis culminated in evidence that amidst the uncertainties of world economic crises, global projects aimed at reforming world order can create viable power and are therefore worth pursuing.",

It does this by showing that the NIEO Project was powerful, and so could have succeeded in reforming the post-war liberal order, or the rules and institutions created in an attempt to sustain global capitalism through the promotion of free trade. The NIEO was a project brought to the United Nations by the state elites of the Global South, who caucused as the Group of 77 (G77). The historiography of the NIEO project has concluded, with near consensus, that it failed because it was insufficiently powerful. This is despite renewed efforts by historians, following the Great Recession, to reassess this aspect of the NIEO. I contribute to this historiography by showing that, despite its eventual demise, the state elites of the G77 had created a powerful contingency plan that offered genuine possibilities for the reform of world order. Secondly, by exploring the foundational ideas of the NIEO, I confirm what historians have known for some time, but which has been ignored by orthodox International Relations theory. The NIEO was not opposed to global liberalism. Rather, the NIEO project provides further evidence of the important contribution made by the non-Western state elites to the so-called post-war liberal order. I make these historical arguments in order to contribute towards Amitav Acharya\u2019s stated goal of a \u2018Global IR\u2019.[^1] That is, this thesis offers new knowledge of the importance of non-Western agency and power to International Relations by working towards and drawing upon a global, rather than parochially Eurocentric, historiography of the post-war era.

These contemporaneous works are secondary sources on the NIEO, forming part of the first draft of its history. However, they are also primary sources, in so far as they are indicative of how the NIEO Project was perceived during its campaign, and in so far as its authors witnessed meetings of the North-South Dialogue. The NIEO Project entered three broad stages. Initially, following the successful show of unity at the Sixth Special Session of the UN General Assembly, in 1974, the G77 state elites had created a moment of possibility, and this is reflected in some of the works published in these years. By the end of the Paris Conference on International Economic Cooperation (CIEC, 1975-77), however, the G77 state elites had not launched any of the actions that had warranted the initial promise of possibility. That is, the strategic basis of the G77\u2019s power was not followed through on. It became instead a historically curious, past potentiality. As such, the NIEO Project entered a period of stalemate which eventually dissipated into a full realization, following the international debt crisis, that G77 elites would not achieve the reforms they had sought.

This interpretation has been partially challenged by historians, most notably by Vijay Prashad, who writes of the NIEO, despite its failure, as a powerful movement.[^6] Indeed, Prashad\u2019s history has been followed by discussions about the role of contingency in the failure of the NIEO Project.[^7] Nevertheless, these works have not been able to show how the NIEO Project might otherwise have been successful.

Before Prashad\u2019s work, scholars from various disciplines, such as Amrita Narlikar who studies multilateral diplomacy, and Antony Anghie who studies the philosophy and history of <mark class='unknown-user_1739148344805' id='unknown-user_1739148344805' data-listener-attached='true'>international law<\/mark>, continued to agree with the assumption that the NIEO Project\u2019s failure indicated either a flawed strategy on the behalf of the G77, as Narlikar argues by reference to Weiss, or the overwhelming power of neocolonialism manifest in the structure of post-war order, as concluded by Anghie.[^40] It is within this context that Prashad\u2019s histories, both *Darker Nations* and *Poorer Nations*, are highly significant for both the history and theory of world order. While Prashad\u2019s work still concludes that the NIEO Project failed because of \u2018the Atlantic project\u2019, that is, at the hands of the Global North, his history is nevertheless conscious of the fact that too much should not be concluded from the way that history unfolded. That is, to Prashad an important part of the story is the use of agency by the G77 state elites. In particular, Prashad writes that the decision by many G77 state elites to welcome \u2018IMF-driven globalization, is as responsible for the assassination of the Third World as the social forces (imperialism and finance capital) that were its major adversaries from the 1950s onward.\u2019[^41] Prashad\u2019s work, therefore, as a macro history that contextualises the NIEO as part of a wider, anti-colonial \u2018Third World Project\u2019, details multiple causal factors in his explanation of the failure of the NIEO Project. While such a work is, therefore, unable to pinpoint exactly what would have had to have been different for the NIEO Project to have succeeded, or to have been more successful, it has certainly paved the way for further questioning of the NIEO. In the literature that has followed Prashad\u2019s there exists a deep concern with the importance of contingency, and the potential that the NIEO, despite its failure, might have been powerful. Nevertheless, this research has been unable to determine exactly how powerful the NIEO Project was, or to explain how it might have succeeded.",

                    "While the interpretation forged in the wake of the failure of the NIEO project, which saw it as the inevitable result of the inadequate power of its underlying strategy, has not been disproven, moves to reassess this assumption were commenced by the Marxist historian Vijay Prashad. Before Prashad\u2019s work, scholars from various disciplines, such as Amrita Narlikar who studies multilateral diplomacy, and Antony Anghie who studies the philosophy and history of <mark class='unknown-user_1739148344805' id='unknown-user_1739148344805' data-listener-attached='true'>international law<\/mark>, continued to agree with the assumption that the NIEO Project\u2019s failure indicated either a flawed strategy on the behalf of the G77, as Narlikar argues by reference to Weiss, or the overwhelming power of neocolonialism manifest in the structure of post-war order, as concluded by Anghie.[^40] It is within this context that Prashad\u2019s histories, both *Darker Nations* and *Poorer Nations*, are highly significant for both the history and theory of world order. While Prashad\u2019s work still concludes that the NIEO Project failed because of \u2018the Atlantic project\u2019, that is, at the hands of the Global North, his history is nevertheless conscious of the fact that too much should not be concluded from the way that history unfolded. That is, to Prashad an important part of the story is the use of agency by the G77 state elites. In particular, Prashad writes that the decision by many G77 state elites to welcome \u2018IMF-driven globalization, is as responsible for the assassination of the Third World as the social forces (imperialism and finance capital) that were its major adversaries from the 1950s onward.\u2019[^41] Prashad\u2019s work, therefore, as a macro history that contextualises the NIEO as part of a wider, anti-colonial \u2018Third World Project\u2019, details multiple causal factors in his explanation of the failure of the NIEO Project. While such a work is, therefore, unable to pinpoint exactly what would have had to have been different for the NIEO Project to have succeeded, or to have been more successful, it has certainly paved the way for further questioning of the NIEO. In the literature that has followed Prashad\u2019s there exists a deep concern with the importance of contingency, and the potential that the NIEO, despite its failure, might have been powerful. Nevertheless, this research has been unable to determine exactly how powerful the NIEO Project was, or to explain how it might have succeeded."

Here, I rely on a relational historical materialism that draws upon both Robert Cox\u2019s understanding of the interrelatedness of ideas and material forces, or what Bieler and Morton call the \u2018material structure of ideology\u2019.[^59] This is to understand the creation of ideas as, in part, a response to the material forces shaping a given historical moment. It is also to understand the conditions of any historical moment as shaped, in part, by the past creation of ideas. In the case of the NIEO, I show this by demonstrating that the three core ideas that formed its intellectual foundations were created in direct response to the interwar crisis, and the conditions of post-war neocolonialism. While explaining the creation of these ideas as a material-ideational response to the history of capitalism, I also explore the NIEO\u2019s objectives in terms of what liberal IR theorists call the post-war liberal order. In doing so, I argue that, despite being based partly on the work of Marxists, like Kwame Nkrumah, the core ideas of the NIEO should not be considered a \u2018major attack on the liberal international order\u2019.[^60] Rather, the NIEO was based on historical analyses of the post-war order that criticised it for not being liberal, or free trade, enough. While the NIEO Project certainly did not advocate laissez-faire, all its proposals were designed in order to transcend the legacies of both formal colonialism and neocolonialism so that, in the future, world order could work as its ahistorical liberal boosters already assumed it did. Any protectionist proposals were not sought so as to inhibit free trade. Rather, free trade, having never existed, was viewed as an ahistorical construct that served to hide a world order shaped indelibly by its actual history of colonisation. Founded on such a historical understanding of global capitalism, the ideas that underlay the NIEO Project did not, as a result, give up on free trade, or its benefits. Rather, the NIEO Project sought to assist in the creation of a world order in which comparative advantage *would* allow all states to benefit.

                    "A relational historical materialist approach is also useful for explaining the historical context that made the NIEO Project possible. Here, I rely on a relational historical materialism that draws upon both Robert Cox\u2019s understanding of the interrelatedness of ideas and material forces, or what Bieler and Morton call the \u2018material structure of ideology\u2019.[^59] This is to understand the creation of ideas as, in part, a response to the material forces shaping a given historical moment. It is also to understand the conditions of any historical moment as shaped, in part, by the past creation of ideas. In the case of the NIEO, I show this by demonstrating that the three core ideas that formed its intellectual foundations were created in direct response to the interwar crisis, and the conditions of post-war neocolonialism. While explaining the creation of these ideas as a material-ideational response to the history of capitalism, I also explore the NIEO\u2019s objectives in terms of what liberal IR theorists call the post-war liberal order. In doing so, I argue that, despite being based partly on the work of Marxists, like Kwame Nkrumah, the core ideas of the NIEO should not be considered a \u2018major attack on the liberal international order\u2019.[^60] Rather, the NIEO was based on historical analyses of the post-war order that criticised it for not being liberal, or free trade, enough. While the NIEO Project certainly did not advocate laissez-faire, all its proposals were designed in order to transcend the legacies of both formal colonialism and neocolonialism so that, in the future, world order could work as its ahistorical liberal boosters already assumed it did. Any protectionist proposals were not sought so as to inhibit free trade. Rather, free trade, having never existed, was viewed as an ahistorical construct that served to hide a world order shaped indelibly by its actual history of colonisation. Founded on such a historical understanding of global capitalism, the ideas that underlay the NIEO Project did not, as a result, give up on free trade, or its benefits. Rather, the NIEO Project sought to assist in the creation of a world order in which comparative advantage *would* allow all states to benefit. The difference between the ad hoc protectionism in the North, and the proposed protectionism under the NIEO project, was that the NIEO Project was, as paradoxical as it can seem on first reading, consciously designed to seek more, not less, free trade. Thus, I show in this chapter that the NIEO was, according to the definitions of Orthodox IR, a liberal project."

In doing so, I explain the OPEC state elites not as offering a promise of robbing from the oil-importing Western states in order to give to the oil-importing non-Western states, but as building and leading an alliance with their G77 colleagues in order to hedge against a worsening of the world economic crisis.

Thus, John Ikenberry\u2019s work relies on a historical narrative that conceives of the post-war order as shaped solely by the West, and assesses the non-West only in terms of a rising and authoritarian China.[^71] Georg Sorenson, in assessing the present crisis of global liberalism, argues that liberalism will always be faced by the inherent paradox of extending pluralism to illiberal regimes.[^72] Sorenson\u2019s argument is grounded in an assumption that only liberal states seek to create liberal institutions.[^73] Here, again, the treatment of the non-West as insignificant to the creation and maintenance of liberal world order, while simultaneously existing as an inherent threat to liberal world order, continues. Essentially, the post-war order is understood by traditional IR theory as the sole creation of the West, because only liberal Western states seek to establish liberal world orders. While the post-war order was benevolently bestowed upon 'the rest\u2019, these illiberal states served either a non-role of insignificant weakness, or a role of a dangerous threat to the very orderliness of the post-war liberal order."

Cox argued, in *Social Forces, States and World Orders*, that all theory is historically constructed, and that as such all theory can be assessed in terms of its awareness of its own historical conditioning.[^90] At one extreme is critical theory, which through an understanding of its own historical construction calls for historical research to guide the process of theorising. At the other extreme is problem solving theory which, via ignorance of its own historical construction, is unable to critically interrogate its own founding assumptions. For Cox, this meant that a problem solving theory, while useful for understanding problems within its given historical context, would legitimise the status quo world order from which it emerged. Orthodox IR \u2013\u2013 Realist and Liberal Internationalist theory \u2013\u2013 is problem solving theory in so far as its ahistorical assumptions are held a priori, assumed to be eternal and universal. While these theoretical approaches demand empirical research, they do not require historical research \u2013\u2013 research into the causal mechanisms driving change through time, via an interpretation of available primary source records.[^91] As a result, their theoretical assumptions guide and shape research, so that anything beyond the purview of the theory\u2019s terms of reference is easily precluded from analysis.

                    "That Orthodox IR is incapable of relying on a historical investigation into the important turning points of world order, in order to question its own Eurocentric assumptions about the post-war order, is explainable in terms of a Coxian critique of \u2018problem solving theory\u2019. Cox argued, in *Social Forces, States and World Orders*, that all theory is historically constructed, and that as such all theory can be assessed in terms of its awareness of its own historical conditioning.[^90] At one extreme is critical theory, which through an understanding of its own historical construction calls for historical research to guide the process of theorising. At the other extreme is problem solving theory which, via ignorance of its own historical construction, is unable to critically interrogate its own founding assumptions. For Cox, this meant that a problem solving theory, while useful for understanding problems within its given historical context, would legitimise the status quo world order from which it emerged. Orthodox IR \u2013\u2013 Realist and Liberal Internationalist theory \u2013\u2013 is problem solving theory in so far as its ahistorical assumptions are held a priori, assumed to be eternal and universal. While these theoretical approaches demand empirical research, they do not require historical research \u2013\u2013 research into the causal mechanisms driving change through time, via an interpretation of available primary source records.[^91] As a result, their theoretical assumptions guide and shape research, so that anything beyond the purview of the theory\u2019s terms of reference is easily precluded from analysis. As Orthodox IR has been shaped by the discipline\u2019s larger history of Eurocentrism, it has continued to assume Eurocentric narratives.[^92] This is a problem because Orthodox IR, as problem solving theory, is not equipped to uncover such assumptions.

That is, I argue that the G77 state elites had created genuine possibilities for the reform of world order. For this to be tenable, I must be able to dispel the arguments of scholars who allege that the G77, as a group, was so unwieldy that it had never possessed the collective power necessary to negotiate its demands.[^225] These scholars argue that the G77 elites were only able to maintain unity by ignoring their many intra-group conflicts.

Such a strategy could not, however, have been effective where it mattered most, in negotiations over the implementation of the NIEO proposals. In this and the following three chapters I challenge this interpretation. Here, I show that at the launching of the NIEO campaign at the Sixth Special Session of the UN General Assembly, the position of the G77 was not brittle or non-negotiable. The G77 state elites were able to negotiate with the Northern elites while simultaneously renegotiating their own intra-G77 compromises. This, I argue, is evidence of the adaptability of the collective power created by the G77 state elites. Rather than ignoring their internal conflicts of interest, the G77 elites continuously renegotiated them. In this way, I improve in this chapter upon interpretations of the NIEO, and the Sixth Special Session, as a solely North-South conflict. Central to the construction of a collective power capable of reforming world order was the negotiation of South-South conflicts, and also instances of North-South cooperation.

Many scholars have, from the 1970s onwards, assumed that the initial optimism for a new international economic order rested upon the prospect that the G77 elites could extend the OPEC\u2019s strategy to the cartelisation of other commodities.[^226] Such a conclusion, when it is the sole explanation for the G77\u2019s initial projection of power, can lead to an easy dismissal of the NIEO as having never stood a chance of success.[^227] This has not, however, been the sole interpretation of the G77\u2019s position. Works, both contemporaneous and especially more recently, have avoided such conclusions.[^228] The counter interpretation is that while non-oil commodity producers did seek to form commodity cartels, this was not intended to give them great power, at least not in the short run. Realising that establishing commodity price stabilisation would often require agreement between producer and consumer states, the G77 elites had instead been optimistic about commodity price stabilisation because they thought that OPEC investment could render such schemes viable. Thus, while on the one hand the NIEO Project is interpreted as having been based on the prospect of an extension of commodity power to non-oil commodities, the alternative view is that it was realised at the outset that only OPEC elites had a new source of power, in the form of petrodollars, and therefore that strengthening an OPEC\u2013\u201cNOPEC\u201d alliance was central to the formation of the collective power of the NIEO Project. This latter explanation is confirmed by the research in this chapter. I show that the tension between these two broad groups of elites played the most significant role in intra-G77 debates. Furthermore, I show evidence that G77 elites from oil-importing states were well aware, at the Sixth Special Session, that they would not be able to replicate the OPEC\u2019s strategy in isolation. As such, in demonstrating that the G77 was able to transcend its internal conflicts of interest, I show that it was able to offer a genuine negotiating platform, rather than a mere rhetorical projection of demands, and I show that this rested upon a compromise that enabled material clout: the potential that the OPEC elites might invest their petrodollars into the NIEO Project.",

For example, when Somalia argued that clauses on South-South cooperation should be discussed solely within the G77, Mr. Driss, representing Tunisia, countered by arguing that \u2018although the draft\u00a0Declaration had been prepared by the Group of 77, the\u00a0members of that Group wished to hear the views of other\u00a0delegations in order to be able to reformulate the text in a\u00a0spirit of compromise.\u2019[^237] This view, that for the necessity of finding a consensus between the G77 and other states, the G77 would have to allow sufficient flexibility for its individual member states to discuss, within the *Ad Hoc Committee*, their own preferences for and interpretations of amendments, was both widely held and acted on.

Such statements occurred both in arguments between different G77 members, and between G77 members and members of other groups. For example, when Somalia argued that clauses on South-South cooperation should be discussed solely within the G77, Mr. Driss, representing Tunisia, countered by arguing that \u2018although the draft\u00a0Declaration had been prepared by the Group of 77, the\u00a0members of that Group wished to hear the views of other\u00a0delegations in order to be able to reformulate the text in a\u00a0spirit of compromise.\u2019[^237] This view, that for the necessity of finding a consensus between the G77 and other states, the G77 would have to allow sufficient flexibility for its individual member states to discuss, within the *Ad Hoc Committee*, their own preferences for and interpretations of amendments, was both widely held and acted on.

Importantly, this was not simply illusory, a projection sustainable at the time only because of a lack of information. Rather, at that point it was possible that the G77 might actually initiate the South-South cooperation needed to make further threats of economic warfare believable. This was because of the uncertainties of a world economic crisis that was not yet explainable by orthodox economic theory, and the fact that the future was, as always, in the hands of human agency. Then, when G77 elites were optimistic about the prospects of a new international economic order, plans for economic warfare were discussed at the highest ministerial level of the G77, and the OPEC.

Central to the analysis of the memorandum was its emphasis that US policy should serve to assist in giving the upper hand to the more conservative members of the G77, so as to take the power away from the more radical members.

The concern displayed in the memorandum, and its advice to make concessions that went against the United States\u2019 perceived interests, is indicative, I argue, of the power that the G77 had gained, even when their threat of economic warfare was only a possibility.

However, OPEC state elites would have been increasingly more inclined to disinvest their dollars the more that their dollars were losing exchange value. Likewise, OPEC investment in novel experiments such as the Common Fund would have been relatively less risky if the prevailing world order was itself not holding up. In worsened conditions of global capitalist crisis, when the value of the US dollar was declining, G77 elites would be far more likely to take tangible actions towards creating new international economic orders, because there would be far less to lose by abandoning the prevailing system. This is to consider the plans for a New International Economic Order not as something to ram through at all costs, but rather as an important contingency plan, created by G77 elites because it was unknowable, at the time, how bad conditions would get."

Coalitions, which can form around a specific issue, can be adaptive, because they are based on the self interest of members acting for instrumental purposes. However, the G77, as a negotiating bloc, was according to Narlikar formed more because of a commonly shared identity, for ideational rather than instrumental purposes.

Thus, it is argued, both by Weiss and Narlikar, that the G77\u2019s unity rested on its ability to discuss issues of broad principles, and, as such, it could simply never seek to resolve what were, at the level of the actual implementation of these principles, irreconcilable conflicts of interest.[^331] To Narlikar, this is further elaborated upon via a distinction she draws between coalitions and blocs. Coalitions, which can form around a specific issue, can be adaptive, because they are based on the self interest of members acting for instrumental purposes. However, the G77, as a negotiating bloc, was according to Narlikar formed more because of a commonly shared identity, for ideational rather than instrumental purposes. It is for this reason, Narlikar argues, that the G77 was good, during the North-South dialogue, at \u2018proposal-making and blocking\u2019 but not flexible enough to actually negotiate.[^332]"

Thus, Mr. Paul Ilamoko-Djel, Ambassador of Chad to Belgium, after stating that the wealthier developing countries should \u2018help those at the lowest stage of development\u2019, stated also that \u2018developing countries should awaken to the fact that their economic partners would be impressed by their solidarity in the campaign against poverty only if they began to agree on joint plans and programmes to help one another effectively and resolutely, thus showing their will to achieve collective economic self-reliance.\u2019[^364] For others, like Mr. Frank Abdulah, Ambassador and Permanent Representative of Trinidad and Tobago to the United Nations in New York, such strategic South-South solidarity had already been fostered by the \u2018awareness that the developed countries were unwilling to help bring about a new international economic order\u2019. As such, developing countries were determined to \u2018mobilize their individual and collective resources\u2019 and \u2018increase their bargaining power for negotiation with developed countries on such matters as commodity prices\u2019.[^365] These statements provide evidence that, at UNCTAD IV, G77 state elites believed that if material support was given by the OPEC member states to the poorer developing states, the negotiating position of the G77 would be strengthened. Thus, the OPEC was not just called upon for support, but the alliance between the OPEC and the oil-importing developing states was also talked up, in attempts at projecting G77 power. For this reason, Mr. Osman Hashim Salam, State Minister for National Economy of Sudan, stated that \u2018The increased power of some groups of developing countries had changed the world financial situation to an unpredictable extent.\u2019 Furthermore, Salam wished to comment on the \u2018rumours about differences of opinion among the developing countries\u2019. He stated that the developing countries had \u2018unanimously supported the proposals in the Manila Declaration and Programme of Action\u2019 and \u2018hoped to enter into a constructive discussion with the developed countries.[^366] In this way, the public pronouncements of G77 representatives at the plenary sessions of UNCTAD IV can be read, just like those at the Sixth Special Session, as a dialogue not just between North and South, but between South and South, and for the specific purpose of fostering and projecting the collective power that underlay the movement, something that was believed to be possible only if the wealthier developing states lent material support to the poorer.",

                    "Interestingly, these calls for material support from the OPEC were not based solely on the need for development assistance, but were made also with the explicit goal of strengthening the strategic position of the G77. Thus, Mr. Paul Ilamoko-Djel, Ambassador of Chad to Belgium, after stating that the wealthier developing countries should \u2018help those at the lowest stage of development\u2019, stated also that \u2018developing countries should awaken to the fact that their economic partners would be impressed by their solidarity in the campaign against poverty only if they began to agree on joint plans and programmes to help one another effectively and resolutely, thus showing their will to achieve collective economic self-reliance.\u2019[^364] For others, like Mr. Frank Abdulah, Ambassador and Permanent Representative of Trinidad and Tobago to the United Nations in New York, such strategic South-South solidarity had already been fostered by the \u2018awareness that the developed countries were unwilling to help bring about a new international economic order\u2019. As such, developing countries were determined to \u2018mobilize their individual and collective resources\u2019 and \u2018increase their bargaining power for negotiation with developed countries on such matters as commodity prices\u2019.[^365] These statements provide evidence that, at UNCTAD IV, G77 state elites believed that if material support was given by the OPEC member states to the poorer developing states, the negotiating position of the G77 would be strengthened. Thus, the OPEC was not just called upon for support, but the alliance between the OPEC and the oil-importing developing states was also talked up, in attempts at projecting G77 power. For this reason, Mr. Osman Hashim Salam, State Minister for National Economy of Sudan, stated that \u2018The increased power of some groups of developing countries had changed the world financial situation to an unpredictable extent.\u2019 Furthermore, Salam wished to comment on the \u2018rumours about differences of opinion among the developing countries\u2019. He stated that the developing countries had \u2018unanimously supported the proposals in the Manila Declaration and Programme of Action\u2019 and \u2018hoped to enter into a constructive discussion with the developed countries.[^366] In this way, the public pronouncements of G77 representatives at the plenary sessions of UNCTAD IV can be read, just like those at the Sixth Special Session, as a dialogue not just between North and South, but between South and South, and for the specific purpose of fostering and projecting the collective power that underlay the movement, something that was believed to be possible only if the wealthier developing states lent material support to the poorer."

As such, changes in the economic crisis during this period had a profound effect on the North-South dialogue. Such changes are also fundamental in changing the position of the OPEC state elites, from actively projecting themselves as willing supporters of the NIEO, to failing to significantly support experiments in new international economic orders. My essential argument here is that the less stable the status quo world order was, the less risky, in relative terms, was investment in a new international economic order. If, that is, the OPEC state elites were not gaining sufficient stability in their earnings under the status quo world order, they would be far more likely to support experiments in unprecedented new international economic orders. Likewise, a calming of the world economic crisis would have served to discourage investment in a new international economic order. To show that this did in fact occur, I rely on key economic indicators that demonstrate that the economic crisis that had served to position the NIEO Project as an important contingency plan, calmed, from 1975 to 1977, serving to position the NIEO Project as relatively riskier than remaining with the status quo.

This was because the risks of the OPEC state elites investing in a new international economic order were not greater, or at least not significantly greater than the risks of remaining with what was left of a status quo. A new international economic order was a way of forming a multilateral compromise that had some prospect of bringing order to chaos, while also addressing long-term structural problems that Third World state elites, relying on a Third World intellectual project, could all agree upon."

I explain that the strengthening of bilateral relations that this arms trade represents should not be taken to signify a dependence by either Saudi Arabia or Iran on the United States. Rather, it was the power of petrodollars and the needs of the United States, as much as anything else, that enabled the Saudi and Iranian state elites to purchase such large quantities of advanced weaponry during the 1970s. With these purchases made possible by the OPEC\u2019s oil price hike, and with this contingent on the stability of world order, it is just as true that the sale of arms was a force pulling these OPEC state elites closer to support for US hegemony as it was a possible weapon that these OPEC state elites could have used, by withdrawing such purchases of arms, to threaten that US hegemony.",

I explain that the strengthening of bilateral relations that this arms trade represents should not be taken to signify a dependence by either Saudi Arabia or Iran on the United States. Rather, it was the power of petrodollars and the needs of the United States, as much as anything else, that enabled the Saudi and Iranian state elites to purchase such large quantities of advanced weaponry during the 1970s. With these purchases made possible by the OPEC\u2019s oil price hike, and with this contingent on the stability of world order, it is just as true that the sale of arms was a force pulling these OPEC state elites closer to support for US hegemony as it was a possible weapon that these OPEC state elites could have used, by withdrawing such purchases of arms, to threaten that US hegemony."

From 1971 to 1975, it purchased 1 billion dollars worth of arms. From 1976 to 1980, it had purchased 4.2 billion dollars worth of arms. This had almost doubled again in the next pentad.

To do this, I first explain the emergence and consequences of the debt crisis. I show that it had been allowed by a US unilateralism that at first ignored the issue, and then precipitated it, and I show that it had disastrous consequences for the lives of millions of people in Latin America and Africa. Secondly, I argue that a debtors\u2019 cartel, if possible, would have been powerful. I do this by showing that those states which could project a genuine threat of default gained better deals from their creditors than those that did not. Furthermore, I show that creditors were genuinely fearful of a general debtors\u2019 default.

While a successfully formed debtors\u2019 cartel would have been powerful, I agree with previous analysts that it would have been very difficult to pull off. Nevertheless, I add to this analysis by contextualising the failure to form a debtors\u2019 cartel within the rise and decline of the initial collective power that had underlined calls for a new international economic order. I show that the formation of a debtors\u2019 cartel was made significantly unlikely because the confidence in collective action had been squashed when OPEC state elites did not invest in the NIEO as they had initially suggested that they would. Thus, I find that the prospect for a debtors\u2019 cartel during the 1980s was nearly nonexistent. Nevertheless, I do argue that if the G77\u2019s initial strategy had been followed through on, at the CIEC, the historical context would have been far more ripe for a debtors\u2019 cartel. This is because tangible moves towards South-South solidarity would have strengthened the resolve to experiment with similar strategies, and legitimised the belief that G77 unity was, or at least could be, a significant power.

This was not easy or inevitable. Indeed, the main basis for the power of the NIEO stemmed from the OPEC\u2019s new petrodollar surpluses. These same surpluses, however, were a symptom and a cause of a global trade imbalance that added further costs to some of the poorest G77 members.

Nevertheless, the ideas of the NIEO allowed these elites to see beyond the short term, so as to transcend their very real material conflicts of interest, and stand in unity to call for reforms that were seen to hold long-term benefits. This was not easy or inevitable. Indeed, the main basis for the power of the NIEO stemmed from the OPEC\u2019s new petrodollar surpluses. These same surpluses, however, were a symptom and a cause of a global trade imbalance that added further costs to some of the poorest G77 members. Thus, in the early 1970s, the G77 state elites had to use the underlying ideas of the NIEO to create unprecedented diplomatic compromises, in order to produce a collective power that could be wielded in a way that truly benefited all its members. It was by transcending very real material conflicts of interest, via creative diplomacy, that the NIEO Project was created."

Evidence for the potential fruits of such endeavours can be found in the work of Christy Thornton, who traces important historical foundations of the NIEO within Mexico.[^506] In particular, further archival research, or even interviews, detailing the strategic thinking of Saudi Arabia during this period could prove essential for strengthening knowledge of the high point of the North-South dialogue, and the reasons for its collapse. Looking beyond the NIEO, and towards its significance for the wider history of world order, much could be gained by connecting this story with more overtly economic analyses of the changes occurring during this period. Recently, orthodox economic historians have framed the post-war golden age of capitalism as itself the exception, as a novel space and time in which wages could rise in keeping with productivity so that inequality declined.[^507] This period ended in the crises of the 1970s, something which, in turn, highlights the importance of Marxist analyses which have, for much longer, considered the 1970s to be an important turning point in world capitalism.[^508] This more overtly economic work could provide better explanations for the context from which the crises of the 1970s, which the G77 elites responded to and sought to take advantage of, emerged. Whereas this thesis focuses more narrowly on the NIEO itself, when seeking to extend this research to the wider history of the post war order, it will be essential to connect it to the economic work discussed above. This will enable an analysis of the decision making of historical actors caught up within economic crises to be foregrounded with a macro historical analysis of the development of these crises themselves. This, I hope, could prove fruitful for a more macro-historical sociology of world order, one that can explain the relation between the creation of the rules and institutions of world order to the crisis-propelled history of world capitalism, with a view to focusing on the key moments in which historical actors had the most power to alter the course of this history.
