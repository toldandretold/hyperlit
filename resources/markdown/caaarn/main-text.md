## Crush fascism before it grows: Vital lessons from the past

\[Image: \]\[Image: \] This unemployed woman living in Weimar Germany advertises her skills. Her sign says, “Hello! I’m looking for work. I can do shorthand and typing, can speak French and English, will accept any type of household job and can do anything that demands an attentive mind.”

Reclaim Australia (RA) and the United Patriot Front (UPF) are the faces of a fascist movement in the making. They trumpet anti- Muslim bigotry, anti-LGBTIQ and anti-Left demagoguery. Right now, they target refugees and immigrants. Like all neo-Nazi movements, they use scapegoats to divert attention away from the real cause of people’s distress: living in a capitalist system that is disintegrating. In the service of corporate capital, they aim to turn working people against each other in order to crush our capacity to organise and revolt.

In Australia, each time fascists have poked their head up in public, determined resistance has driven them back. Today, the Campaign against Racism and Fascism (CARF) is building a united front to stop them from growing. From history, we know that if UPF and RA are successful, the result will be the spread of racist hate and ultimately murderous violence against workers and all oppressed minorities. From history, we also know that a united working class movement can defeat them.

Fascism becomes an option for the capitalist class in times of economic crisis. The corporate élite needs productive workers to bolster profits and maintain its privilege. Fascist movements use scapegoats to divert people’s anger at the widening misery, build a popular base and head off a revolution. Following WWI, Jewish people were targeted as the root of all evil, just as the UPF is now targeting the Muslim community.

In 1933 Germany, Hitler’s National Socialist (Nazi) Party was elected into government with the financial backing of heavy industry (IG Farben, Thyssen etc). Today fascist parties, such as Golden Dawn in Greece, the National Front in France, UKIP in Britain and Jobbik in Hungary, have had parliamentary success in Europe. The Australian Liberty Alliance, recently registered as an electoral party, mirrors the anti-Islam platforms of its European fascist counterparts. Nazi Germany showed what fascism does when it’s in power.

## Fascism’s rise.

After the First World War, Germany was governed by the Social Democrats, a bourgeois democratic party, similar to Australia’s Labor Party. Through the parliamentary system, they were able to keep workers on side while serving the interests of business. They worked with the capitalists. At all times they opposed themselves to the communists.

But the economy suffered under debilitating war reparations and losses of profitable resources and territories imposed by the imperialist Allied Powers. This posed a heavy cost, especially on heavy industry (such as mining and steel production), which already had significant production costs. Large German family companies, such as Krupps and Thyssen, had to claw back the concessions that workers had won through massive post-war strikes, such as the shortened working day and higher wages. And they had to tame the workforce. Industrial capital financed groups of far-right thugs to keep workers from organising. Around 1923, these groups coalesced under the Nazis, led by Adolph Hitler.

Heavy industry ramped up production in the mid 1920s for foreign markets. Local people did not have enough money to buy all these products, which then stockpiled in factories. However in the late ’20s, the world financial crisis hit and the markets dried up. This was accompanied by a financial banking crisis. Very similar to the recent “ GFC.” Capitalists had no option but to wind back production and cut the workforce. Unemployment in Germany in 1930 hit 4 million.

What unions won under the social democrats had to be wound back to preserve profits. But there is only so much winding back that workers will tolerate before they push back and rebel. The only solution that remained to stop an uprising was an authoritarian government, capable of subjugating the working class. Again the heavy industrialists, in particular Thyssen and Kirdorf, leapt in and funded the Nazi party. By 1930 bankers were also underwriting the National Socialists.

Today, the global economy is in tatters, and Australia is not immune. The gap between the rich and poor increases steadily. Our unemployment rate stubbornly refuses to go down and, as in 1920s Germany, the true rate is probably much higher than what we’re told. During the financial crisis of 2007-2008, the governments of Germany, the U.S. and England rushed to prop up failed banks. Greece has debts similar to what Germany suffered under the Versailles Treaty. People are pushing back against brutal austerity measures. In Greece, we see the rise of Golden Dawn, just as the Nazis did in the 1920s. In Australia, the UPF is on the move, but nowhere near as organised. The time to stop it from growing is now.

## Historical lessons.

How do we fight and defeat fascism? Leon Trotsky wrote extensively about fascism and how to fight it through a united front. Trotsky was a leader of the 1917 Russian Revolution, alongside Vladimir Lenin. He led the Red Army, which defended the world’s first socialist revolution against local and foreign capitalists seeking to overturn it. Trotsky saw that the social democratic parties, working in capital’s interest, were not the workers’ friends. Their policy of appeasement toward fascists opened the parliamentary door to fascism’s seizure of power. Trotsky spoke strongly against the “ignore them and they will go away“ attitude of centre parties and union bureaucracies (something we see now in response to the UPF).

Trotsky said that capitalists know only one law: profit. Either parliamentary democracy, which keeps the class struggle in check, or the bludgeon of fascism is acceptable — whichever protects profit and staves off rebellion. Capitalists prefer the former, because it’s peaceful and cheaper. But when the economy nosedives, concessions must be quashed. The peace is broken and the iron fist becomes necessary.

The middle classes (small businesses) were also brutally squeezed by big capital. Stuck between two mighty, conflicting forces — labour and capital — they looked to whoever they thought would save them. They hated the big capitalists, but the working class was divided and weak. Into the breach stepped the iron fist. The middle class became the fascism’s social base.

Fascism could have been defeated. The Nazis were successful, because they were not countered with a strong united front of workers. The consequences of a fractured opposition were terror, murder and the decimation of the working class. The winners were Thyssen, Siemens and Volkswagen.

## Divided we fall.

A united front is the coming together of diverse and divergent working class organisations, based on an agreed set of principles to deal with the task at hand. It reflects the struggle as it exists on the ground. It is led by working class demands, and democracy is crucial.

The united front forms to defend the working class against being dismembered by big business through fascism. Political differences are respected, and organisations march separately with their distinct slogans. But they strike together, based on the agreed points of unity. “Whoever wants the victory of proletarian justice over fascist violence must agitate for the struggle and set up the organs of the proletarian united front,” Trotsky tells us.

Without cooperation, no such front can be built. Fascism’s targets remain disunited and leaderless. The Social Democratic party worked with business to keep the workers quiet for as long as they could. They feared revolution and refused to join forces with the Communist Party (CP). On the other hand Stalin, leader of the Soviet Union after Lenin’s death, counselled the German CP not to join with the social democrats to fight fascism. Treating the Social Democratic Party as an opposition, the CP even coined the term “social fascism,” thereby lumping the fascists and social democrats together. This approach opened the door for the Nazis to march in unhindered.

## United we win!

Conditions in late capitalism are worse than the 1920s, but they are not uniform. Some countries are nearly bankrupt. Social reforms are continuing to be wound back under neoconservative governments of all stripes. Wealth is now more than ever concentrated in the hands of a tiny élite. Golden Dawn has just increased its vote in the Greek election and is in third place.

The Australian far right is not so advanced. But it is organising, and it understands the value of history. Workers need an historical memory, too. Hitler told the world that the Nazis could have been smashed when they were small and weak. Trotsky told us that a working class united front would do this.

Campaign Against Racism and Fascism — a united front of socialist, anarchist and Aboriginal justice organisations and activists — recently endorsed its points of agreement. CARF is ready to broaden into a front that links all of fascism’s targets — unionists, Left, immigrants and refugees, First Nations, feminists, LGBTIQ, everyone.

The union movement is crucial. This is where workers, of all genders, sexualities and backgrounds, are organised. This movement has the capacity to mobilise working people and our communities. The bureaucracy — tied to our social democrats, the Labor Party — wants to ignore the threat. But CARF’s organising core is union members and delegates, directly linked to the membership. CARF can win over the union movement via the workplace.

The Freedom Socialist Party and Radical Women are veterans of anti-fascist campaigns in the 1980s and ’90s, which ran neo-Nazis out of town. Both are founding members of CARF. To get involved, contact FSP <freedom.socialist.party@ozemail.com.au> or RW <radicalwomen@optusnet.com.au>

## For a United Front Against Reaction

### Extract from *Towards the ’90s: Approaching the Final Conflict*

Clara Fraser and Guerry Hoddersen

[*Freedom Socialist*](https://socialism.com/fs-article/towards-the-90s-approaching-the-final-conflict-part-v/) \| June 1989

*“Towards the ’90s” is a dynamic analysis of the recent progress and current prospects for the world class struggle. Written on behalf of the National Committee of the Freedom Socialist Party, its assessment and optimistic conclusions were endorsed by the party’s September, 1988 National Convention.*

This document was originally published in the *Freedom Socialist* newspaper in special supplements to Vol. 11, No. 3 (June 1989); Vol. 11, No. 4 (February 1990); and Vol. 12, No. 2 (October 1990).

## V. Our strategy and tasks

The job of a vanguard is to be out in front, leading the way to higher levels of struggle and consciousness.

Through working in the mass movements and conducting regularized education, propaganda, and agitation, the party helps prepare the working class and its allies for the titanic struggles to come.

The current relationship of class forces, and the mood of the times, point toward a stepped-up tempo of clashes with bosses, bureaucrats, super-patriots, warmongers, venal politicians, bigots, and neofascists. Our place is at the head and in the center of these battles. Our role is to explain again and once more again the source of problems — the system itself.

To the milquetoast programs of the middle caste, who worship capitalism, we counterpose a radical program of truth and reality, of meeting needs for self-defense and multi-issue organizing. And if we stand alone or in the minority or temporarily excluded, so be it. Someone will hear us just so long as we speak up!

James P. Cannon, founder of American Trotskyism, said it best:

> The great Marxists — beginning with Marx and Engels … and ending with Comrade Trotsky, they all had a common characteristic: a complete indifference to public opinion. They did not care what the rest of the world thought about them. They figured out their line of policy in every case according to their scientific ideas. Then they courageously applied it and took the consequences.[^1]

Words to live by. And when we do, we discover that we can weld progressive forces into a kaleidoscopic front against reaction.

The time is ripe and the opportunities great. The tottering old system is making our job easier! Capitalism digs its own grave, doing its own spade work and preparing the ground for revolutionary feminist ideas and for our dynamic intervention into the new, radicalized mainstream politics.

## Strengthen the Party and RW

There is no substitute for vanguard organizations which inspire, teach, train, test, and develop the cadres for struggle. No modern revolution is made and sustained without such organizations. They are unique, irreplaceable, and precious because they are so few and far between, and because the cry for leadership is so deep.

The disparagers of vanguards are those who not only don’t want to be up front leading anything; they don’t want anybody else to be there either.

Building the party and RW are every bit as important as our mass work.

And guiding, training and assisting RW is the most important mass work we do!

Our precious sister organization is vital to the party — the best schoolhouse we have for women leaders, a source of many party recruits, of both sexes, and an excellent, appealing vehicle for bringing socialist feminism to the public.

Doors are open to RW which are often closed to FSP. TV and radio talk shows, press coverage, college classrooms, the conference circuit-all offer RW many opportunities. And RW can usually obtain that all-important status as an official campus organization, putting us in touch with students and providing great resources.

RW’s growth and development are not secondary for the party, but primary.

Sometimes it is difficult to maintain a balance between external and internal activities, but our leadership must constantly strive toward balance by regular evaluation of our priorities and regular shifting of personnel as indicated.

An equilibrium will strengthen everything we do. If we spend all our time in mass work and little on theoretical education, skills training, fundraising, financial reports and records, administration, headquarters upkeep, public events, and quality time with good contacts, our membership will make too many mistakes, because they will have a weak grasp of program, history, and organizing techniques. If our own organizations and branches are hamstrung by administrative backlogs and financial bottlenecks, we can hardly presume to teach others how to create and run effective organizations.

And we won’t attract new people if we’re too busy racing around to other events to hold forums, educationals, classes, and fundraisers of our own.

We will always be pulled in many directions simultaneously and there will always be more to do than we can handle, especially now when the Left is moving right and more and more is demanded of us as interest quickens in socialist feminism.

The key to achieving a balance of activities is to strengthen our ranks with intensive theoretical education.

We’re only as good as our grasp of the accumulated wisdom, experience, theory, and spirit of Marxism, feminism, Revolutionary Integration, Trotskyism. Knowledge is our ballast in the storm, our guide to action and effectiveness. And what we fundamentally have to offer the struggle for human liberation is the body of our ideas.

As *Crisis and Opportunity* reminded us, “Permanent Revolution teaches that revolt and great ideas are contagious and cannot be long suppressed. Their time always comes.” Strengthening our own understanding of these ideas assures us that when we meet the future, we will be ready for it.

One of the most consequential ways of preparing for the future is to recruit today. The times they are a’changin’, and more people are attracted to us. Socialist feminism strikes a responsive chord in this period among working women, people of color, students and intellectuals, independent feminists, and youth.

To make the most of these new opportunities, each branch must have a Membership/Recruitment Coordinator whose attention is focused on getting to know potential recruits, assessing their interests and skills and needs, setting up dinners and social occasions for discussion purposes, and attending to their educational development.

Also, being a new recruit doesn’t instantly transform a person into a revolutionary. Bolsheviks are made, not born; new comrades warrant quality time and attention from organizers and education specialists, not just before but after they join. That’s the secret to augmenting our basic cadres with new recruits. And to grow means emphasizing recruiting by painstakingly organizing it.

## Win the Freeway Hall Case

When ex-FSPer Richard Snedigar dragged the party into court in 1984, demanding return of a gift he had given us, he and his grasping attorneys thought it would be easy to destroy us.

All they had to do was subpoena our membership lists, minutes, and financial records, and smear us as cultish crazies who ripped off the public.

Instant cash, publicity, and political pay-offs from grateful city politicians would be theirs. Or so they thought.

But their greed, arrogance, male chauvinism, and vulgar anti-communism boomeranged. In their rush to fame and fortune, they forgot whom they were trying to burn at the judicial stake. Our record for dousing these bonfires is unsurpassed.

In the four-and-a-half years since they filed their ugly case, they’ve received a chastening lesson in dialectics. The case to smash the FSP has turned into its opposite — it has become a national and even international rallying point against redbaiting, government snooping, and the intimidation tactics of the right.

Far from sullying our reputation or injuring our fundraising, the case has won us widespread if sometimes grudging admiration and endorsement, and we earned every bit of it by strenuously defending our right to a gift freely given and put to use as promised. By exposing the McCarthyite motives and tactics of the Snedigar cabal and by our patent determination to go to jail rather than surrender First Amendment rights, we garnered overwhelming support for our principle and defiance, and we isolated Snedigar. He has no positive support, even from bureaucrats and opponents who hate us and grumble about our case.

Our tenacity and passionate belief in the justice of our cause, and the unbelievably dedicated and relentless labors of the legal and outreach teams, brought us this far.

Victory is assured so long as we keep expanding our circle of support and demonstrating our intransigence. We will be eventually vindicated by the very legal system that Snedigar et al. intended to use to smash us.

The year 1988 will be a pivotal one in this historic courtroom battle. The judicial system absolutely refuses to give us a hearing on our First Amendment issues, despite repeated confrontations over our refusal to turn over privileged information. So be it. We’ve been blocked and stymied before, but our membership is wholly committed to seeing this fight through, and it shows! We shall muster the resources to triumph … we shall remain invincible!

Still, it takes even more than correct policy and magnificent fighters to win a war like this one. It takes money, broadscale people-power, and getting the word out endlessly and creatively. Over \$65,000 has already been expended in legal fees, and thousands more on PR and informing our supporters and the media.

*Fundraising*, therefore, must be at the top of our to-do list.

We have hired an energetic and effective *case coordinator*, but she is as yet only part-time. To obtain more money, publicity, speaking engagements, and endorsements, and to build a strong defense committee, which is highly important, we need at least one full-timer, if not more.

The N.O. and the Secretariat and the Seattle branch spend an enormous amount of time on the case, and this impacts negatively on other work. Increased funds would enable us to hire skilled people for the case, which would release our staff and membership to focus on other issues as well. We cannot become unilaterally absorbed by and obsessed by the case — that would be capitulation to the very intent of Snedigar and Co., and it is a tribute to us that not one branch has allowed this to happen. Our basic work goes on, and our *balance* is relatively unimpaired.

## Send a Party Delegation to Nicaragua

The unfolding, tortuous Nicaraguan revolution is the most decisive political event in North America.

Like the 1959 Cuban Revolution, the Sandinista phenomenon is a pole of attraction for every progressive who thinks there might be a better way to organize society than cutthroat capitalism. This fact explains the fascination the revolution holds for people around the globe and why so many Americans visit there yearly.

A revolt against U.S. imperialism captures the hearts and minds and affinities of millions.

Sending a party delegation to Nicaragua is long overdue. It is a vital aspect of our own education and our task of building a radical antiwar movement. We simply cannot speak with the same authority as those who have seen the revolution firsthand and can back up their opinions on what it means and where it is correct or misguided.

We need to go there ourselves in order to learn and observe — and also to demonstrate support and to help.

The party has a unique position in the American Left regarding the Sandinistas’ disastrous Indian policy and their reliance on liberal Democrats to forestall U.S. intervention, which has a crippling impact on the antiwar movement. The Sandinistas need to hear from us on these and other questions, and we could learn much in direct discussion with Nicaraguan feminists, Indians, unionists, officials, artists, and radicals of all breeds.

A priceless opportunity for intervention and learning beckons. If we don’t travel now, we will pay for it later.

## Run Candidates for Office

The ’80s offer the party a golden opportunity to throw its hat in the electoral ring.

Disgust with both capitalist parties is snowballing, as evidenced by the low voter turnout in November 1986 and ever since. Only 37% of the electorate went to the polls in ’86, the lowest turnout since 1942!

Voters today cast their ballot on the basis of issues and candidate personality rather than party affiliation. And since Republicans and Democrats agree on almost everything, most workers simply tune out the candidates and drop out of the electoral charade. Socialists running a highly visible campaign can turn them on again; in today’s electoral circus, a campaign that focuses on issues would be a welcome novelty.

Two strategies for intervention are open: we can slate our own candidates or build left coalitions around a united socialist ticket. Each alternative has advantages and disadvantages.

Electoral coalitions can present a strong and attractive *leftwing alternative* to the capitalist parties.

They provide an arena for *collaboration* with other Left parties and independent radicals.

They offer opportunities for *clarifying ideas* through discussion and debate among radicals on program and strategy.

They *strengthen* the Left.

They give a campaign a *broad base* from which to build support.

They engender media interest.

But they are also enormously time-consuming and nerve-wracking, tricky to get off the ground, and difficult to hold together.

Mounting a campaign for an FSP candidate, on the other hand, gives the party a *free hand* in developing the program, scheduling the candidates, utilizing fully the priceless PR opportunities, and focusing on *recruitment*. We have the advantage of knowing that once we undertake such an effort, we will finish it.

But we would have to organize the campaign by ourselves, even with help from supporters, and this effort is expensive and draining.

In either case, we must start working NOW to establish the FSP as an electoral party. Workers and the media take a political party seriously only if it competes in the electoral arena.

## Build a Dynamic Antiwar Movement

As war draws nearer with every U.S. helicopter that ferries Honduran soldiers to the Nicaraguan border, the party must aspire to build a *radical* antiwar movement.

Nothing sends terror trickling faster through the corridors of Wall Street and Washington, D.C., than the specter of an anti-capitalist, multi-issue, internationalist antiwar movement in the U.S.

The system can absorb a large single-issue movement that folds up shop when the shooting ends for a while. But a movement that grasps the connection between imperialist terror abroad and a home front beset with a permanent war economy, soaring unemployment, inflation, homelessness, hunger, racism, sexism, homophobia, political repression, and union-smashing — now *there* is a grasp that’s dangerous.

Mass radicalization is the greatest fear of the ruling class and the best weapon for stopping the next war wherever it erupts.

The ranks of the antiwar movement are, as ever, ahead of their leaders; the reflex of the ranks is multi-issueism. What we need to do is fight for our right to speak about multi-issueism in an *anticapitalist* context. No one else is going to do that.

Enough already with rostrums filled with bourgeois feminists, Democrat careerists, treacherous liberals, unctuous preachers, and undercover or single-issue radicals enamored with popularity but secretive about program. FSP and RW represent the only upfront anti-capitalist wing of the movement; we demand equal time!

If we maintain a steady propaganda campaign around the war/capitalism/austerity connection, we will reach those of like mind, who have been silenced by the bureaucrats. Our job is to spot the real people and work with them patiently and confidently to push the movement leftward and to swell our own ranks.

We were acknowledged leaders and spokespersons of the movement during Vietnam. We did it before and we can do it again.

## Prepare for an Independent Labor Party in the U.S.

The call for a workers’ party — or, as it is popularly called in the U.S., a Labor Party — could not be more timely.

In their thirst for majority appeal, the Democrats are racing to the right, chasing after the Republican constituency and rapidly shedding their undeserved image as representatives of “special interests,” i.e., labor and the specially oppressed. This rush to the rear, plus their pro-war stance, are shattering the illusion that workers and the poor can find shelter or welcome in the folds of that moribund party.

The rightward drift of the Democrats is bound to become more pronounced as the presidential election nears. The Rainbow Coalition was barely tolerated the first time around; it will be given even shorter shrift by the party machine the second time. Said an unnamed senior Democratic strategist in the April 20, 1986 *Chicago Tribune*: “The only candidate who can win not only the nomination but the election is the one who can tell Jesse to buzz off.”

A similar buzz-off message will no doubt be delivered to labor as well.

This is good news for U.S. radicals. The accelerated erosion of the Democratic Party — the traditional mechanism of equilibrium between the rulers and the middle caste — opens up new opportunities for education and agitation around the need to form a party of, by, and for working people.

Now, when we speak of an independent workers’ party, what exactly are we talking about? A Labor Party of the type found in Europe, Canada, Australia, and elsewhere?

Hopefully not. While these parties originally sprang out of the demand for a union-based electoral alternative to the big bourgeois parties, they were quickly saddled with social democratic leaderships and roped into serving as the loyal opposition and pillars of the status quo. They exist today to maintain a reformist equilibrium in the class struggle while their leaders assist in managing the bourgeois state. They are far to the right of the workers they claim to represent and in whose eyes they are largely discredited.

These established labor parties are analogous to Democrats in the U.S., with one important difference: Democrats are backed by big business just as heartily as Republicans. They may take union money to help pay campaign expenses, but no formal obligation to labor goes with it, and precious little union power over elected officials derives from it.

Unlike the labor parties abroad, the Democratic Party is avowedly *bourgeois*, openly created and controlled to serve capitalist interests. U.S. “democracy” has historically had the resources to forestall and coopt efforts to build workers’ parties; the government promotes, via the Democrats, the myth that everyone can be equal under the system.

That myth needs to be punctured for good by providing an *alternative* to it, one that appeals to the growing desire among workers for independence from ruinous bourgeois party policies.

Existing labor parties around the world are wholly identified with procapitalist reformism — or, more precisely, they are identified today with *taking away* reforms because of capitalist austerity programs. This isn’t the type of workers’ party we advocate. We want one that will truly represent the interests of working people, the poor, women, people of color, lesbians and gays — all the left-outs and have-nots of U.S. society.

In the U.S., the concept of a workers’ party is, as yet, to the left of most workers. In fact, much of the importance of organizing for such a party lies in how it would spur development of the proletarian *class-consciousness* that U.S. workers lack. Formation of a U.S. workers’ party presupposes a *break* with reformism and its custodians, the Democrats.

U.S. voters would love an alternative to the twin-party shell game, as the less-than-30% election turnout proves. Proof also is Jesse Jackson’s popularity in the current presidential campaign. His themes — corporate greed and the need for social justice — have struck a nerve in the electorate; he has drawn the biggest and most enthusiastic crowds of all the candidates. His candidacy shows the colossal impact that an independent workers’ party could have on U.S. politics.

When the Democrats shunt Jackson aside a second time, perhaps more U.S. radicals will realize that the only road to impact and influence on the electorate is precisely an independent party.

Inevitably, in the surge toward a U.S. Labor Party, left-leaning sectors of the middle caste will scramble to climb aboard and take control. It’s up to radicals to wage a fight inside the party to ensure that the most oppressed workers’ interests are truly represented.

Given that forming a workers’ party in the U.S. almost certainly depends on a radical shift in the political climate, the chances are excellent that radicals could successfully fight for leadership.

In any case, just as in Europe, etc., there is no going around labor’s middle caste in building an independent, revolutionary workers’ movement. The task for radicals, whether inside or outside a workers’ party, remains to wean workers away from class-collaboration illusions and win them toward revolutionary politics. This may mean building alternatives to existing labor parties, or working within them to topple the social democratic leadership, or working within and without as a radical alternative to reformism. However it’s done, it means a direct struggle with the middle caste for the hearts and minds of the working class.

An independent third party would provide, for the reasons above, the most favorable arena for a radical struggle against the U.S. labor bureaucracy. We may soon find out: the Democratic Party is a sinking ship, and calls are being raised across the land for some sort of independent electoral action.

It should be noted that social and economic crisis and the disaffection with the twin parties may take on a momentum that carries U.S. workers straight past all constrictions of a labor party into a revolutionary socialist party, a far more decisive answer to the Democrats and Republicans.

FSP should introduce resolutions in our unions calling for a Labor Party and also launch a public educational campaign around the workers’ party, drawing in unionists, socialists, movement activists, and promising youth. This is much easier to do between presidential elections, before the labor generals get their forces lined up to ram through an early endorsement of the Democratic hopeful, and before liberals start their quadrennial shrieking about the coming Armageddon should a Republican win.

Nevertheless, as scandals in the White House unfold by the hour, and Democratic presidential hopefuls hit the dust daily, this is a great time to highlight the corruption of the two-party system and to pose the workers’ party alternative and its glowing prospects.

## Form a United Front Against Reaction

Unions, the Left, and all the oppressed and afflicted are not united in a common effort to repulse the assaults on them. Each defense is built from ground zero by those under the gun. The mushrooming multiplicity of fronts stretches the resistance forces unmercifully.

To the demoralizing strategy of fighting each new outrage seriatim, the party counterposes the call for a multi-issue united front standing ready to move quickly on a broad range of concerns.

A united front is composed of a variety of workers’ organizations “marching separately and striking jointly” against capitalist reaction. The front is closed to no one — professionals, students, politicians, business people — but its **program and leadership** must serve working class interests. Otherwise, it will be sabotaged by the liberal bourgeoisie and funnelled into capitalist politics.

Trotsky and Lenin developed the united front strategy in the years following the Russian Revolution, when the Third International guided revolutionists all over the world. As conceived by Trotsky and Lenin, the united front strategy serves several purposes.

## Unity

The united front is the organizational means for attaining united action.

All workers, regardless of political affiliation or views, know that solidarity is the best way to advance their aims and fight a powerful enemy.

## Mass Struggle

The united front is the road to mass action.

By combining the forces of workers’ parties, unions, and mass movement groups, the united front opens up the possibility of massive struggle against bosses, government, and reactionaries.

This popular struggle in and of itself is radicalizing.

Wrote Trotsky:

> … The greater is the mass drawn into the movement, the higher its self-confidence rises, all the more self-confident will that mass movement be and all the more resolutely will it be capable of marching forward, however modest may be the initial slogans of struggle. This means that growth of the mass aspects of the movement tends to radicalize it, and creates much more favorable conditions for the slogans, methods of struggle, and in general, the leading role of the Communist Party.[^2]

## Leadership Selection

The united front offers revolutionaries a chance to reach reformist and pseudo-radical organizations, to work with them, and to let them see for themselves which leadership is most resolute, most capable of defending their interest, and most sensible! Wrote Trotsky:

> We are, apart from all other considerations, interested in dragging the reformists from their asylums and placing them alongside ourselves before the eyes of the struggling masses. With a correct tactic we stand only to gain from this.[^3]

Trotsky also pointed out the difficulties in united front work.

The middle caste leadership has a gut-level antagonism to united, concerted action because they “dread the revolutionary potential of the mass movement.” Reaching agreement on how the front will function, and around what issues, is difficult. Bureaucrats instinctively detest mass action.

“In many cases,” wrote Trotsky, “perhaps even the majority of cases, organizational agreements will be only half-attained or perhaps not at all.” Even when agreement is achieved, the united front may be sabotaged or held back. In such a case, the party is not bound to an absolute discipline in action with the front, and may have to break with it in order to lead the struggle independently.

Despite these difficulties, Trotsky urged the Third International to “assume the initiative in securing unity in these current struggles.”

We must raise the united front strategy in the unions, with other Left parties, and in the mass movement. As coalitions, committees, and ad hoc groups proliferate, the capacity to combine forces expands. We must go to the middle caste and propose it at the same time as we organize the ranks to push for it.

Even if we are unsuccessful in this or that instance, the party will prove its commitment to defending the working class. And that will be remembered.

\[Image: \]\[Image: \]The Fight Against Fascism in the U.S.A. , by James P Cannon, Farrell Dobbs, Joseph Hansen, Leon Trotsky and Murry Weiss, Resistance Books (2004), ISBN 1876646179, 237 pages, \$19.95.

In January 1997, a fascist outfit, National Action (NA), opened a bookshop in the multicultural Melbourne suburb of Fawkner. This development led to the reactivation of Campaign Against the Nazis (CAN), a united front of socialist organisations and progressive activists which years earlier drove these neo- Nazis out of nearby Brunswick. CAN again mobilised the broadest possible, disciplined protests to prevent National Action from putting down roots in Fawkner.

It also sparked a range of very familiar debates about the best way to respond to the threat of fascism. Members of the ALP, who dominated the local council, argued that the community should ignore NA, claiming that they’d just go away. In contrast, the International Socialist Organisation (ISO) called on the council to ban the group. The ISO previously had taken a similar approach of appealing to the State, demanding that the local council stop rightwing populist, Pauline Hanson, from using council buildings. The council obliged with a resolution that refused “divisive groups” access to facilities. It was no surprise when CAN — which was organising the community in expelling the fascists — got a phone call from the council to warn it about the new policy!

*The Fight Against Fascism in the U.S.A.* is a fascinating collection of public and internal documents from the archives on the U.S. Socialist Workers Party, spanning the period from the 1930s to the 1970s. The debates thrown up during real struggles are essential reading for those serious about learning how to fight fascism.

Veterans from anti-fascist struggles put a compelling case that socialists should **never** appeal to the State to restrict the rights of any organisation — even fascists! But the contributions also deal with the subtleties of which tactics best suit conditions in different periods.

A 1939 contribution, “Should Fascists Be Allowed the Rights of Free Speech?,” urges working class activists not to be led off course by professional liberals and civil libertarians. It points to the hypocrisy of organisations like the American Civil Liberties Union: “The ACLU, apparently exhausted by its noble efforts on behalf of the Nazis, did not utter a peep about the democratic rights of free speech, assembly and picketing being denied the 50,000 anti-fascists who came to protest the Nazi rally.” The piece advises socialists to keep the emphasis squarely on the democratic rights of anti- fascists to demonstrate and speak out — not get caught up in abstract debates about liberals’ agendas.

In 1960 the Mayor of New York denied the American Nazi Party, led by George Lincoln Rockwell, a permit to hold a rally. SWP veteran, James P Cannon, was alarmed by the development and wrote to New Yorker Tom Kerry: “It sets a dangerous precedent. The reason he gave for denying the constitutional rights of the American ‘Nazi’ screwballs, and his incitement to violence against them, can be applied just as well and just as logically to us or any other minority. We will be greatly handicapped in fighting against such discriminations if we give direct or even indirect sanction to this treatment of others. People who demand free speech and constitutional rights for themselves but want to deny it for others do not get much public sympathy when their own rights are denied.”

**Theory and tactics.** As well as providing useful insights into developing the most appropriate tactics, the collection educates about social movement history. The introduction by Malik Miah, a Black civil rights activist who was a leader of the SWP for many years, explains the centrality of this question for Trotskyists. It was the failure of the mass socialist and communist parties of Europe to unite and use the power of the working class to stop the rise of fascism that led to the formation of the Fourth International after Trotsky concluded that these parties could not be reformed. Miah explains: “The political strategy of the Marxists, called Trotskyists, remains a key method of struggle to take on rightist formations and incipient fascists. The SWP was an active participant and builder of the anti-fascist movement. The SWP members, particularly those in trade unions, followed a strategy of counter-mobilisation to fight the incipient fascist groups and advocated the formation of workers’ defence guards to defend working class organisations. Liberals who opposed fascists, on the other hand, focused on relying on the capitalist courts and legislatures to stand up to the fascists.”

A key issue addressed in the book is how to recognise fascism and incipient fascist movements. While agreeing with the importance of confronting Rockwell and his Nazi Party, Cannon says: “the real American fascists look more like Mayor Hague, Senator McCarthy, possibly Senator Goldwater. It can be put down with absolute assurance that in no case will they wear Nazi uniforms, swastikas and praise Hitler. To picture Rockwell’s outfit as representing American fascism thus helps create the illusions that the real fascists, when they show up, will be identifiable with similar ease and will similarly openly stir up the most violent antipathies, including those of the most patriotic Americans.”

The opening selection in the collection is a pamphlet titled *Father Coughlin: Fascist Demagogue* , written by Joseph Hansen. During the 1930s, in the context of economic crisis and widespread disillusionment in President Roosevelt, various fascist movements began to emerge. One was called the Social Justice Movement, led by Reverend Charles E Coughlin, the “radio priest” whose speeches were broadcast on 48 stations. Hansen clearly explains what fascism is: “First, it is a wide mass movement of farmers and small business who face bankruptcy, of youth denied a future under capitalism, of sections of the unemployed. All these layers of the oppressed who are seeking desperately to put their hands on the surrounding plenty become hypnotised by the silver-plated promises of a demagogue who regiments them into blindly obedient shock troops.

“Secondly, it is financed and controlled by the very capitalists who above all are anxious to keep the revolutionary violence of the masses from turning against them. In America — the DuPonts, the Morgans, the Rockefellers — the Sixty Families.

“To the rank and file followers of fascism, at first it seems a genuine revolutionary way out of their misery. They discover the truth too late. The capitalists provide the money. The dictator provides the powerful slogans, the stirring names, the demagogic program, the organisation, the lieutenants, and the oratory.”

In short, fascism is used by the capitalist State as a last resort in the face of growing working class dissent. Fascism crushes bourgeois democratic norms in order to save the free market and private property.

Coughlin used a great deal of social justice rhetoric, but among his 16 points for social justice was a call for the preservation of private property. “Devotion to capitalism and preservation of private property,” argues Cannon, “is the holy bible of fascism.” Coughlin opposed social security, advising the ruling class to regiment labour and quash its capacity to fight big capital. He was pro-war and proselytised the need for a bigger army and navy. His “vision” for addressing unemployment was of jobless youth “marching behind bayonets.”

Another invaluable selection is Joseph Hansen’s response to two comrades who argued that Senator Joseph McCarthy was not an incipient fascist, as characterised by the party majority, but merely a “bourgeois democrat.” Hansen acknowledged that, at the time, McCarthyism was far from being fully formed fascism. McCarthy hadn’t built his own party, instead continuing to operate as a faction in the Republican and, to some extent, Democratic Party ranks. But his aim — the destruction of bourgeois democratic norms — was clear, hence the characterisation of him as an incipient fascist.

## Building broad support.

The Freedom Socialist Party’s (FSP) Trotskyist tradition of fighting fascism is firmly rooted in this book. The FSP split from the SWP in 1966 around a range of questions, including opposition to Black nationalism and the centrality of women’s liberation.

A fascinating piece in the book is by Murry Weiss, a leader of SWP in Los Angeles who later joined the FSP. Weiss reports on organising against Gerald LK Smith. At the end of World War II, there was a revival in fascist activity. In 1945 Smith embarked on a national tour of the U.S. with the aim of building a mass base. Weiss describes a situation where the leadership of most sectors in the union movement were passive, and the leadership of the Stalinist Communist Party was tailending the unions. In this climate, the challenge was how to mobilise mass opposition. Weiss describes how the SWP was able to build united front action among the ranks of Stalinists, which eventually forced the Communist Party to come on board.

The emphasis of the SWP campaign was to make the organised working class conscious of who Smith was and why he was so dangerous. Weiss explains, “the line of the campaign was to mobilise the organised forces of the working class for a struggle against Smith. We reasoned: Smith is here to build a mass movement; to win financial support from the influential capitalists; to organise combat groups; to unite all reactionary forces under a single banner; to explode the tinder box of racial tension into riots and pogroms; to turn it all into an attack on the labour movement and on the unemployed who tomorrow will struggle for jobs and security. But Smith is only in the initial stage of his campaign. Therefore we must not allow him to gain time and a foothold but we must smash back with great power and boldness, with overwhelming preponderance of force.”

The key message of *The Fight Against Fascism in the U.S.A.* is that incipient fascist movements must be identified early and confronted by a broad, democratic and disciplined united front. Taking on rightwing populists and fascists must be done collectively, not in an individualistic or adventurist manner. We also need to assess the balance of forces. In a short piece about organising during the depression era, Felix Morrow says, “a very fruitful discussion can be had on the extremely delicate problems connected with calling upon the workers to fight against the fascists: when to speak purely in defensive terms, and when to go over to terms indicating an offensive against the fascists.”

When 50,000 people responded to the SWP’s call to action, despite the opposition of union, liberal, social democratic, Stalinist and mainstream “leaders,” *that* was an anti-fascist movement exercising its democratic right to free speech! This happened in New York on the 20th of February 1939 in opposition to plans by the German-American Bund to hold a mass fascist rally. The book is full of stories from real life struggles such as this. It is also a tool kit for how to organise a workers’ defence guard, a disciplined mass rally, or a united front. Along with classics such as *Trotsky’s Fascism: What is it and how to fight it?,* Daniel Guerin’s *Fascism and Big Business* , the feminist anthology *When Biology Became Women’s Destiny* and Helen Gilbert’s *LaRouche: Fascism Restyled for a New Millennium, The Fight Against Fascism in the U.S.A.* is an excellent addition to any serious anti-fascist fighter’s bookshelf.

## Review: Histories of Fascism and Anti-Fascism in Australia

## DEBBIE BRENNAN

[*Freedom Socialist Organiser*](https://socialism.com/fso-article/review-histories-of-fascism-and-anti-fascism-in-australia/) \| AUGUST 2023

In the past eight years, far-right movements and openly fascist groups have risen and ebbed. First they attacked Muslims and then immigrants of colour, Jews, First Nations, unionists, radicals, transpeople and queers. Each time, they’ve been met with organised resistance.

*Histories of Fascism and Anti-Fascism in Australia* was released early this year in the heat of relentless, orchestrated threats against queer events and drag story times. Two weeks before the book’s Melbourne launch, Posie Parker toured Australia and Aotearoa/New Zealand. Playing on transphobic scaremongering by the über right, this globe-trotting TERF (Trans Exclusionary Radical Feminist) from the UK came with a mission to recruit anti-trans feminists. Outside the Victorian Parliament, sieg heiling Nazis joined her tiny turnout, while cops held the much larger number from trans and queer communities and their defenders at bay.

The reaction that’s now oozing from the pustules of a rotting economic system is not abating. Only the array of its targets, striking as a unified force, can stem it. To do this, we need to know what we’re fighting, and history provides invaluable tools.

Older generations recollect fascist and extreme-right activity stretching over several decades. And this is the point of the book: to show that what we’ve experienced these past few years has a history — going back to Australia’s establishment as a white settler state.

Sixteen contributors, including editors Evan Smith, Jayne Persian and Vashti Jane Fox, bring to life some of this history from the 1920s to the 2019 mosque massacre in Christchurch, Aotearoa. All are academics or researchers. Padraic Gibson and Fox are also leading members of socialist organisations, Solidarity and Socialist Alternative respectively.

The editors’ stated aim is to show how fascism and far-right movements materialised in Australia at critical points throughout the century and how it has been confronted. As a socialist feminist involved in Melbourne’s anti-fascist organising since the 1990s, including the formation of Campaign Against Racism and Fascism (CARF) as a united front to counter the fascist and far-right resurgence in 2015, I wanted to check out this book.

**White settler state beckons fascists.** White supremacism is a dominant theme of this book. Implanted by the British invaders, enforced by the colonial authorities and enshrined in the White Australia Policy of the newly federated nation in 1901, the “protection” of the white race underpins the laws and actions of this settler state. Several contributors demonstrate how this has enabled fascist and far-right groups — be they World War II Nazi exiles, British imperial nationalists or homegrown rightwingers like Pauline Hanson.

Jordan McSwiney, Eda Gunaydin and Henry Maher expose the rhetoric of “western civilisation” and its extolling of “culture” and “values,” which is so common in parliamentary debate and mainstream commentary. Barely disguising its racist meaning, it also gives cover to far-right “west is best” propagandists — such as Stefan Molyneux and Lauren Southern, who spoke in Australia in 2018, protected by Nazis — and open fascists like the Proud Boys.

And while the White Australia Policy is ***officially*** dead, it still lives — most brutally in the treatment of refugees and First Nations. Anastasia Kanjere explains border “defence” as “an elemental moment for the legitimisation of the very existence of the white settler state.” She goes on: “Through protecting from external threat, the white settler colonial nation can guard against the ever-present anxiety of the threat of Indigenous sovereignty.” In this context, Kanjere characterises fascism as “an operative part of an ecosystem of white supremacy” — it’s inevitable.

That fascism in Australia is an ongoing, internationally connected threat is important to understand. Contributors meticulously document examples of this. We watch how, during the Depression, the anti-communist paramilitary New Guard attempted to oust the New South Wales (NSW) Labor government of Jack Lang, bringing the state to the brink of civil war. Lang’s plan to suspend interest payments on overseas loans rocked the business establishment and mobilised the predominantly small business base of the New Guard. The Loveday Internment Camp in South Australia was a hotbed of Italian fascism in 1942. After World War II, British and Australian fascists collaborated to protect the heritage of the British empire, which they feared was endangered by non-white immigration. The war also produced emigrations of Nazis and other ultra-nationalists from Central Europe. Cold War Australia was a staging ground for internationally connected emigre groups from Croatia and Hungary. The Croatian Ustasha movement, which collaborated with Hitler and Mussolini during the Second World War, carried out terrorist acts in Australia in the 1960s and ’70s. Hungarian Nazis interacted with their Australian counterparts on the basis of a shared anti-communism and white supremacism. In the 1980s aftermath of the Vietnam War, we see anti-Asian terror in Western Australia being carried out by the Australian Nationalists Movement, headed by Jack Van Tongeren.

**Resistance and solidarity.** The pieces that strike me most are those of Phoebe Kelloway and Padraic Gibson on workers’ anti-fascist organising in NSW and Melbourne, respectively. In the first half of the 1930s, almost a third of NSW unionists were unemployed, evictions were commonplace and hunger was widespread. Coal bosses locked out workers, scab labour was everywhere and police protection was violent. The Arbitration Court ruled against strikes and for a ***10% wage cut*** , and the reformist union movement leadership was useless. Fascists were organising, targeting unionists and communists. In the face of all this, combative workers’ “armies,” organised by the Communist Party, Labor Party and unions, counter-organised and fought back.

Gibson describes the internationalist solidarity of trade unions and First Nations at Melbourne’s demonstration on 27 February 1935 to mark the second anniversary of the Reichstag fire. Leading the march was Egon Kisch, a Jewish Czech communist who was representing the World Council Against War and Fascism.

Gibson highlights the importance of the First Nations presence, which he says is probably the first publicly advertised Aboriginal contingent at a workers’ demonstration in Australian history. Its place at the head of the march was a statement linking the brutal repressions of workers in Germany and Australia’s First Nations. The year before, the Australian Aborigines League (AAL) had been launched as a self-determining organisation to fight the state “protection” system and petition for representation in the Australian parliament. In 1938, AAL leader William Cooper would lead an Aboriginal delegation to the German Consulate in Melbourne to protest the persecution of Jews in the pogroms of Kristallnacht.

**But what is fascism?** It’s perplexing that nowhere in the book is fascism explained. Andrew Moore touches on various Marxist versus liberal theories, but leaves it in the air as something “incoherent and protean \[continuously changing\], reshaping itself according to circumstances.”

There’s more to fascism than that! The events in Europe a century ago inform us that, when it is imperilled, capitalism will resort to brutal force to save itself from workers’ revolt. We saw fascism in power, and we know the conditions that brought it to power. Pogroms and concentration camps made clear that the capitalist class would stop at nothing. We also have the definitive analysis of Marxists to help us examine beneath fascism’s seemingly “incoherent and protean” surface and counter-organise to ***stop*** it.

To know what fascism is, we then know what it isn’t. The book also doesn’t explain the distinction between fascism and the far right. On Hanson, for example, the editors note that her One Nation party is different from the fascist and extreme right parties under discussion, but they don’t say how. Fascists and the far right both show the bare teeth of capitalism in distress. This way, they interact and share similar outward characteristics. But fascism is a mass movement giving big capital the power to sweep aside parliamentary democracy, establish order and literally enslave the working class. This distinction is crucial.

To understand fascism as a creature of capitalism is to appreciate that white supremacism isn’t the only weapon in its arsenal. The profit system equally relies on sexism and class exploitation to survive. Fascism restores the patriarchal family to reproduce workers and enforce cisgender, binary, heterosexist “norms.” Policies enforced by Nazi Germany and fascist Italy to control women’s fertility and send queers to death camps show how central this is. Also targeted are people considered as an unproductive drain on the economy — poor, homeless and with disabilities. Unions are crushed. Revolutionary organisation is annihilated.

## How to fight it: the united front.

As the editors state, “there has never been a singular, politically homogenous anti-fascist movement in Australian history.” We need one! It’s called a united front of unions, the Left and all targets of fascism.

And from history we find examples of its potential. In his work on anti-fascist organising in Melbourne in 1935, Gibson underscores a “sentiment to build genuine united front activity against fascism and war,” which he says “was palpable across the rank and file of the workers movement in many countries at this time, driven by the feeling of existential threat created by the rise of the Nazis and smashing of the German workers movement.” *Histories* ’ introduction mentions “various individuals and organisations,” who fought with determination to kick National Action (NA) out of Melbourne in the 1990s. This was actually a united front of socialist groups and unionists which, as Brunswick Against the Nazis, was instrumental in running an NA rally out of Brunswick in 1994. Re-formed as Campaign Against the Nazis (CAN) in 1997 to face off NA again, its solid organising over 15 months successfully forced the Nazis to pack up their Fawkner “bookshop” and leave Melbourne for good.

In 2015, Campaign Against Racism and Fascism formed, as *Histories* says, to deal with the far-right Reclaim Australia. But the editors’ description of CARF as “an attempt by Socialist Alternative and other activists” to achieve this is misleading. CARF began as a united front of socialist, anarchist, First Nations justice and international union solidarity organisations as well as individuals active in social justice and their unions. Over months of democratic debate, CARF developed principles of agreement, which enabled the politically divergent groups and activists to unify around this common cause. In a united front, differences are respected, and everyone works collaboratively and accountably around the points of unity.

Socialist Alternative (SAlt) came into CARF after its formation. SAlt opposes the united front, and over time its undemocratic operating drove people out. Freedom Socialist Party, Radical Women and two other founding groups stayed to fight against this tide until it was clear that the united front could not be salvaged. CARF still operates under the control of SAlt.

The united front remains the only way to galvanise the superior power of fascism’s targets and throttle this persistent threat. The union movement is vital for this front, because this melting pot is where we organise as workers.

*Histories* gives us important, detailed accounts of past fascist and anti-fascist organising in Australia, and it positions this globally. To understand fascism and how to ***destroy*** it, more reading is necessary. I recommend *Building Unity Against Fascism: Classic Marxist Writings*. Freedom Socialist Party and Radical Women will jointly host a reading circle on this latter book, starting in October. Stay tuned!

## Book Review: A rich tradition for anti-Zionist Jews to emulate

**ALAN WOODCRAFT**, [*Freedom Socialist Organiser*](https://socialism.com/fso-article/book-review-a-rich-tradition-for-anti-zionist-jews-to-emulate/) \| JUNE 2024

The mission statement of *The Radical Jewish Tradition (RJT)* is to recover the history of Jewish revolutionaries, resistance fighters and firebrands. These stories contain not just an antidote to the distortions and suppressions of Zionism, but also point the way forward for a lasting peace in the Middle East. This book is a timely intervention by authors and anti-Zionist Jewish socialists, Donny Gluckstein and Janey Stone, who provide a powerful weapon to rescue history.

The first section discusses antisemitism and its origins, making the case that it is far from natural. The authors quote historian Richard Levy, who argues that “Antisemitism is a modern phenomenon, the origins of which can be dated precisely. The word *antisemite* , and the abstraction ‘antisemitism’ first appeared in Germany in 1879… a new word was needed to describe the new sort of… long-term activity against Jews.” This shows that antisemitism is a social construction which evolved with capitalism. It also means that it is not eternal. Gluckstein and Stone argue that the scapegoating, pogroms and oppression “will only end if the class system behind it is abolished.”

*RJT* documents the resistance by working-class Jewish radicals who understood that “the working class has the numbers and economic strength” to end the oppression. The most in-depth section of the book, titled “Revolutionaries,” provides the inspiring story of Jewish radicals in Russia, London’s East End, New York and Poland in meticulous detail.

The origins of the Russian revolution can be traced back to the pogroms and scapegoating of Jews within the decaying feudalism of the Tzarist empire. The majority of Jews were a significant part of the working class. This is why Jews developed a radical class consciousness, not only experiencing economic exploitation but religious oppression as well. This led to Russian Jews forming the first trade unions, the earliest of which was the Women’s Tailors Association in 1864. And in 1897 the first Jewish socialist political party, the Jewish Labour Bund, was formed.

The Bund was welded together by class consciousness. As a fiercely anti-Zionist organisation, instead of “fantasies of reunification” in Palestine, “the Bund grappled with the immediate reality of Jewish workers lives in situ.” It also passed a resolution declaring membership of a Zionist organisation incompatible with membership of the Bund.

Zionist leader Herzl argued that the masses were irretrievably antisemitic. But the reality of the Russian revolution — an event that radical Jews played a major role in — proved that to be false. On International Women’s Day, textile workers led an uprising that toppled the Tsar. “The very next day age-old quotas on Jews in education were lifted and on 20 March all anti Jewish laws were abolished.”

In Britain, a large Jewish community settled in the East End of London during the later part of the nineteenth and early twentieth century. The majority fleeing pogroms began life in sweatshops of the most disgusting kind imaginable, giving radicals plenty to organise around.

There were many links between “immigrant Jewish radicals and home grown socialists” with Jews having a visible presence in the annual May Day march. Eleanor Marx, a famous Jew and the daughter of Karl Marx, taught herself Yiddish so that she could help organise the newly arrived Jewish immigrants involved with East End Jewish Women Workers.

Sarah Wesker was another Jewish woman who was a formidable union organiser, leading strikes of machinists at the all-female Goodman’s trouser factory. At this time racism was being fomented via immigration controls. The Alien Act 1905 was steered through Parliament by Arthur Balfour of Balfour Declaration fame. He argued for restrictions on Jews, because “they are not to the advantage of the civilisation of the country.” Herzl, who was one of the most important architects of Zionism, was also complicit in this legislation. Fascists were organising at the same time, with the most dangerous being the British Union of Fascists. This was the environment that Wesker, a communist, was organising in. The grass roots in the East End were well networked. A large majority of the 500-strong Stephney branch of the Communist Party were Jewish. Many had close ties to the London dock workers, and some took in starving dock worker children during the bitter dock workers’ strike. And when, in 1936, the British Union of Fascists intensified its racist and antisemitic campaigning and organised a march, radical Jews were prominent among the 300,000 people participating in the Battle of Cable Street. The fascists were smashed and the people, among them radical Jews, were united and jubilant.

Zionism was always a minority project — that is until the rise of Hitler and the holocaust, when many countries excluded Jewish refugees and imposed immigration controls. The migration figures prove this beyond a shadow of a doubt. Before the holocaust, just a few thousand initially went to Palestine, whereas many millions went to New York.

\[Image: \]

\[Image: \] Staunch strikers in New York in 1909 sparked International Women’s Day.

Immigrants arriving in New York experienced slave-like conditions, struggling against vampire landlords, tyrannical bosses — many of them Jewish — a brutal police force, hired thugs, and a corrupt legal system. The militancy started when housewives successfully fought against the increased cost of kosher meat. Butcher shops had their windows smashed. This was followed by a huge rent strike. It was organised mainly by Jewish women with 16-year-old Pauline Newman leading. Although not completely successful, the lessons learned were used to win the waistmakers’ strike of 1909. Of the 30,000-strong workforce, many were young Jewish women. Newman was among the most militant, spreading support for the strike. They won better pay, shorter hours, voting rights and an end to child labour. This victory not only ignited nationwide struggles, it was institutionalised by Clara Zetkin as International Working Women’s Day.

The third section of the book tells the horrific story of the rise of fascism in Germany, the need for scapegoats and the unleashing of the Holocaust. There was mass resistance to the Nazi occupation across Eastern Europe. Jews put up fierce opposition, using anything they had to fight — boiling water, scissors, axes and more were deployed against machine guns. One of the major themes of *RJT* is opposing what it calls the “lachrymose conception” of Jewish history. Literally the tearful conception where Jews are passive victims, even to the extent of being self-victimised. The book exposes this version of history as a Zionist myth used to peddle the view that antisemitism is eternal and that the only solution is to colonise Palestine.

There is every reason to believe that had the workers movement embraced the tactic of the united front between Social Democratic Party and the Communist Party — as proposed by Jewish revolutionary Leon Trotsky — then Hitler could have quickly and easily have been defeated. But the necessary unity failed to materialise, because Stalin argued that social democracy was really no different from Nazism, branding it “social fascism.” This lesson is still relevant today.

The book concludes with a powerful balance sheet, rich with contemporary lessons. “For six decades after 1881 Jews around the world engaged in struggles against antisemitism and their exploitation and did so as conscious fighters and agitators, as socialists and radicals. Alas the counterattack was crushing. Many in the diaspora accepted the violent foundation of Israel as the answer and Zionism replaced radicalism as the predominant current in the Jewish community.” Today, many more Jews are rejecting Zionism. Be inspired by the Jewish rebels and class conscious organisers — please read this wonderfully apt book.

# Part 2 — Standing up to fascists

## The Growing Fascist Menace: What Is It And How Can We Fight It?

## ALISON THORNE & LINDA WESTE

[*Freedom Socialist Bulletin*](https://socialism.com/fsb-article/the-growing-fascist-menace-what-is-it-and-how-can-we-fight-it/) \| SUMMER/AUTUMN 1990 \| Issue 5

On 10 April 1989 members of the fascist organisation, National Action, invaded a meeting of the Lesbian and Gay Immigration Task Force in Sydney. Twelve men stormed into the meeting wearing masks and balaclavas and dressed in black. They took photographs of task force members. They also seized documents including an invitation to the group’s 5th anniversary dinner. The fascists chanted anti-gay slogans and carried placards saying “AIDS is a solution not a disease,” They were forced out of the meeting after about two minutes by furious task force members.

Members of the Lesbian and Gay Immigration Task Force said that the raid was an intimidation exercise but that it had not worked. The group had been aware of the possibility of such an invasion as they recognise themselves as prime targets for the anti-homosexual and anti-Asian politics of fascist organisations. One of the co-convenors of the Task Force told the Sydney Star Observer that security at task force meetings would be tightened up but that the raid would in no way deter the very successful work of the Task Force.

According to the *Sydney Morning Herald* of April 17 1989, the police arrested one man, 24 year old Wayne David Smith, for allegedly participating in the raid. Smith is a member of National Action and after he was arrested, National Action’s Chairman, Jim Saleam, visited the police station to give Smith support and to bail him out.

There is an alarming rise in fascist violence taking place in Sydney. The Anti-Discrimination Board, the Uniting Church and the Aboriginal Community are all targets along with lesbians and gay men. Cars with stickers supporting Aboriginal rights have been firebombed outside Tranby Aboriginal College.

Meanwhile in Melbourne fascist thugs from National Action attempted to attack a feminist march protesting ANZAC day. The only thing between us and National Action was a row of police and we certainly cannot rely on ***them*** to defend us! Left paper sellers have been attacked by National Action when selling their papers in the Bourke street mall and earlier this year Melbourne experienced the horror of a Vietnamese student being murdered on the steps of Flinders Street Station. This murder was committed by fascists.

On the weekend of the 15th and 16th of April 1989 there was a spate of fascist graffiti directed at particular targets. The synagogue in St Kilda was daubed with swastikas. Racist slogans appeared on the walls of the Community Aid Abroad office accused the organisation of, among other things, “supporting black terrorists” because of their work in support of Namibian independence. The Communist Party of Australia got the words “kill red scum” sprayed across the front of their Collingwood headquarters along with symbols of the South African Afrikaner fascist organisation AWB. Two Nazi skinheads were caught after spraying up the Synagogue but there have been no reports in the newspapers about the incident since.

In 1988 British Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher visited Australia for the so-called Bicentenary. In Melbourne we gave Thatcher the welcome she deserves: a mass demonstration protesting her policies both at home and abroad. Opposition to the anti-gay Clause 28 was one of the things that brought many people to the demo. However a small group of demonstrators had placards characterising Thatcher as a fascist. She *is* an ultra conservative right wing politician but she *is not* a fascist.

## What is Fascism?

Fascist, as a term, is used very loosely often as a political swear word against right-wing figures or reactionaries. (The word was originally taken from the Italian word *“fascio”* , meaning “bundle” or “sheaf,” a reference to the symbol of power carried by the ancient Roman consuls). The current meaning of the word fascism did not apply before the rise of Mussolini’s fascist government in the early 1920s.

When leftists are asked to define fascism terms such as dictatorship, mass neurosis and anti-Semitism are bandied around but do not give us a clear or correct definition.

But there is a Marxist analysis of fascism. It was made by Leon Trotsky during the rise of fascism and it was one of his greatest contribution to Marxism. Trotsky began by analysing what happened in Italy with Mussolini’s 1922 triumph. He then wrote extensively on the question throughout the 1920s and 30s. Trotsky made a point by point critique of those political parties which failed to realise ‘the mortal danger of fascism’. He worked hard to try to alert the Comintern (Communist International) and the German Communist Party about the danger of fascism and attempted to rally a united front to defeat Nazism.

In the pamphlet *Fascism: What Is It and How To Fight It?* Trotsky describes a political cycle, of which fascism is the final link:

*“Both theoretical analysis as well as the rich historical experience of the last quarter of a century have demonstrated with equal force that fascism is each time the final link of a specific political cycle composed of the following: the grave crisis of capitalist society; the growth of radicalisation of the working class; the growth of sympathy toward the working class and a yearning for change on the part of the rural and urban petty bourgeoisie; its cowardly and treacherous manoeuvres aimed at avoiding revolutionary climax; the exhaustion of the proletariat; growing confusion and indifference; the aggravation of the social crisis; the despair of the petty bourgeoisie, its yearning for change; the collective neurosis of the petty bourgeoisie, it readiness to believe in miracles, its readiness for violent measures, the growth of hostility towards the proletariat which has deceived its expectations. These are the premises for a swift formation of a fascist party and its victory.”*

The time when fascism can arise is when bourgeois democracy – with its police, army and parliament – can no longer keep society in a state of equilibrium. When society can no longer be held in a state of equilibrium the petty bourgeoisie really gets squeezed in the middle. Trotsky describes what can result when

*“through the fascist agency, capitalism sets in motion the masses of the crazed petty bourgeoisie and the bands of declassed and demoralised lumpenproletariat — all the countless human beings who finance capital itself has brought to desperation and frenzy.”*

So fascism finds its recruits in the middle class. When capitalism is in crisis the petty bourgeoisie are largely dissatisfied as a class, and through propaganda their indignation and despair is diverted away from blaming capitalist big business, to blaming the working class. The result is a desperate and frenzied petty bourgeoisie being used as a battering ram against the working class.

Fascism is a measure to which the bourgeoisie resorts to save capitalism by smashing the organised working class when the system is in crisis. Through fascism the bourgeoisie can do a thorough job of reorganising capital. Trotsky wrote in 1934: *“the historic function of fascism is to smash the working class, destroy its organisations, and stifle political liberties when the capitalists find themselves unable to govern and dominate with the help of democratic machinery.”*

Fascist regimes never tame the ruling class, which remains autonomous to pursue its economic goals. Fascism exists with the *support* of the bourgeoisie, which sees fascism as necessary measure for the advancement of its own financial interests. **Fascism and big business are linked**. When big business withdraws its support it is the beginning of the end for fascism as no political regime can govern against the class which holds economic power.

While fascism is the product of failing capitalism it is also the result of failing to achieve socialism. In a time a social crisis and economic dislocation if the working class does not give a strong lead to the petty bourgeoisie then the ruling class will. And when hope is lost the petty bourgeoisie will go for “strong” measures such as fascism.

## How to fight fascism

Trotsky calls for a united front as a way to fight against fascism.

In *Socialist Feminism: the First Decade,* Gloria Martin gives a good description of what is meant by the term. She says: *“A united front is a conglomerate of workers’ organisations ‘marching separately and striking jointly’ in a combined thrust against capitalist reaction. No contingent is expected to change or sacrifice its basic principles and program and each sector of the front is free to raise proposals and debate strategy for the entire movement so long as everyone strikes together. The united front is closed to no one, but leadership must be retained by the working class organisations or the ‘liberal’ bourgeoisie will seize power and defuse the movement, rendering its development into a revolutionary brigade impossible and ensuring the defeat of the workers by the ruling class. We do not engage in ‘popular’ or ‘people’s’ fronts, a Stalinist form of criminally irresponsible revisionism which ‘unites’ all classes under the hegemony of the liberal governmental forces who always proceed to compromise with the ruling class. So the key elements of a united front are both program and leadership in the interests of the working class.”*

Liberals and reformists of every stripe will urge us to ignore the fascists and not give them any attention at all. They bleat that the fascists are just seeking attention and that to protest will just give them more opportunity to promote their ideas. They propose solutions such as monitoring the actions of the fascists or lobbying the police. Trotsky answers this brilliantly when he says:

> “fascism finds unconscious helpers in all those who say that the ‘physical struggle’ is impermissible or hopeless, and demand of the Doumergue (Premier of France after Feb 6 1934) the disarmament of his fascist guard. Nothing is so dangerous for the proletariat, especially in the present situation, as the sugared poison of false hopes. Nothing increases the insolence of the fascists so much as “flabby pacifism” on the part of the workers’ organisations. Nothing so destroys the confidence of the middle classes in the working class as temporising, passivity and the absence of the will to struggle.”

Beware the pacifists who argue for inaction. We must confront the fascists toe to toe when ever they dare to show their face. Fascism must never be allowed to go unchallenged. Pacifism will just allow the germ of fascism to grow unchecked.

As well as forming united fronts to fight against fascism we also need to be prepared to form workers defence guards to defend working class newspapers, meetings and organisations from fascist attack. When a working class organisation is under the threat of fascist attack all class conscious organisations must be prepared to join the defence through a workers’ defence guard. A couple of examples spring instantly to mind.

In Melbourne National Action were harassing left wing paper sellers from both the Socialist Workers Party and the International Socialists (IS) in the Bourke Street Mall. A broad section of the Melbourne left pledged to form workers’ defence guards to ensure that any working class organisation could sell their paper without fascist interference. National Action backed off (strongly encouraged by a little physical persuasion by the IS!) and the left in Melbourne continues to distribute literature safely. In 1985 a number of meetings were held in both Melbourne and Sydney to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the liberation of Saigon. Some of these meetings were attacked by Australian and Vietnamese fascists. A meeting at the Sydney Waterside Workers’ Federation offices was delayed but went ahead with a fully equipped defence guard. Needless to say, the fascists didn’t show up.

## US United Fronts to Fight Fascism

Late last year the United Front Against Fascism (UFAF) formed in the Pacific North West of the United States just days before a Nazi skinhead gathering planned for Whidbey Island. The Nazi skinheads were gathering to commemorate the death of a notorious fascist, Robert Mathews, who had been killed on Whidbey Island in a shoot out with the FBI.

The UFAF brought together socialists, feminists, unionists, gay men, lesbians and people of colour to protest. The call for the UFAF was initiated by the Freedom Socialist Party and many groups quickly responded to the call including Seattle Gay News, the National Association for the Advancement of Coloured People, the Guardian Angels, the Stonewall Committee for Lesbian and Gay Rights, Radical Women and the Association of People Living with AIDS.

Despite shrieking calls by the media for the UFAF not to confront the fascists because confronting them “would cause violence,” in a breathless four days the UFAF mobilised 400 brave people to directly challenge the Nazis. Lesbians and gay men were out in force.

The UFAF was democratic to the core and elected three spokespersons and decision makers to give a lead to the demonstration. They were revolutionary socialist feminist, Guerry Hoddersen, George Bakan, crusading editor of the influential Seattle Gay News and long time black leader and journalist for Seattle’s Facts newspaper, Charlie James.

George Bakan delivered the strong opening statement at the rally to the effect that the people of the Northwest cannot turn their back on the fascist threat and hope it will go away. “We are here to fight the Nazis. There will be no Aryan Nation,” he proclaimed.

The rally was a huge success. As the four hundred demonstrators paraded, the small number of Nazi skinheads made themselves very scarce.

Then in early March the Nazis were at it again and once again they were trounced by anti-fascist demonstrators.

The Bay Area branch of the Freedom Socialist Party put out a call to form the Ad Hoc Coalition to Stop the Nazi Skinheads when they heard of plans to hold an “Aryan Woodstock” at Napa, 45 miles north of San Francisco. The Ad Hoc Coalition mobilised 800 people from both the city and the rural communities surrounding Napa around the slogan “No to racist violence! Stop the anti- labour, sexist, anti-gay, anti-Semitic neo-fascists!”

Aryan Woodstock was organised by an outfit calling themselves WAR (White Aryan Resistance), founded by Tom Metzger, former Ku Klux Klan Grand Dragon. WAR had expected 2,000 to attended their fascist rock festival but in the end only about 50 Nazi skinheads turned out and because of the counter demonstration only those with personal invitations were allowed in.

There was a large contingent of lesbians and gay men involved in the counter- demonstration. Many were from ACT-UP San Francisco and wearing *Silence = Death* T Shirts, a slogan as appropriate for fighting fascists as it is for fighting AIDS. The lesbian and gay contingent chanted “No to Hatred, No to Fear, No to Nazis, Yes to Queers!”

“These people are about hatred, violence and murder”, said to Arawn Eiblhyn, one of the ACT-UP contingent. “They are a different threat to our own right to live and survive as lesbians and gay men, as Jews, as blacks…They do not have a right to organise against our right to live and survive.”

We need to learn from both of these successful examples of united fronts. We must remember that Hitler’s movement started small. We can stop the fascist menace because at present the anti-fascists are many and the Nazis are few. What we need is unity and the will to ensure that the fascists cannot organise and grow.

Whenever fascism appears we must mobilise. We must counter its organising with swift strong united front actions to drive them off the streets. We must defend all working class and progressive events from fascist attack through forming workers defence guards.

But, as Trotsky pointed out, the germ of fascism is nurtured by capitalism and a capitalist crisis can raise fascism to epidemic proportions unless drastic countermeasures are quickly applied. The way to ultimately destroy fascism once and for all is to destroy the capitalist system in which it breeds. In the constant struggle between competing forces we must ensure that germ of fascism is extinguished permanently through the triumph of socialist feminism.

## Capitalism’s Fascist Virus Needs Working Class Antidote

## ALISON THORNE

[*Freedom Socialist Bulletin*](https://socialism.com/fsb-article/capitalisms-fascist-virus-needs-working-class-antidote/) \| WINTER/SPRING 1993 \| Issue 9

That capitalism is in bad shape is not news. What is news is the sharpened polarisation of class forces, which has the decaying system as its source.

Attacks by fascist groupings are on the rise. Anti-Semitic slogans, such as ones recently daubed on a synagogue in Brisbane and another in Perth, follow a global trend.

Dozens of Jewish-owned shops in Italy were subjected to racist graffiti the day after a mass fascist mobilisation, which attempted to recreate Mussolini’s 1922 March in Rome. In Germany, Jewish monuments at the former Sachsenhausen and Ravensbruck concentration camps have been targets of resurgent neo-Nazi assault.

People with disabilities have also been under attack. A residential institution in east Germany was firebombed, and four deaf boys were mugged by fascist activists in Halle.

The British National Party has escalated its hate campaigns and physical attacks on Black working class communities.

The fascist movement of Jean Marie Le Pen in France increased its vote at the last election. This new boldness by open fascists helps create the climate in which several racist killings of North African teenagers could occur.

In South Africa, the rightwing AWB fire bombed a gay restaurant in Johannesburg after running a vicious campaign against the venue for months.

Romani (Gypsies) are the community under attack by fascists in Hungary.

Since German reunification, 34 people have been killed in fascist attacks. The victims include immigrants, refugees, the homeless and prominent anti-fascist campaigners. Kerstin Winter, a 24-year-old lesbian rights activist and anti- Nazi organiser, was tragically murdered by fascists who sent her a splinter bomb in a parcel.

But the news isn’t all bad. This resurgence of fascist attacks is being met by an increasingly combative and well-organised anti-fascist movement. In the United States and Canada, successful united front mobilisations have got the Nazis on the run. (see Linda Averill, “Winning West Coast Strategy: Knock out the Nazis with a United Front,” *Freedom Socialist,* Volume 14 #2, April – June 1993).

Mass anti-fascist mobilisations occurred in France and in Italy, where 30,000 took to the streets in protest. Over 2 million participated in anti-fascists actions in Germany, which are increasingly mobilising and uniting trade unionists, immigrants and refugees.

**And on the home front.** The proposed visit to Australia by Nazi agitator David Irving provoked a storm of media controversy. Irving was invited to tour Australia by the League of Rights, whose founder Eric Butler, like Irving, claims the Holocaust never happened. The ultra-right League of Rights claims that its mission is to capture the minds of middle Australia.

The government took the step of denying Irving a visa. However the real target of this ban was revealed by Senator Gareth Evans, who explained that this step was necessary to prevent mass public protest, which such a visit would provoke. Evans considered this as undesirable “in the leadup to the federal election.”

Top-down attempts to ban fascist organising are totally ineffectual and will not stop the spread of fascist ideas. Such bans also set precedents, which governments will not hesitate to use against the Left when it suits them.

The government banned Irving’s visit to Australia, but now the League of Rights is promoting the sale and screening of an Irving video in an attempt to popularise his Nazi propaganda, which not very convincingly masquerades as history. Successful demonstrations against the video, called at very short notice, managed to prevent screening in most capital cities. This is an example of how we can ***start*** to build a mass movement to stop fascism.

Anti-fascist organisers in Melbourne built on the success of the anti-Irving protest, leading to larger demonstrations against a conference organised by the Citizens Electoral Council, Australian followers of U.S. fascist Lyndon LaRouche.

LaRouche, who began his political life as a member of the U.S. Socialist Workers Party in the 1940s, lost his political bearings and jumped the fence from Trotskyism to fascism because of his terminal sexism and inability to cope with the exploding second wave feminism in the ’60s (for full analysis of this phenomenon, see Clara Fraser, “LaRouche: Sex Maniac and Demagogue” in *Freedom Socialist* , Volume 9 #3, 1986).

The leader of the Australian LaRouchites, who follows his ideological guru faithfully, distinguished himself when he recently condemned feminism as a psychosis!

Several hundred turned out to protest the LaRoucheite gathering after a week- and-a-half of organising. The lesbian and gay press ran articles exposing the politics of LaRouche, the Victorian Trades Hall Council passed a resolution condemning the conference, ACT-UP held a public meeting. Radical Women’s meeting included an educational on LaRouche and his origins, and anti-LaRouche organisers gave dozens of radio interviews. Posters were pasted up, leaflets distributed and meetings held on campuses.

Predictably liberals, including Adam Carr, news editor of *Melbourne Star Observer* , bleat about the “necessity” of free speech for fascists.

Those who raise this familiar refrain as an excuse to do nothing about the growth of fascism have totally missed the plot by letting fascists organise openly and without protest.

When anti-fascists mobilise, we are simply exercising ***our*** free speech rights to demonstrate. Our aim is to build a movement powerful enough to stop fascism before it grows.

**Competing ideology.** The potential is present to build a mass fascist movement when the economy starts to crumble. The petty bourgeoisie, or middle class — small business owners, farmers, self-employed professionals and so on — provide the mass base for fascism as it is squeezed by big capital. Big capital uses the desperation this generates to turn the anger of the middle class away from the real culprit, capitalism. Instead, the petty bourgeoisie blames the working class for the desperate circumstances it experiences.

As the big bourgeoisie runs out of options to inject new life into its decrepit economic system, fascism will start to look increasingly appealing to the middle class.

Fascism is capitalism’s final solution to the problems of the 1990s. Socialism is ***our*** solution, and we must convince the petty bourgeoisie of its correctness.

It is a competition between ideas, a fight for the future. If the vision and leadership provided by socialists is not sufficiently bold, some working people will be attracted to fascism as they search for answers to their misery and despair.

We cannot be derailed from the struggle against fascism by the liberals who preach “free speech” in a vacuum.

Nor can we rely on forces of the State — like the police and immigration authorities — to stop the right wing.

The working class — women and men, queer and straight, people of all ethnic backgrounds — has the clout to stop fascism in its tracks.

We’ll do this by fighting to implement ***our*** vision — a socialist solution to the economic ruin, which feeds fascism.

## Dateline Australia: Nazi Scum on the run in Brunswick

## Alison Thorne and Peter Murray

[*Freedom Socialist*](https://socialism.com/fs-article/dateline-australia-nazi-scum-on-the-run-in-brunswick/) \| June 1994

In March, two huge rallies in a workingclass, multi-racial suburb of Melbourne thoroughly humiliated peddlers of white power ambitious to establish a base there.

A band of Hitlerites called National Action (NA) is stepping up activity in Brunswick. But when they announced a plan to rally during a multicultural street party, diverse forces came together under the banner of Brunswick Against The Nazis (BATN) to drive them out.

**Demonstrators rout fascists.** The result was stunning. Endorsements came from as far away as the Anti-Nazi League in Britain, United Front Against Fascism in the U.S., and Radical Women and the Freedom Socialist Party in the U.S. and Canada.

More than 700 people turned out to defend the street festival, and NA postponed its rally. The demonstrators, buoyed by victory, marched to the next suburb and protested outside the Citizens Electoral Council to expose its links with U.S. ultra-rightist Lyndon LaRouche.

NA held their “rally” the next weekend. Ringed by cops, they waved Australian and “white power” flags and attempted to spew out their racist, anti-immigrant, sexist, homophobic bile. Across the street a crowd gathered, chanting “Asians are welcome, Nazis are not!”

NA leader Michael Brander took the podium and tried to speak. The chant grew to a roar. Reinforcing the message of the words, people began pelting the brownshirts with eggs. Brander copped one in the face; counter-demonstrators cheered. “I thought you’d left,” said one anti-fascist. “Nah, we ran out of eggs and I went to buy some more,” her friend replied.

The anti-fascist crowd surged forward. The cops made an escape route that allowed NA to scurry up a side street. “They’re at the railway crossing! Let’s get ’em!” was heard from the anti-Nazis, who chased after their target and cornered them. NA fled town on a train commandeered by the cops.

**Liberals and ultra-leftists abstain.** The Brunswick City Council, controlled by the left faction of the Australian Labor Party (ALP), refused to endorse the organising by BATN, arguing that it “gave the fascists publicity.”

This head-in-the-sand approach is no use to the victims of Nazi thugs. The ultra-right threat is real; 20 NA goons bashed 15 people in Adelaide just days after the victory in Brunswick. To ignore the white supremacists gives a green light to their harassment and violence and allows them space to recruit.

The supposedly Trotskyist Spartacist League (SL), on the other hand, calls on paper for “mass labor/black mobilisations to crush the Nazis.” But although BATN organised endorsements from two key unions, SL refused to lift a finger, characterising BATN as “grotesque.”

Their gripe? Precisely the involvement of the established union movement! BATN asked an ALP politician and a trade union officer to speak, and it pushed individual city council members to break with the official position by endorsing the rallies. But because the ALP-dominated council is part of the government, the SL accused BATN of appealing to the state instead of organizing the masses.

The SL writes stirring phrases in its journals, but abstains from getting its hands dirty in the everyday class struggle.

Fascism’s aim is to smash workingclass organisations so that bosses can exploit workers unchecked. This is why it’s vital to mobilise trade unions in the battle to defeat Nazism.

The stance of the SL is anything but Trotskyist. In the 1930s, Leon Trotsky was the leading proponent of the united front, which brings groups with different programs together under workingclass leadership to defeat a common enemy. During fascism’s rise, Trotsky warned that the German Communist Party was making a tragic mistake by refusing to form a united front with the Social Democrats. The Communist leadership claimed that the reformism of the social democracy was as dangerous as Hitler.

The failure of the two tendencies to forge an alliance divided and immobilised Germany’s proletariat – the only force with the power to stop Nazism.

The SL, with its pose of theoretical “purity,” commits the same error.

**Capitalism needs scapegoats.** With the blessing of big business, Hitler appealed to the “little people” ruined by Germany’s economic crisis, offering them scapegoats and simple answers. Today, NA is emboldened to organise in a multi-cultural suburb like Brunswick because similar conditions exist. Brunswick has one of the highest rates of unemployment in the state. Many people are hurting, and they are looking for someone to blame.

The ALP and trade union officials peddle “improved international competitiveness” as the solution for Australian capitalism. Yet the heart of the problem is the cut-throat nature of capitalist competition itself, which forces the bosses to produce goods ever more cheaply by sacking employees and squeezing more from those who remain. Without militant leadership, insecure and impoverished workers turn upon each other.

BATN provides a model for fighting the Nazi agenda of divide and conquer. And its successes strengthen workers’ resolve to find real solutions to the poverty, misery and despair which are the sustenance of fascism.

## Lessons from the struggle: Massive community outreach was key to driving the Nazis from Fawkner

## Alison Thorne

[*Freedom Socialist Organiser*](https://socialism.com/fso-article/lessons-from-the-struggle-massive-community-outreach-was-key-to-driving-nazis-from-fawkner/) January 2019

It’s a little more than two decades since anti-fascists celebrated the closure of National Action’s (NA) organising centre in Melbourne’s outer northern suburb of Fawkner. The Tyson Street “bookshop,” actually a bunker, closed in April 1998. A 15-month campaign exposed the fascists and ensured their project was a political flop.

**A clear and present danger.** With the Eureka flag as their emblem, National Action presented themselves as Aussie nationalists standing up for the little guy. Under this surface was a militant white supremacist group formed by hardened fascists. Jim Saleam, who had joined the far right in his teens, founded NA in 1982. By the 1990s, he was jailed for attempting to murder Eddie Funde, African National Congress representative in Australia. Michael Brander, from Adelaide, became NA’s new führer. The group set about creating a climate of intimidation and fear by engaging in street violence and racist harassment, using anti-Asian graffiti, stickers and posters.

Fascism is a method of governing, which capitalism will resort to if workers’ revolt looks possible. Its main purpose is to smash progressive working class organising, particularly unions, and eradicate all democratic rights. To do this, it needs a mass movement of street thugs. Groups like NA are the embryo of this.

In 1993, NA thugs started popping up in Melbourne’s northern suburbs, harassing Asian school girls, Turkish women and tram drivers of colour. They vandalised buildings linked to anti-racist activities and carried out racially motivated attacks. Twice, the group attempted to rally in Brunswick. Thirty neo-Nazis were sent packing by a large, broad and militant community counter-rally, organised by Brunswick Against the Nazis.

When Nazis start to organise, there are those who understand that disciplined self-defence is essential. But, without fail, there are also those who want to rely on “the authorities” to keep the community safe or who naïvely counsel that the Hitlerites will disappear if we just ignore them. ALP Mayor Glenyys Romanes called upon the media “to play it all down,” as though they’re simply publicity seeking clowns. Speaking to the *Brunswick Sentinel* (“Anti-Nazi rally voices its anger”), Peter Murray, who represented the Freedom Socialist Party in the Brunswick rally organising group, answered, “That’s all very well if you’re a white Anglo councillor, but it’s not very good for the Somali woman who, a few weeks back, had her arm broken by these thugs in Northcote.” The threat was real and had to be countered with a united front of all of fascism’s targets.

**Not in our community.** Three years later, NA was back in the suburbs of Melbourne’s north with a new approach. Fawkner is a working class multicultural suburb. While the community is even more ethnically diverse today, in the ’90s there was a large Italian and Arabic population. NA’s goal in opening a headquarters was to entrench itself in the community and use a mix of nationalism and anti-Asian racism to attract and recruit unemployed youth.

Brunswick Against the Nazis re-formed as Campaign Against the Nazis (CAN). The first of five counter-rallies took place on 15 March 1997, two months after the centre opened. It mobilised more than a thousand disciplined anti-fascists, who marched through the heart of Fawkner to the centre, demanding that the Nazis leave. The rally was diverse and determined. Amongst the speakers were Ena Burstin from the Jewish Lesbian Group and an Australian Services Union official who lived in the suburb. The rally was an important show of support for the residents of Fawkner.

Despite its success, the first rally highlighted the necessity to build an ***ongoing*** anti-fascist campaign. Not only was the fascist headquarters well defended by its thugs, it was protected from the protesters by a massive show of police. The goons couldn’t easily be evicted, and a long-term campaign was needed.

There were four more anti-fascist rallies in Fawkner, the final one a year after the first. A few weeks later, the moving vans arrived, the “Closed” sign went up, and National action left the state. It was a hard-fought battle, and it ended in victory.

**Between the rallies.** Organising broad-based, disciplined counter-mobilisations to confront fascists and prevent them from building their movement is crucial. But there’s much more involved in ***cohering*** an anti-fascist movement capable of stopping them in their tracks. A key element of the campaign was educating and exposing NA and its agenda. CAN held public meetings in the suburb. A crucial initiative was the production of a multi-lingual broadsheet alerting people to the dangers of NA and the importance of standing together against them. The entire suburb was letterboxed and doorknocked. A massive 20,000 broadsheets were distributed. Amongst Fawkner’s many older Italian residents were those with a history of resisting Mussolini and first-hand knowledge of what’s at stake.

Aided by cops, Brander’s thugs could defend their base. But there was not a resident in the suburb who didn’t know that National Action was a dangerous neo-Nazi outfit. Faced with a massive educational campaign and a community against them, their shopfront became useless. The anti-fascist blitz prevented NA from attracting recruits — rendering its isolated suburban bunker a ***political*** failure.

There are many lessons from the CAN experience for the movement today. It took 15 months to evict National Action from Fawkner, but they ***were*** booted out. Achieving this goal took tenacity!

## Crush incipient fascism whatever its guise: Build the campaign to shut down the patriarchal Blackshirts!

## DEBBIE BRENNAN

[*Freedom Socialist Bulletin*](https://socialism.com/fsb-article/crush-incipient-fascism-whatever-its-guise-build-the-campaign-to-shut-down-the-patriarchal-blackshirts/) \| SUMMER/AUTUMN 2003 \| Issue 28

I remember the morning I opened up the newspaper to find a huge spread on a Christian fundamentalist “men’s rights” group calling itself the Blackshirts. I felt sick. A couple of nights earlier, a Radical Women meeting featured a talk on the Citizens Electoral Council, adherents of American fascist Lyndon LaRouche (See “LaRouche: Fascism Restyled for the New Milennium.”) Both organisations are centred in Moreland, my neighbourhood and home to a diverse, multicultural working class population.

Blackshirts leader, John Abbott, owns the Dane Centre, a well-known recording studio. The centre is close to Moreland’s thriving hub on Sydney Road, and just a couple of blocks from Solidarity Salon, organising centre for Radical Women and the Freedom Socialist Party. It’s not clear if the Blackshirts formally organise out of the centre, but the presence of Abbott is an outrage in itself.

Dressed from head to toe in black, and masked with bandanas and sunglasses, the paramilitary appearance of the Blackshirts is definitely menacing. On their sleeves is an insignia with Aboriginal boomerangs formed into an “SS.” When asked by a reporter about this hearkening back to Nazi Germany, Abbott answered point blank: “I have no problem with fascism.”

The Blackshirts regularly demonstrate outside the Family Court, calling for the repeal of Australia’s no-fault divorce laws and a penalty for “adultery.” Quoting extensively from the Bible, they regard marriage as an institution “belonging to God” and rights for women and queers an abomination. These men (there’s a token woman as well!) stalk women, who leave them (usually after years of violent abuse) and win custody of the children. Appearing outside an ex-partner’s home to proselytise their Kinder, Küche, Kirche ideology, they blitz the neighbourhood with leaflets full of vile slander, attempting to terrorise their victims and recruit like-minded brethren.

The sexist tabloid media paints these guys as a militant angry men’s group. Great for whipping up fear — and giving a platform for their fanatical views. Yes, the Blackshirts are a bunch of misogynist, homophobic bullies trying to bring back the “man’s castle.” But they didn’t appear from nowhere, and they’re not a new phenomenon. Abbott’s endorsement of fascism goes straight to the core of this deadly ideology: its hatred of women.

**Learn from history.** Today’s conditions are reminiscent of the 1920s and ’30s — economic crisis and spreading scarcity, the Federal Government’s decimation of social services and its pressure on working women to return to the home, and people’s disorientation in the chaos of capitalism in its death throes.

After 1914, Europe was in upheaval. In 1917, during World War I, the Russian workers and peasants threw out first the feudal Tsarist aristocracy and then the weak capitalist class. After the war, much of Europe was in devastating recession. In Italy, big business had been stung by the Treaty of Versailles, which formally ended the war. Its Allies, Britain, France and the U.S.A, reneged on promises of new territories. Workers were occupying the factories and tenant farmers the estates of their landlords. Desperate to thwart the rise of socialism, Italy’s leading industrialists turned to Benito Mussolini and his gangs of armed thugs, the Fasci, who roamed the country — clad in black shirts. In Germany, whose economy was destroyed by Versailles, there was a failed workers’ revolution. There too, the capitalists funded the fascists. Using anti-worker terror, mass propaganda and appeals to legitimate grievances, Hitler’s Nazi Party was elected to power, because there had been no united grassroots organising to stop it. Then followed 12 years of bloody terror. The workers’ movement was crushed and Europe was submerged in another all-out war.

One of the features of Nazism was its insistence on racial, ideological and gender conformity. Those who did not match the official profile were deemed “unfit.” And so millions of activists, Jews, ethnic minorities, queers and independent women were sent to concentration camps and either murdered or used as slave labour. In hospitals and institutions across Germany and the occupied territories, disabled people were murdered by lethal injection.

The emergence of Abbott, who has “no problem with fascism,” must be seen in this context: if the capitalist class is going to carry out this remake of society, it has to control women. We’ve always been crucial to the profit system. To survive, it needs us to reproduce the next generation, to care for it from cradle to grave and to be the workforce which sets the lowest benchmark for wages and conditions. When economic crisis tears society apart, women not only shoulder the blame, we’re given the responsibility to hold it together.

The Howard Government is not fascist, but its “family values” policies encourage the likes of Blackshirts. Fascism feeds on scarcity, and its ideas appear attractive to working people who are doing it hard. Among the Blackshirts are working men who face mandatory deductions for Child Support that seem disproportionate in comparison to their meagre take-home pay. Instead of following John Abbott, working class men should join women in a movement that opposes the privatisation of care and demands that corporate business be taxed to fund these supports. But to convince them of that requires a clear political answer to their grievances, real and perceived.

**Building community resistance.** Diversity in Safe Communities (DiSC) formed in August 2002, after the Blackshirts targeted two Brunswick women who confronted Abbott while he was being interviewed on their street by a TV crew. Assuming the women were lesbians — because they were sharing a house — Abbott threatened them with “a visit.” The Blackshirts did return with their megaphones, stuffing neighbours’ letterboxes with their homophobic poison.

The women called a meeting, which was held at Solidarity Salon. On short notice, more than 20 people from the local neighbourhood, community legal centres and socialist movement showed up and started planning a public campaign launch.

The municipality of Moreland is a tested battleground between fascists and anti-fascists. Its high unemployment and rundown services attract the likes of National Action, a Nazi group run out of town by a multi-movement campaign in 1994, the LaRouchites and now the Blackshirts. With a large population of migrants and refugees, queers and single mothers to scapegoat, they try to appeal to white folks facing hardship — so far, without success. Many residents are people who fled repression — predominantly from Italy, Turkey and Eastern Europe. The area is the base for several international Left groups. The thriving Wills branch of Socialist Alliance is in Brunswick. Multicultural working class solidarity is entrenched, and fascist ideology is just not on.

This mood was palpable at DiSC’s launch in September, which packed out Brunswick Town Hall. About 250 attended, and the atmosphere was fiery. People from all ages were there, including those with memories of life under fascism. The diverse platform of speakers included Council of Single Mothers and Their Children, a local lesbian mother and Radical Women. The meeting was receptive to this strong feminist voice and RW’s call for a united front that stands up for women’s liberation. The vote to hold a protest rally outside the Dane Centre was almost unanimous (2 against). In contrast, a motion to negotiate with the Blackshirts got an angry thumbs down. A woman speaking against it said: “There is nothing to negotiate over. I don’t want a half-racist society, and I don’t want my kids growing up in a society that is a ‘little bit’ homophobic.”

So Brunswick said: Shut down the Blackshirts. Period!

**Socialism or fascism.** DiSC provides the potential for the inclusive, broad-based and democratic campaign needed to rid the streets of the Blackshirts before they grow. History points to the urgency for the union, socialist, feminist, queer, Indigenous, refugee and anti-war movements to unite around feminist demands — such as the rights of women and all minorities to reproductive freedom, jobs and equal pay, fully-funded supports and services. Economic independence for women, whoever we are, is the bottom line if we’re to make our own choices (including the relationships we have) and claim our place in society, respected as equals and leaders. Women’s wellbeing is the measuring rod for the rest of society. Fascism would drive us all down so a few can continue to prosper. Socialism would enable us all to enjoy the collective wealth.

The capitalist system has run its course. Abbott’s gang is a symptom of how vicious things will turn if the power of the corporate world is not challenged. A decisive defeat of these 21st century blackshirt thugs would embolden and rally our side for the battles ahead.

## Stamp out fascism before it grows!

[*Freedom Socialist Organiser*](https://socialism.com/fso-article/stamp-out-fascism-before-it-grows/) \| APRIL 2015

On April 4, a group calling itself “Reclaim Australia” is planning rallies across Australia “to stop halal, sharia law and Islamisation.” In Melbourne, a Rally against Racism is being organised by socialist, anarchist and Aboriginal solidarity groups, feminists and unionists to counter-mobilise. This united front includes Radical Women and the Freedom Socialist Party.

Reclaim Australia is not only racist. It’s a dangerous nationalistic, anti-Muslim grouping with neo-Nazi ties. Its main organiser claims to be a member of the fascist Australia Defence League. It is preying on the intensifying rage of the working class 99% against the corporate 1%.

Just as Nazis in the 1930s used anti-Semitism and racism to divide and crush potential working class revolt, today’s fascists are churning up racism, xenophobia and Islamophobia to defuse the growing protest here. Through nationalistic jingoism, they speak as “patriots.”

\[Image: \]\[Image: \] New York, March 21, 2015: International Day Against Fascism and Racism in Solidarity with Greek Anti-fascists.

Fascism is a violent movement, fostered by the capitalist élite when it needs to crush potential revolution. It feeds on the fears and prejudice of those hurt by big capital but disengaged from organised workers’ struggle: small business and isolated, non-conscious workers. It then decimates the capacity of the working class to organise. It divides, and then conquers.

Leon Trotsky, leader of the 1917 Russian Revolution, put it this way regarding Germany in 1932: “Through the fascist agency, capitalism sets in motion the masses of the crazed petty bourgeoisie and the bands of declassed and demoralised lumpenproletariat—all the countless human beings whom finance capital itself has brought to desperation in a frenzy…When a state turns fascist…it means first of all for the most part that the workers’ organisations are annihilated; that the proletariat is reduced to an amorphous state; and that a system of administration is created which penetrates deeply into the masses and which serves to frustrate the independent crystallisation of the proletariat. *Therein precisely is the gist of fascism*.”

This is not happening in Australia, yet. But events in Europe, where fascism is on the rise, spell danger. In the May 2014 European Union parliamentary elections, France’s neo-Nazi National Front and England’s Independent Party (UKIP), a nationalist, anti-immigrant party, both won significant numbers of seats. Several ultra-right parties won places in the parliament for the first time. Greece’s gutted economy spurred Golden Dawn’s rise. Australia is part of the crisis-ridden global economy. The far right is already flexing its muscle, and fascist groups, like Reclaim Australia, are organising.

Meanwhile, the union movement, which still props up the Labor Party here, nurtures workers’ illusions in parliamentary solutions—keeping us demobilised and unready for the fight ahead. Trotsky warned of the ultimate consequences: “We may set it down as a historical law: fascism was able to conquer only in those countries where the conservative labour parties prevented the proletariat from utilising the revolutionary situation and seizing power.” At crucial moments in Germany, he said, “the social democracy \[akin to Australia’s Labor Party\] and the Comintern \[the Stalinists\] criminally and viciously disrupted the conquest of power and thereby placed society at an impasse. Only under these conditions and in this situation did the stormy rise of fascism and its gaining of power prove possible.”

We cannot give the ultra right and fascists a foothold. The best preventative measure right now is: organisations and individuals from the union and social movements and our communities forming a united front. Led by the working class, this coalescing of forces would uproot fascism before it can grow. This would not only build our collective strength to defeat the Abbott government’s assaults, it would prepare us for the ultimate fight to take power from the capitalists.

Right now:

*Come to the Rally against Racism on April 4* Participate in the joint contingent of the Freedom Socialist Party (FSP) and Radical Women (RW) *Contact FSP and RW for details of a united front against fascism and to work with us to defeat the far right.*

Stamp out fascism before it grows! Rally against racism, noon, Saturday 4 April, Federation Square, Melbourne.

## Melbourne, Australia — a report from the streets: Huge rally confronts fascists and explodes the myth of police neutrality

## DEBBIE BRENNAN

[*Freedom Socialist Organiser*](https://socialism.com/fso-article/melbourne-australia-a-report-from-the-streets-huge-rally-confronts-fascists-and-explodes-the-myth-of-police-neutrality/) \| OCTOBER 2015

By 7.00 am on Saturday, July 18, the Melbourne precinct surrounding Victoria’s Parliament House was under police occupation. Cops were *everywhere*. Streets were blocked off, trams and traffic diverted and the major road in front of Parliament barricaded. From 10.00 am, thousands of Melburnians were going to mobilise to stop the far-right Reclaim Australia (RA) and neo-Nazi United Patriots Front (UPF) from rallying.

\[Image: \]\[Image: \]

The cops were preparing to give the RA/UPF rally full protection from the anti-fascists. Parliament’s frontage was closed off for the fascists to rally. The street blockades were there to corral the counter-demonstrators. This was no surprise to the Campaign Against Racism and Fascism (CARF) — the coalition of socialists, including Freedom Socialist Party and Radical Women, anarchists, Aboriginal justice and other community groups, which organised the counter-rally. July 18 was CARF’s third counteraction since April. Each time, we drove out the fascists, in spite of their police protection. (See [Melbourne coalition turns out to fight fascists](https://www.socialism.com/drupal-6.8/articles/melbourne-coalition-turns-out-fight-fascists).)

Days before July 18, the mainstream media sounded an alarm — a “tip-off” that the UPF was taking weapons to the rally — with warnings to stay away. The conservative Islamic Council of Victoria, which refused to endorse the counter-demonstration, told Muslims not to attend.

\[Image: \]\[Image: \]

But people came: between two and three thousand unionists, Muslims, feminists, immigrants, refugees, LGBTIQ, First Nations, young and older people. A contingent from my union, the National Union of Workers (NUW), was there with union flags. We overwhelmed RA and UPF (half of them bussed in from Sydney) by at least 20 to 1!

CARF’s carefully planned marshalling ensured that the anti-fascist rally was disciplined and our action well informed and unified. Legal observers and medics were on hand, ready for anything.

“Anything” started before RA and UPF arrived. Police on horses charged lines of anti-fascists. Then came the pepper spray, which injured more than 100. One protester escaped the worst effects by shielding herself with an RW placard. The cops also sprayed the medics’ security area, injuring the medics who were treating the casualties. Legal observers copped police abuse, including the confiscation of a mobile phone used to record the police actions. Four from our side were arrested — one was charged with animal cruelty!

\[Image: \]\[Image: \]

The police, in fact, had found weaponry among the UPF. But their force was directed against the anti-fascists. The now iconic photo from that day — a cop and a neo-Nazi exchanging a high-five — captures the partisan stance of the State and its police force when the working class resists would-be storm troopers.

**Working class 3 – Fascists 0.** But the State couldn’t hold back another victory over the fascists. Linking arms, we formed solid barriers to stop them getting past us. Although the police escorted many through, we blocked many others. And we drowned out their speeches. “You’ll always lose in Melbourne” has become CARF’s signature chant. After five hours, RA and UPF, flanked by cops, ran away. They didn’t get to march through Melbourne. We concluded the day with a victory march through the streets.

Most important, the fascists haven’t been able to recruit. Everywhere they rallied that weekend, their turnouts were tiny. In Adelaide, Sydney, Canberra, Brisbane and Perth, for example, anti-fascists completely outnumbered them. What’s more, cities that didn’t counter-mobilise in April did so this time. Melbourne has shown others that we can and must stamp out fascism while it’s small and weak.

\[Image: \]\[Image: \]

**Upping the stakes.** What people experienced in Melbourne’s streets that day and saw on TV that night was police violence. To cover this up, the capitalist media demonised the counter-demonstrators as unruly thugs and churned out the lie: To protect society, the police had to use force against the anti-fascist “extremists,” particularly those with masks. The Police Chief Commissioner announced that he will push to ban masks and eye goggles at protests. UPF claims that the Left, which continues to organise the counter-mobilisations, is an enemy, and the State is backing that claim. It is justifying a further crackdown on the right to protest.

\[Image: \]\[Image: \]

It’s time for a united front of the whole spectrum of movements, including the union movement.

In a united front, diverse and divergent groups coalesce around agreed demands in the interest of the working class, while respecting political differences. CARF has the potential to achieve this. Under its banner, an expanding array of socialist, anarchist and community groups, unionists and activists have worked together to run the fascists out of Melbourne. Agreement on points of unity would be a powerful next step and strengthen the basis for unions and broader sections of the working class to join.

Obstacles to a united front are opportunism and sectarianism, and the Socialist Party (SP, part of the Committee for a Workers International, CWI) displays both. SP split from CARF after the successful routing of Reclaim Australia in April. The difference is over whether or not to name and confront the fascist threat. SP leads No Room for Racism, a contending organiser of the July 18 counter-mobilisation. “Contending” because SP refuses to address fascism and organises solely around Islamophobia and racism in a quest for numbers. This single-issue opportunism undermines the anti-fascist effort. SP’s sectarian hostility toward other organisations, such as CARF and its core organisations — whom they see as competitors — is another obstruction.

\[Image: \]\[Image: \]

It’s also time to draw on the international nature of this struggle. As Melbourne was rallying, thousands in Columbia, South Carolina were standing up to the Ku Klux Klan. Our fight is global.

Unions have a crucial role, and it’s no coincidence that CARF’s core organisers are rank-and-file members of a host of unions, which include the Australian Services Union, the Construction Forestry, Mining and Energy Union and the Community and Public Sector Union. Those in the NUW, including FSP and RW members, were instrumental in the union’s mobilising of a contingent. NUW members are now meeting together to deepen anti-fascist organising in the union. All this is a good start. The labour movement has the capacity to mobilise workers and the community. We need to work in our unions to get them on the streets. Imagine if all unions had mobilised for July 18 and been there. The fascists would have been crushed like an egg.

Let’s build on Melbourne’s victory and the solidarity that uplifted our spirits. And share it around!

## Campaign Against Racism and Fascism takes a bold step forward

[*Freedom Socialist Organiser*](https://socialism.com/fso-article/campaign-against-racism-and-fascism-takes-a-bold-step-forward/) \| OCTOBER 2015

\[Image: \]\[Image: \]

On 24 September 2015, the Campaign Against Racism and Fascism (CARF) officially declared itself a united front, based on eight points of unity. This was a positive development for the anti-fascist movement in Melbourne.

CARF’s statement of what it stands for is the result of eight months’ democratic collaboration among several politically diverse working class organisations committed to stopping a small core of fascists from cohering a far-right movement around Islamophobia. Through this work, socialist, anarchist, feminist and Aboriginal solidarity organisations, unionists and non-aligned individuals built a mutual trust and respect.

CARF originated in the organising that started in February to counter-mobilise against an Easter rally called by the far-right Reclaim Australia (RA). Both the Freedom Socialist Party (FSP) and Radical Women (RW) were actively involved.

Our perspective has always been that, to defeat fascism, we have to first understand it and then build a united front to stop it.

Fascism appears when capitalism is in trouble and the ruling class makes workers pay for its crisis. This is why the battle to stop fascism in its tracks is the task of the working class, in all of its diversity, and why the union movement has a critical role.

A united front is a vehicle that joins different groups in a shared class interest against a mutual foe. Hammering out points of unity as a basis for working together, combined with democracy, honesty about programmatic disagreements and respect for diversity are the keys to building the united front.

Eight months ago, there was little appetite for our orientation, but we persisted — patiently raising the need for points of unity as a pre-requisite to attract new forces and broaden CARF.

Over time, the experience of confronting the neo-Nazi RA and United Patriots Front underscored the need for an agreed perspective. The experience of working together demonstrated concretely that there was genuine agreement that enabled common action.

The task now is to use this to initiate discussions with unions, migrant community organisations, First Nations, feminist, LGBTIQ and other activist groups. All these forces are needed in CARF.

## Campaign Against Racism and Fascism Points of Unity

Campaign Against Racism and Fascism (CARF) is a united front of diverse groups and individuals. Our common aim is to prevent fascists and their far-right allies from building a fascist movement in Australia.

Our unity is based on the following points:

1.  CARF opposes racism, white supremacy, reactionary nationalism and the targeting of any people, whether for their religion, colour, sexual or gender identity or participation in organised labour. These ideologies are used to divide our communities and only help the rich and powerful. They are the breeding ground for a fascist movement.

2.  CARF declares that Australia is not the far Right’s to “reclaim.” CARF recognises that we stand on the stolen lands of Australia’s First Nations and recognises the sovereign rights of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples.

3.  CARF organises, confronts and mobilises against fascist and far-right movements to stop them organising, recruiting and spreading their violent ideology.

4.  CARF believes that when the working class — including the most oppressed and immediately targeted communities — unites and organises, we can defeat racist and fascist movements and ideologies.

5.  CARF believes that all targets of racist and fascist violence have the right to defend themselves. Our power to combat racism and fascism is through solidarity and unity in action.

6.  CARF recognises that fascists in Australia are currently attempting to mobilise under the mask of Islamophobia. CARF upholds complete freedom of conscience worldwide, and therefore sees defending the right of people to be Muslims, without discrimination or harassment, as a key part of our campaign.

7.  CARF is a democratic group that encourages internal discussion and participation in an atmosphere of respect and goodwill. We invite participation by groups and individuals on this basis.

8.  CARF recognises the right of other anti-racist and anti-fascist groups to carry out their activities, and endeavours to work together, and defend where necessary, in an atmosphere of mutual respect in the attainment of the above-mentioned points.

## Eradicate fascism through a united front: Why unions are crucial

## DEBBIE BRENNAN

[*Freedom Socialist Organiser*](https://socialism.com/fso-article/eradicate-fascism-through-a-united-front-why-unions-are-crucial/) \| JANUARY 2016

On November 28, anti-fascist action again routed neo-Nazis in Melbourne. Since April, broad community organising has repeatedly repelled the fascist United Patriots Front (UPF) and the far-right Reclaim Australia (RA) in Melbourne and Bendigo.

In late November, the UPF called all “patriots” to protest outside the Melbourne office of Victoria’s Labor Premier, Daniel Andrews. Andrews had condemned “ugly scenes” the previous weekend at an anti-Islam rally outside a mosque in Melton (Melbourne’s northwest outskirts). He said this was “not in accordance with our values,” and he called the Islamophobes “nothing but bigots.” UPF retorted: “We unlike you actually represent the working class Australian and you will see in the future our mission to protect and improve the value of the Australian worker instead of looking after foreign interest and social constructs of multi-cult, multi-faith, multi-gender, multi-multi etc…”

Campaign Against Racism and Fascism (CARF) organised the successful counteraction against UPF. The diverse working class, largely unionist, turnout outnumbered the 20 or so fascists 10-to-1 and prevented them from rallying.

\[Image: \]\[Image: \]

The UPF held this placard to the anti-fascist rally: “We are the proletariat. You are the bourgeoise (sic).” This was not a mistake: fascists appeal to workers through anti-capitalist rhetoric, portraying their opponents as the class enemy. But the real conflict is between workers and fascism.

CARF is a working class united front of socialists, feminists, anarchists, unionists and social justice activists. To Nazis, those who *organise* to stop them are the arch enemy. Another conspicuous UPF placard expressed it this way: “A chicken in every pot, an ice pick in every Trot” — referring to the murder in 1940, on Stalin’s orders, of Leon Trotsky, leader of the Russian Revolution and leading agitator for a working class-led united front against fascism. The message carries an unambiguous threat.

**Fascism explained.** Fascism’s source is capitalism, a profit-hungry system that is predatory and insatiable. The laws of capitalism are contradictory, and crisis is inherent. When the economy is in danger, it’s the exploited who pay. When the rate of profit drops toward zero, as it did after World War I, the capitalist class takes everything from the working class — brutally slashing wages and public expenditure, upping subsidies to big business, expanding armaments contracts and cutting taxes for the rich. More war and poverty.

When the capitalists did this in post-World War I Europe, the working class rebelled. Strikes spread, and Italy and Germany were hotbeds of resistance. The big industrialists relied on the state to use the iron fist. But when parliamentary governments, trying to reconcile class interests, failed, the ruling class resorted to fascism.

Fascism is a violent movement, aimed at crushing potential revolution. It feeds on the fears and prejudices of those hurt by big capital but disengaged from organised workers’ struggle: small business and isolated, non-conscious workers looking for others to blame.

Fascism’s first task is to annihilate workers’ organisations and therefore the capacity to organise. Leon Trotsky wrote about Germany in 1932: “…the proletariat is reduced to an amorphous state;…a system of administration is created which penetrates deeply into the masses and which serves to frustrate the independent crystallisation of the proletariat.”

**Fighting fascism is union business.** Today, global capitalism is in desperate crisis, and workers are paying dearly. Fascism hasn’t taken power, but a movement is growing, as events in France (where Le Pen’s National Front recently made electoral gains), Greece and other parts of Europe show. In Australia, fascist groups, such as the UPF, have appeared. Tapping into the fear-mongering fuelled by capitalism’s endless “war on terror,” seizing upon xenophobic scapegoating by successive governments and emboldened by fascist successes abroad, neo-Nazis here are trying to build a national movement.

To break the working class, fascism would smash the union movement, as it did in Italy and Germany in the 1920s and ’30s. In 1930s New South Wales, the fascist New Guard physically attacked union meetings. The union movement is where the working class is organised and holds the power to stop production.

Capitalists are always at war with organised labour. Australia’s past and present are peppered with examples: the jailing of Clarrie O’Shea, Australian Tramway and Motor Omnibus Employees Association leader, in 1969; the witchhunts against the Builders Labourers Federation, ending in its deregistration in 1986, and the Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union (CFMEU), culminating in the recent criminal charges against two top officials; threats of jail and fines against striking nurses in 2012 are just a few. Laws tightly restrict the right to strike and forbid cross-union industrial action.

In the last days of 2015, a royal commission investigating “union corruption” released its findings and recommendations. These include referring some officials for criminal prosecution (despite the lack of evidence) and state regulation of unions’ internal and financial affairs. *Members* must control their unions! To win control, they must fight for democracy. The Coalition government jumped on the released report, announcing that it will run a federal election in 2016 on industrial relations and cracking down on “union corruption.” It promises to restore the notoriously anti-union Australian Building and Construction Commission. That the report coincides with the Productivity Commission’s recommendations to take away penalty rates and conditions for low-paid workers signals a head-on assault by capital against labour.

In spite of this, the union movement is *not* beaten. Workers *want* to organise against the growing hardship and injustice. In the past year, they’ve taken over Melbourne’s streets, multiple times, to protest against austerity, Australia’s cruel refugee policies and assaults on civil liberties, to stop the forced closures of remote Aboriginal communities, to turn around climate change and more. Workers embody all the “multi’s” the UPF despises, and they’ve come out in huge numbers every time the neo-Nazis and far right have tried to rally. In CARF, unionists are core organisers.

The union movement has the capacity to mobilise workplaces and communities in greater, massive numbers. Fascism in Europe came to power in the 1920s and ’30s, because the trade unions and socialist parties refused to mobilise against the fascists while they were small. When a fascist movement grew, union and socialist movement leaders counted on the capitalist parliamentary system to stop them. The consequences were tragic. Australia’s neo-Nazis are tiny; the time to strike is now.

**Never again.** Unions have the capacity to mobilise workplaces and communities — bringing together the working class, in its enormous diversity, and crushing the fascists before they can grow.

Unionists have organised and participated in the anti-fascist counteractions from the beginning. Their tenacious building within their unions has brought some on board. The National Union of Workers (NUW) flag is a familiar sight, carried by contingents of members and delegates at every counter-rally since July. The NUW, Rail, Tram and Bus Union (RTBU), Australian Services Union (ASU), Geelong Trades Hall Council and Ballarat Trades and Labour Council supported CARF’s mobilisation against RA at Melton (part of counter-rallies across the country) with endorsements, statements and callouts to members. In Perth, the CFMEU contingent was visible with its red flags. Members and delegates of the Community and Public Sector Union lobbied CPSU leaders to endorse and build the Melton action. The union “leaders” refused (afraid to brand the union as “radical”) but the members aren’t giving up! In Queensland and the Northern Territory, the Electrical Trade Union launched its campaign against racism and fascism with a video that’s gone viral. In the NUW, members and delegates are developing materials for education throughout the union about Islamophobia and fascism.

This union support needs to broaden and deepen. In Victoria, unions joining CARF and building member involvement would strengthen the united front. Nationally, unions engaged in and leading anti-fascist organising would uproot the fascist weed wherever it sees light.

The union movement itself would become better connected and much stronger. Cross-union collaboration would arm workers, not only against the fascist threat but against the capital that drives it. This is so needed right now.

## Narre Warren: New battleground against Islamophobia and Fascism

## MICHAEL CLARK

[*Freedom Socialist Organiser*](https://socialism.com/fso-article/narre-warren-new-battleground-against-islamophobia-and-fascism/) \| JUNE 2016

In an atmosphere of Islamophobic hysteria, applications for building mosques in Australia have become a lightening rod for the far right. In Victoria it started in 2012, when the rabidly anti-Muslim, evangelical Christian Danny Nalliah railed against (but failed to prevent) a mosque being built next to his own Catch the Fire Ministries in Doveton on Melbourne’s outskirts. Nalliah claimed that mosques are breeding grounds for terrorists.

The demonising of Muslims is reminiscent of the 1950s McCarthy era. Then, it was reds under beds. Now, it’s terrorists in mosques. Either way, the persecution was and is pervasive and intense.

**Bendigo to Narre Warren.** Last year, in the Victorian rural City of Bendigo, a “Stop the Mosque” campaign — led by the likes of Bendigo Councillor Elise Chapman, now a One Nation candidate for Victoria in the upcoming federal election, and Monika Evers, a high-ranking functionary of Reclaim Australia — fought to block an application from the local Muslim community. The neo-Nazi United Patriots Front (UPF), looking for opportunities to recruit and set down roots, got involved. On this occasion, they met strong, unified resistance from anti-racist and anti-fascist campaigners, including local Muslims. The mosque won approval. But the fight against Islamophobia and the fascist menace is not over.

Now the battle has moved to Narre Warren in Melbourne’s southeast, where the Saarban Islamic Trust, representing the largely Urdu-speaking Muslim population, applied to build a Masjid (place of worship). Narre Warren is part of the City of Casey, home to around 14,000 Muslims. The nearest mosque has a capacity of 345 worshippers. None in the entire area speaks Urdu.

The mosque proposal promptly drew out the far right and fascists. Nalliah’s Rise Up Australia Party (RUAP) and the UPF began counter-organising. Casey Councillor, and now RUAP’s Senate candidate in the federal election, Rosalie Crestani, garnered objections to the application. Crestani had previously teamed up with then councillor, now Mayor of Casey, Sam Aziz, to work to stop an application for a new mosque in Doveton. Not coincidentally, the proposed site was next to the proposed site for Danny Nalliah’s new church. They failed.

In February, a new “Stop the Mosque in Narre Warren” group launched its facebook page. The following month, UPF rolled up at a community forum, at which its leader, Blair Cottrell, spoke. Cottrell, who believes Adolph Hitler’s picture should be in every kindergarten and school, sees UPF’s anti-Islam campaign as a first step toward tackling “the Jewish question.”

On April 26th, at a strictly controlled public meeting, Casey Council rejected the mosque application. Of the 1,000 objections submitted, most had come from elsewhere in Australia — some as far away as Northern Territory. Mayor Sam Aziz vowed to use all council resources necessary to defend the decision. You would think that if the issue were just about planning, the council would ask the Saarban Trust to work on their proposal and come back for a new appraisal. Not so for Mayor Aziz and his off-sider Crestani.

The links between the far right and government become murky here. Aziz’s political ties are unsavoury. Amongst his facebook friends are:

-   Kim Vuga, who gained infamy as a diehard Islamophobe on SBS TV’s *Go back to where you came from* , about attitudes on immigration. She now leads a party called Love Australia or Leave, with slogans like “Say no to Islamic immigration.”

-   Brian Woods, a candidate for the rightwing Palmer United Party in the last election, but better known for his recent Facebook post: “Domestic violence is solely a woman’s choice.”

Those supporting Mayor Aziz’s actions include UPF’s Chris Shortis, who ascribes to a Nazi-like white supremacist Christianity. Other backers recommend that Aziz run as a candidate for the far-right anti-Muslim Australian Liberty Alliance in this federal election.

**Not just a local fight.** This pattern of far-right and fascist groups campaigning to defeat mosque applications has been repeated around the country. They seize upon Islamophobia to build their numbers and visibility. I recently spoke with Ahmed from Islamophobia Watch, an organisation that monitors and reports acts of violence and discrimination against Muslims in Australia. He explains that the far right uses a template of racism for mosque applications, irrespective of the site. These events act like a beacon for mobilising. They’re also a bright green light for violence and vandalism, which are escalating — such as assaults on Muslim women, the desecration of a prayer room at Sydney University and the depositing of pigs’ heads in front of mosques. In Narre Warren there was, what appears to be, an arson attack on the proposed mosque site. The president and secretary of the Saarban Islamic Trust have received anonymous threatening phone calls.

**United community fightback.** Bendigoans, chiefly organised by the Bendigo Action Collective, called on Melburnians and other Victorians to counter the fascists in their city. Freedom Socialist Party (FSP) and Radical Women (RW) have been part of these large mobilisations. In Narre Warren, Casey Against Racism (CAR) formed from a meeting between Muslims and other anti-racist, anti-fascist campaigners from the local and wider Melbourne community.

On the night that Casey Council voted to reject the mosque application, hundreds rallied with the Muslim community. Entry into this public meeting was tightly restricted, and so a vocal majority outside held placards and chanted in support of local Muslims and their right to a place of worship. This powerful show of solidarity could become a formidable counterforce against the Islamophobic onslaught.

**Victory through a united front.** Fascists and the far right see these anti-mosque campaigns as fertile ground for growing a movement founded on white, male-supremacist nationalism. In a world being ransacked and wrecked by profit interests, they speak to the fears of people who are ready for scapegoats. Islamophobia is a ready-made answer, used for decades by governments to explain the endless wars abroad and assaults on jobs, security and rights at home. LGBTIQ people, immigrants, First Nations, women, unions and radicals are also vilified and blamed for the mounting economic and social distress.

Campaign Against Racism and Fascism (CARF) has counter-mobilised against this danger since Reclaim Australia appeared in Melbourne in April 2015. Formed by diverse groups including FSP and RW, unionists and social justice activists, CARF organises around an agreed set of principles. One is to defend people’s freedom of conscience, including the right to be Muslim, without discrimination or harassment. Another is to confront fascists and the far right to stop them from recruiting and growing. From Melbourne’s Federation Square to Richmond and Coburg, Bendigo and Melton to Narre Warren, CARF has been instrumental in pushing back an emerging neo-Nazi movement.

At a recent CAR meeting, I asked Inaz, a young Muslim woman, why she’s involved. She said, “I want to make sure that the future generations are a more cohesive and united community — it doesn’t matter where you come from or what your beliefs are — so that my children and everyone else’s children can grow up in a better community where everyone’s welcome.”

This community is possible. When all who are targeted unite as a cohesive front, we can overpower the fascist stormtroopers and far right bigots. We can repair the environment with our solidarity.

## Police Give Fascists State Protection

\[Image: \]\[Image: \] Police stop and search intimidation tactics did not work. Anti-fascists complied when they had to and went back to demonstrating.

On June 25, about 100 “patriots” showed up to march for “Australian Pride.” They were met by a 250-strong “No Pride in Hate” — LGBTIQ, diverse genders, First Nations, multiple ethnicities and races mobilised by Campaign Against Racism and Fascism (CARF) and No Room for Racism. Our side stood out with rainbow flags, placards and banners, hats and jackets displaying different union emblems and loud chanting.

For the fascists, the Australian Pride March was an attempt to bring together their splintered grouplets: two years of constant hammering by CARF’s counter-mobilisations have left them weak and demoralised. On the day, they were despondent that more “patriots” hadn’t turned up. On the anti-fascist side, the expanding solidarity among those targeted by the neo-Nazis was uplifting.

**Police protect fascists.** We could have stopped the fascists then and there, if not for the hundreds of cops deployed — including riot and mounted police — to facilitate the fascist march. Victoria Police designated most of Melbourne as a stop-and-search zone to use its sweeping powers against the anti-fascists. They kept us at a distance to let the fascists march one block to Parliament House. When some from our side broke through the police lines and arrived before the fascists, police forcibly removed them. The police then isolated and surrounded us. They repeatedly pepper sprayed — and threatened to arrest people helping the victims, who were badly affected.

Unintimidated, we drowned out the fascists, who had dwindled to 30, and forced them to retreat back the way they came, under police escort. We then marched through the city’s streets.

The police role was decisive. Fascists were able to rally at Parliament House. After the rally, a group of fascists marched through parts of Melbourne. The anti-fascist united front needs to grow and prepare for neo-Nazis operating under State protection.

**Today’s stormtroopers.** Neo-Nazis are coming out in the open about their multi-issue agenda. Until now, Islamophobia has been their chief recruiting card, using Muslims as the scapegoat for the growing insecurity of people hurt by decades of neoliberalism. In promoting the June 25 action, they disclosed other targets: LGBTIQ, especially trans folk, the African community, immigrants and refugees, and the Left.

To promote their march on June 25, the fascists deliberately misappropriated Pride, the annual international LGBTIQ celebration in June. “Gender-bending indoctrination” of our children, they said, is destroying our society. They singled out the highly successful anti-bullying Safe Schools program, a lifeline for trans and other LGBTIQ kids, to throw on their Nazi bonfire.

Enforcement of strict binary roles go hand in hand with a gender hierarchy (i.e. male supremacy). If the closet is a prison for LGBTIQ folks, the domesticated home is a hellhole for women. If they could, the fascists would up-end 50 years of progress by the women’s and queer liberation movements.

Problems caused by immigration are many, according to these Aussie Pride goose-steppers. It’s responsible for everything from rising unemployment and house prices to our clogged roads and public health system. Not only that, any retreat on Australia’s infamously brutal refugee policy would “return people smuggler boats to our shores and further threaten our national security.”

The neo-Nazis are also going after the African community — exploiting police-fuelled propaganda about “African crime gangs,” which the mainstream media then pumps out ad nauseum.

But it’s the Left that fascists hold ultimately responsible. “Political correctness,” they claim, is destabilising Australia’s “morals and values.” Truth is, neo-Nazis hate the Left’s unrelenting counter-organising. In November, when CARF trounced a fascist rally celebrating Trump’s election, the Australian Alternative Right posted on Facebook: “The ‘far left’ protest cult are loud, they’re out there in big numbers every week, demanding their voice be heard…” This is what the Hitlerites tried to turn around on June 25.

\[Image: \]\[Image: \] Victoria Police rolled out the red carpet to assist the small group of Nazis to rally at Parliament.

**Not operating in a vacuum.** Parts of the neo-Nazi world are connected with people in respectable places. Leaders of the Party for Freedom (PFF) and United Patriots Front (UPF), for example, have been photographed with Senator and One Nation leader Pauline Hanson. The PFF, UPF and True Blue Crew have promoted her meetings and publicly aligned with her electoral campaign. The UPF offered to be her bodyguard.

Neo-Nazis share views with Hanson, South Australian Senator Corey Bernardi, Queensland MP George Christensen and the parliamentary far Right overall. Virulent racism, xenophobia and Islamophobia provide a lot of ideological common ground for fascists and far-right parliamentarians. So do “traditional family values.” Bernardi, for instance, says marriage equality leads to “polygamy and bestiality.” He denounces Safe Schools as a program for “paedophile grooming.” Hanson and Bernardi viciously attack mothers on welfare and single mothers in general as immoral and unfit.

Behind these assaults is nationalism: those who subvert “Australian morals and values” are enemies of the nation. This reasoning is not confined to far-right and fascist ideologues. Arguing the Coalition’s push for an even harder citizenship test, Prime Minister Turnbull announced that new citizens should be *“patriots, committed to the values that define us.”* UPF führer, Blair Cottrell, couldn’t have put it better. And not a day passes without “terrorism” jumping from the news reports and commentary.

White Australia ideology and the lie that no society existed in Australia before European “settlement” still thrive in Parliament. So do the Islamophobic, xenophobic, homophobic, sexist, anti-poor, anti-worker politics of those serving big capital.

**Nationalism: rescue remedy for the status quo.** The deepening global economic crisis is spreading misery and desperation for most people. The basics for survival — welfare, public education and healthcare, jobs and working conditions — are being gutted. Life for workers (employed or not), the self-employed and people running small businesses becomes more precarious by the day. People are demanding solutions.

Protests are more frequent. And they’re getting bigger — such as Melbourne’s 60,000-strong First Nations-led Invasion Day march on January 26 this year, which overwhelmed the annual Australia Day parade and stopped city traffic for hours. Protests are also becoming more internationally connected, such as the huge Women’s Marches in solidarity with those in the U.S. protesting Trump’s inauguration. Melbourne’s recent demonstration of 30,000 construction unionists against cuts to penalty rates and the anti-union Australian Building and Construction Commission showed how powerful the movement could be if *all* unions came out.

\[Image: \]\[Image: \] \[Image: \]\[Image: \] Those countering the Nazis in Melbourne on 25 June were diverse, passionate, determined and disciplined.

*This* scares the capitalists. Bourgeois politicians’ answer is nationalism. “Grow the economy” for Australians (read: stabilise profit for the 1%), said Turnbull when he spruiked the May Budget. The budget actually took away from those at the bottom while giving tax cuts to the rich. Law-and-order measures, such as Victoria’s criminalisation of face coverings at demonstrations, are for “Australians’ protection.” The intended meaning is that Left “extremists” and “criminal African gangs” are a threat to the community. And problems such as unaffordable housing are blamed on foreigners, specifically Chinese. Scapegoating doesn’t come from Hanson alone. It comes from Turnbull’s Liberal Party and Bill Shorten’s Labor Party, and it’s embedded in the mainstream media narrative.

Turnbull, Shorten, Hanson et al are working hard to deflect mounting anger in the working and middle classes away from the system by setting up straw enemies. Nationalism bonds workers to their bosses, while scapegoating breaks class solidarity. Through divide-and-control, these parliamentary representatives of capital help the fascists and embolden them. But *this does not make them fascist* — not unless they set about building a movement that sets out to crush the working class. This is fascism.

Fascism is based in the middle class, which has no power of its own. At the critical point of class conflict, if the working class is divided and vulnerable, this class in the middle will side with capital against workers. The capitalist class then goes about brutally destroying unions and the Left, thus destroying workers’ capacity to organise. Fascism is capitalism’s last resort to save itself.

**Build the united front.** The neo-Nazis’ hit list doesn’t stop at the June 25 targets. Fascism’s agenda is as broad as the working class is diverse. Now, fascists are profiling workers — Muslims, women, LGBTIQ people, First Nations, immigrants, refugees, people of colour, socialists and anarchists. Soon, they’ll go after their unions, where workers organise.

CARF is a united front of socialists, anarchists, Aboriginal justice activists, feminists and unionists, based on agreed Points of Unity. Freedom Socialist Party and Radical Women helped found CARF more than two years ago, when socialists, anarchists and community activists came together to counter-organise against Reclaim Australia, then an emerging far-right movement.

The June 25 counter-action brought in new people, and CARF can build beyond a predominantly left front. The day’s events showed how necessary this is. **Everyone** in the fascists’ sights — **especially unions** — should join and strengthen this crucial united front for the fight ahead. If you want to work with FSP and RW to do this, contact us!

## Popular opposition grows to “Australia Day”

**ALISON THORNE**, [*Freedom Socialist Organiser*](https://socialism.com/fso-article/popular-opposition-grows-australia-day/)\| JANUARY 2018

Protesting Australia Day has a long and proud history. Aboriginal people and their supporters have been resisting since this day of national celebration started on 26 January 1935 to mark the anniversary of the arrival of the First Fleet into Port Jackson in 1788. The colonisers did not settle an empty land. They invaded a continent that was home to more than 500 nations. For Aboriginal people, this began a genocidal war against the oldest culture on earth.

**Escalating opposition.** In 1938, pioneering Aboriginal activists challenged the official sesquicentenary party by holding a Day of Mourning to demand equality. On the Australia Day bicentenary in 1988, more than 40,000 joined a multiracial march through central Sydney, led by 15,000 Aboriginal people from across the country.

The term “Invasion Day” is now used widely. In 2017, 50,000 people blocked central Melbourne, outnumbering those taking part in the earlier Australia Day parade. A.B. Original’s catchy protest song, *January 26* , came in 16th on the Triple J Hottest 100 annual music listener poll. And in 2018, the radio station will move the countdown from Australia Day to the fourth Saturday of the month, responding to clear messages from listeners and the music industry. In its announcement, the ABC station said it was “heavily involved in the growing dialogue around Indigenous recognition and perspectives on 26 January.”

In 2016 Freemantle Council cancelled Australia Day activities, instead holding a multicultural event later in the month called *One Day in Freo*. This began a movement, with Darebin, Moreland and Yarra Councils in Melbourne and Hobart Council in Tasmania coming on board.

**Nazis, draped in the national flag.** The Turnbull government swiftly retaliated, withdrawing these Councils’ right to hold their annual citizenship ceremonies.

The Councils also attracted the wrath of neo-Nazis — or patriots, as they call themselves. Fascists fan fears around issues as diverse as a mosque in Bendigo, same-sex marriage equality, youth crime, settling refugees or family law recognising the rights of women in attempts to attract people on a particular issue and draw them into the far-right movement. Wrapped in the Australian flag and posing as defenders of the Aussie BBQ, they’ve mounted an attack on the growing movement to dump Australia Day.

Led by Neil Erikson, the Party for Freedom has disrupted Council meetings. On 27 September, they barged into a public hearing conducted by Moreland Council. Their placard saying “Communist council beheads Australia Day” made it clear they see the Left as their arch enemy. Erikson and his mates were surprised to find anti-fascists from the Freedom Socialist Party, Radical Women and the Indigenous Social Justice Association – Melbourne amongst the community groups. FSP, RW and ISJA, which have faced off Erikson many times as part of Campaign Against Racism and Fascism (CARF), were there to testify in support of the Free Speech Moreland Campaign against undemocratic changes to local laws. They led chants of “No-Nazis, Never Again” and “Always was, always will be Aboriginal land.” The disrupters failed to intimidate.

When faced with the threat of a second visit from the neo-Nazis, Yarra Council showed how to deal with them. Socialist councilor, Stephen Jolly, approached CARF and No Room for Racism to mobilise a defence. Up against a disciplined and unified counter-mobilisation, the fascists backed off.

**Not just the date.** The outpouring of solidarity with Indigenous Australia and the growing recognition that 26 January is a day of mourning, not something to celebrate, is inspiring. But solidarity between First Nations people and multicultural Australia requires more than a change of date. Besides its genocidal racism, Australia Day promotes reactionary nationalism — the idea that we, whose wages and lands are stolen, have common cause with the thieves in control, not with the exploited and oppressed in other countries.

The truth is different. Australia is a society built on the stolen lands of the First Nations. It is also built on the shameful legacy of the White Australia policy. And it is a society divided by class — haves versus have-nots. The flag waving, jingoism and parades are designed to make working people believe in a mythical national interest, based on the lie that we’re all in it together. The blossoming of solidarity between First Nations people and Australians from all backgrounds is abhorrent to neo-Nazis — and to the representatives of big capital, who will back these forces when bourgeois democracy can no longer hold down people conscious of our common interests and ready to bring this brutal system down.

## Dateline Australia: Neo-fascist hustler Yiannopoulous bashes feminism

**Debbie Brennan**\ [*Freedom Socialist*](https://socialism.com/fs-article/neo-fascist-hustler-yiannopoulos-bashes-feminism/) \| February 2018

“Feminism is cancer,” spews provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos. His anti-women stance and white supremacist, anti-Muslim, far-right politics explain his rude welcome in Melbourne’s inner suburb of Flemington on Dec. 4, 2017. He and supporters were drowned out by hundreds of anti-fascists — on just an hour’s notice since the meeting place was secret.

That counter demonstration was organised by the Campaign against Racism and Fascism (CARF), and joined by other social justice activists and numerous refugee and immigrant residents of Flemington Estate. Nazi agitators taunted and attacked refugees and protesters. The Victoria state police mobilised hundreds of cops who used pepper spray and hurled racist abuse at the anti-Nazis.

Thirteen days later, in response to the vicious police tactics, the Freedom Socialist Party, Radical Women and the Indigenous Social Justice Association of Melbourne all mobilised to support the “Black Lives Matter: No Racism, No Far Right, No Police Violence in Flemington.” There in solidarity were Aboriginal activists, the local community legal centre, the Islamic Council of Victoria, public housing advocates, the local member of parliament from the Greens, and unionists from the Australian Education Union.

Yiannopoulos’ national speaking tour, fittingly organised by the British porn magazine *Penthouse*, was designed to galvanise Australia’s fragmented ultra-right forces. The tour was greatly helped by a fawning media and adoring politicians, who hosted a speaking gig at Parliament House!

Yiannopoulos, himself a multi-millionaire, speaks for the 1 percent, who reign over economic conditions evermore brutal for the rest of society. Closely allied with wealthy white nationalists, he tours the world to win over people who are fearful for the future and demanding answers, especially the young. His bigoted platform offers them scapegoats to blame and a movement to act out their grievances.

**Mr. Misogyny.** Yiannopoulos directs his most venomous arguments against feminism. Society as we know it will die, he declares, if feminism is not removed. Why? Because he thinks sexual harassment and rape are feminist inventions that make victims of innocent men. Feminism has made relationships just too risky.

Feminism has also upset reproduction, he warns. In keeping with his white supremacy, he claims birth control has dangerously caused the “collapsing birth rate” of white women. “Pathetic, unlovable” male feminists contribute to this crisis, because they give in to their partners and thereby forsake their own procreative responsibility.

Milo’s homophobia (which includes denouncing his own homosexuality) and his transphobia are just as malicious. He dishonors both as social sicknesses and defends capitalism’s wellspring of labour and profit — the traditional family.

Absurdly, the gender gap is another feminist myth, says he. Women are quite *free* to study what they want, but they gravitate toward the lower-paid, “female” occupations *by choice*.

**Far right’s nightmare.** Yiannopoulos warns that feminism is “a very communist set of ideals, which is why you see a big crossover between feminism and Marxism.” Bella d’Abrera, from the conservative Institute of Public Affairs, echoes this blatant redbaiting: “Students are being shamelessly indoctrinated into neo-Marxist beliefs … and by the time they graduate, they are fully fledged justice warriors.” Bettina Arndt, men’s rights advocate and newspaper columnist, laments, “What was most striking about the leftist crowd demonstrating \[in Melbourne\] were the large numbers of earnest, fresh-faced young women holding up posters that made their sentiments very clear.”

In the real world, this author and frequent protester must clarify. Feminism is the theory and practice of political, economic and social equality among genders. Marxism is the theory and practice that the struggle between the haves and have-nots in society is a major force in history. It organizes toward a classless, socialist society as the fairest, most productive, and most satisfying.

Yiannopoulos and his admirers, therefore, should be afraid. Marxism and feminism are indeed interconnected. And women are on the move, especially since Trump’s inauguration as U.S. President, the relentless gender pay gap, concentrated attacks on abortion rights, and now, the explosively unmasked sexual assault crimes. Women will be equal when private property and classes no longer exist. And young women today are driving the march for equality leftwards, toward revolution.

**Feminism unites.** Yiannopoulos hates feminism because it doesn’t divide his enemies — it combines them. Those protesting in Melbourne were all colours, refugee, immigrant and Australian born. They spanned sexualities and genders. They were students and unionists. Crossing generations, their energy and experience worked together. Their signs and chants denounced everything Yiannopoulos represents.

This is logical, of course. Women and children are 80 percent of the world’s refugees. Aboriginal women are 30 percent of Australia’s national female prison population, and their children are 14 percent more likely than non-Aboriginal kids to be imprisoned. Homophobia and transphobia drive young lesbians and trans women out of home. Suicide among LGBTIQ people is much higher than the general population. Homelessness is a growing reality for women in general, and domestic violence is the principal cause. Shocking percentages of women are sexually abused at work, 89 percent in hospitality jobs alone. Education, health and basic daily essentials disappear. Women shoulder the services lost through government cuts.

In the words of Black American feminist, bell hooks, “Feminism is for everybody.” When women rise up, they lift everyone — their households, workplaces, communities and all of society. The closer to the bottom, the greater the rise. Because the goal is equality.

Feminism can cure society of the real cancer — oppression, by removing its cause — capitalism. And the sooner, the better.

## PUSH! Organising and educating to build a united front against fascism

### A call out to unite fascists and the far right

In Australia and around the world, we face a fascist threat. Nazis are returning to the streets of towns and cities, winning seats in parliaments across Europe and — closer to home — marching openly under police protection through the streets of Melbourne. Wherever they appear, fascists spell danger, with local groups such as Blair Cottrell’s Lads Society training for combat and Neil Erickson’s Cooks Convicts raiding local councils and intimidating immigrants and refugees.

While these developments do not mean we are in a fascist state, they are warnings. Fascists rely on enablers and collaborators in the political mainstream to give them a platform. The current wave of fascism is no different. From Israel’s Netanyahu and the Philippines’ Duterte to the USA’s Trump, far right governments light the way for these emerging fascists. So do fear-mongering mainstream “democrats,” from Malcolm Turnbull and Matthew Guy to Daniel Andrews.

\[Image: \] *Campaigning at the Chelsea Manning event: PUSH! strives to build a united resistance to the far right, mobilising all of the targets of fascism. Photo by Alison Thorne.*

## Racism lays the foundation for fascism

Australia is a state founded on the theft of Aboriginal land, the denial of the sovereignty of the people who have been living here for tens of thousands of years, and genocide to wipe out their communal culture. The capitalists need to propagate racism and reactionary nationalism to validate their position and pit workers against each other. Official state racism provides the environment where fascists are encouraged to organise.

Through rallies, elections, social media and think-tanks, fascists seek platforms to recruit from and normalise their world view, more broadly co-opting conservative or moderate forces toward their agenda. Following the examples of Hitler and Mussolini, they aim to build a movement capable of lifting them, and their ideological program, into state power. This is fascism — a mass movement, whose social base is mainly small business operators and entrepreneurs (the middle class) but also workers devoid of class solidarity, desperately looking for a solution to their impoverishment and uncertain futures.

## Without capitalism, there would be no fascism.

Fascist ideologues feed on their fears and prejudices, harkening to a mythical bygone era of greatness steeped in reactionary nationalism, white pride and patriarchal family values. Exploiting deep-seated and systemic racism, sexism, homophobia and xenophobia, they offer up scapegoats to blame — Muslims and Jews, immigrants and refugees, people of colour, First Nations, women, disabled people and the LGBTIQ community. However their prime marks are trade unions and the Left, because these are the movements capable of uniting and mobilising their targets against them.

Scapegoating deflects attention from the source of ever-widening desperation: the profit system. When economic crisis becomes so critical that workers and the oppressed resist and parliamentary democracy can no longer keep the class “peace,” the billionaire class will turn to the fascists. This happened 80 years ago. This economic élite will resort to fascism again to stave off revolt and save itself. The aim is to crush the working class so that capitalism can survive.

## We can stop this

Hitler himself said that organised resistance could have eliminated the Nazis when they were still small and weak. But the fragmented labour and Left movements failed to coalesce into a united front. Fascism beat the working class into submission — assassinating its leaders, sending millions into concentration camps and forced labour, enforcing “kinder, küche, kirsche” (children, kitchen, church) on women of the “master race,” and smashing trade unions.

Unity in action is our collective, mutual defence. All of fascists’ targets coming together as organisations and individuals is our weapon against aspiring führers while they’re still small, split and weak. And while we still have rights to organise.

## The united front is our collective defence

Our vision is of a united front in which politically divergent groups and individuals cohere around points of agreement and work together respectfully, collaboratively and uncompromisingly in the interest of workers and all the oppressed. A united front is about marching with our own banners and slogans, and striking together.

Democracy and accountability are key to this united strength. Without them, a united front can’t build or last.

Crucial to the united front is the involvement of the union movement, because this is where workers organise and build collective self-discipline to act in defence of our class. Union officials are belatedly beginning to recognise the threat. But it is the members and delegates — the ones facing fascist targeting in their everyday lives — who are most compelled to push our unions to join.

## PUSH! Organising and Educating to Build an Anti-Fascist United Front

PUSH! is a newly formed group committed to working with all other anti-fascists fighting to defeat this threat. Our member organisations — Freedom Socialist Party, Indigenous Social Justice Association – Melbourne, Melbourne Anarchist Communist Group and Radical Women — have long histories of anti-fascist organising, from running National Action out of Brunswick and later Fawkner and ridding Victoria of the misogynist, homophobic Blackshirts, to fighting off the current fascist scourge as founding members of Campaign Against Racism and Fascism.

This is a callout to all organisations and individuals who want to join in democratically shaping the agreed principles of unity and direction for a collective, united push to remove the fascist threat and make our communities and movements truly safe.

## Beware — fascists are organising

Australia has become a popular destination for far-right wannabe demagogues on speaking tours. From openly misogynist, homophobic, transphobic, racist Milo Yiannopolous and Lauren Southern to reactionary nationalists Nigel Farage and Steve Bannon, each comes with their special brand of snake oil. Rightwing politicians and commentators fawn over them, media give them airplay, local fascists come out for them and police use brutal force against the protests. This parade of visitors is an ominous sign of a well-resourced far right attempting to cohere a global following. It makes a favourable environment for fascists.

The re-emergence of open fascist gatherings began in early 2015, when the far-right Reclaim Australia tried to establish a movement. Three-and-a-half years later, Reclaim Australia has gone quiet. However hard-right and fascist groups came out of this incipient movement or have formed since, and they ***are*** organising.

Though splintered and weak, these neo-Nazis are active and preparing for an imagined day of glory. Groups like the Lads Society and Antipodean Resistance train for combat. They’ve attacked anti-fascists, disrupted solidarity rallies for refugees and Palestinians and raided local councils supporting First Nations’ demands to dump January 26 as the date for “Australia Day” celebrations. They organise and support each others’ rallies, like True Blue Crew’s Australia Pride March. They even act as security for international visitors, such as Lauren Southern and Stefan Molyneux.

Consistent anti-fascist organising has kept them small and fragmented. But Trump and his global cohorts pump their adrenalin, boost their confidence and give them a voice. And they enjoy police protection.

The visit of neo-Nazi Gavin McInnes, founder of the Proud Boys, in November is sure to excite the local führers.

**A world destabilised.** The aim of the über-right and fascists is to win over angry people terrified about the future. They offer scapegoats to blame and the fairy tale of a once white and great nation to “reclaim.” Their purpose is to direct anger away from the real problem, the capitalist system. They act as a smokescreen for a ruling class very nervous about working class rage turning into revolt.

Here’s what people are not supposed to see: The market economy is disintegrating. The cause is its inbuilt contradictions — the most fundamental being, as the Communist Manifesto puts it, “the revolt of modern productive forces against modern conditions of production.” Booms crash under the weight of overproduction — too many goods and not enough consumers —, followed by recession and depression. Each debilitating bust leaves capitalism weaker. The 2007 Global Financial Crisis (GFC) was the longest and worst since the 1930s Depression, and the system isn’t recovering.

For a generation accustomed to some certainty, the instability is baffling and scary. Older Australians recall a time when most had secure work and a roof over their heads. Government payments, when unemployed or incapacitated, were considered a right. From the early 1970s, healthcare and education were free. Public funding sustained many public and community services, from free, efficient provision of water, electricity, gas and emergency services to programs for mothers and people with special needs. These were won through union-led struggle.

**Wealth transfusion.** But when profit rates plummet, as they have over decades, capitalists take it all back. Neoliberalism is about siphoning public money into private coffers — government bailouts, privatisation, tax cuts and loopholes, and so forth.

It’s theft, and it started well before Generations Y and Z were born. So their life experiences and expectations are grimly different. According to the Deloitte 2017 Millennial Survey, underemployment is the highest in 40 years. One-third of young people are jobless or underemployed. The Centrelink regime makes survival a daily hell. Eighty percent expect to never own a home. But an investment-driven housing market — which keeps rents high and tenancy insecure — makes renting a perpetual nightmare. The social consequences of these statistics are far-reaching and staggering. BeyondBlue reports, for example, that one in seven young Australians experience a mental health condition and one in fourteen an anxiety disorder.

The older generation is suffering, too. Single women over 55 are the fastest growing group facing homelessness. Discrimination in the labour market, which includes inequality in pay and superannuation entitlements, no retirement savings and ineligibility for the age pension are forcing more women, aged 55 – 65, onto the streets. Despite, Prime Minister Morrison’s assurance that the pension age won’t be raised to 70, it has already gone up to 67. There is absolutely no guarantee that people will be spared a lengthened working life, either in very insecure work or on Newstart.

The struggle to cope with the ever-rising costs of essentials — from food and heating to healthcare and education — crosses generations. And just as workers are losing their livelihoods, so is the middle class (small business). Go through any town or suburb, and empty shops are everywhere.

The result? Oxfam recently revealed that 82% of the world’s wealth created in 2017 went to the richest 1%; the poorest half got nothing. Since 2008, billionaires in Australia have multiplied from 14 to 33 — including 8 just last year! Inequality today is worse than it has ever been.

**Hanging onto power.** Eighty years ago, German and Italian capitalism was reeling from World War I. Workers in heavy industry were striking and peasants were occupying large estates, forcing major concessions from big business and landowners. Big capital could no longer rely on parliamentary democracy to restore the “peace.” The capitalist class was divided on how to deal with it. Heavy industry (mining, iron and steel) and the bankers backing it were most acutely hit by the revolts. They chose to finance fascist street gangs — Hitler’s Brownshirts and Mussolini’s Blackshirts — to bring the rebellious workers back into line.

This isn’t the situation yet in Australia, the U.S. or Europe. But the working class across these countries is becoming more desperate and angry. So too is the middle class. But, unlike workers, this class in the middle does not have the autonomous power to take on the 1%. It will jump to whichever side looks stronger.

Workers are still restrained by the belief that parliamentary democracy can make the system “fair again” — a delusion fuelled by the trade union movement’s Labor-aligned officialdom. But it’s increasingly fragile, and one day it will burst. The 120,000 fed-up unionists whose march shut down Melbourne last May made this apparent. The organisers tried to orchestrate an electoral cry for Labor, but the voices were half-hearted. Many placards demanded the right to strike. “Union Power!” could be heard throughout the city.

## Fascist versus far-right. Far-right ideologues, like Nigel Farage (ex-leader of the UK Independent Party, UKIP), Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton and One Nation Senator Pauline Hanson, play on people’s fears, especially those of the middle class. Their xenophobic, racist scapegoating of Muslims and immigrants of colour whips up violent bigotry and legitimises fascist ideas, thus sewing seeds for a fascist movement. But does this make them fascist? *No.*

In its 2016 political resolution, *Standing on the Edge of Something Big*, the Freedom Socialist Party characterises fascism as more than a vicious ideology: “Fascism arises when capitalists fear that revolution is on the horizon and they have no alternative but to turn to a jackbooted mass movement, with the \[middle class\] in the front lines. The purpose of this movement is to spearhead a political counterrevolution, to crush any and all working class activism and organisations and ultimately all democratic institutions.”

Farage, Dutton, Hansen and even their hero Donald Trump are agents of capitalist business as usual: there’s not yet an impending revolution to put down. They’ve ascended through bourgeois parliamentarism, and they serve its role of maintaining a peaceful equilibrium for capitalism — which periodically involves passing repressive laws limiting the right to organise in workplaces and the streets. They are not leading a movement to destroy bourgeois democracy, nor are they proselytising a fake anti-capitalist program, as Hitler’s “National Socialists” did. There’s no sign that a section of the capitalist class has turned to fascism and is backing them. If, faced with revolt, the ruling class decides that the working class must be ***crushed*** and democracy torn down, these functionaries might fall into goosestep. But they are not calling for this now.

This clarity is crucial, because we’re in a class war. The working class needs to know what we face now and what we could in the future if we fail to unite. Divisions in the socialist and union movements allowed the real fascists to take power 80 years ago.

**PUSH for a united front!** Freedom Socialist Party and Radical Women have organised with other anti-fascists to stop neo-Nazis every time they’ve emerged in the past thirty years, both in Australia and the United States. Three-and-a-half years ago, we helped found Campaign Against Racism and Fascism (CARF) as a united front to halt the far-right and Nazi resurgence. However, CARF was undermined by the undemocratic, sectarian behaviour of Socialist Alternative (SA), which transformed it into a loose, controllable action campaign. FSP, RW and others tried to correct these issues. We left CARF when SA’s opposition to the united front and any serious orientation to broaden beyond the Left and bring in unions became clear.

PUSH! Organising and Educating to Build a United Front against Fascism (PUSH!) is a nucleus of groups and individuals working to unify all who are targets of fascists and the far right. This is the only way to defeat the threat we face.

PUSH!’s callout explains: “Our vision is of a united front in which politically divergent groups and individuals cohere around points of agreement and work together respectfully, collaboratively and uncompromisingly in the interest of workers and all the oppressed. A united front is about marching with our own banners and slogans, and striking together.” Democracy, accountability and mutual defence are paramount.

It is reaching out to the organisations of everyone under fascist attack — First Nations, Jews and Muslims, immigrants, refugees and all people of colour, women, LGBTIQ and disabled people, socialists and anarchists. Unions are crucial, because this movement is where workers are organised. They hold the potential for working class power and, for this reason, they are first in fascism’s line of fire.

## Look to ourselves, not the state, to banish violent fascists

In late 2018, eighty-one thousand people petitioned the Department of Home Affairs to stop U.S.-based fascist, Gavin McInnes, from entering Australia. The petition cited McInnes’ calls for violence against women and people of colour and the Southern Poverty Law Center’s listing of Proud Boys, the group he formed, as a hate group. Home Affairs refused McInnes a visa on character grounds. Many celebrated this as a victory. It’s not.

\[Image: \] *This is how to deal with far-right visitors! Countering Milo Yiannopoulos in 2017. Photo by Alison Thorne.*

Last year Chelsea Manning, international cause célèbre persecuted by the U.S. government for exposing its war atrocities in Iraq, also failed Home Affairs’ character test. Despite a petition of nearly 20,000 to grant her a visa, the department didn’t let her in. On the same September night that people piled into the Melbourne Convention and Exhibition Centre to see Manning speak via video hookup, a different audience arrived at the Sofitel hotel, just blocks away, to hear far-right Nigel Farage. Canberra sees this fascist-friendly politician and former leader of the über-right UK Independence Party as no “risk.” This reveals a lot about how the powers-that-be view “community safety.” It’s not lost on those attacked by police every time we organise to stop fascists and the far right.

**Nothing neutral about the state or its “character test.”** Home Affairs uses “good character” as a criterion to grant or deny visas or deport foreign-born people, and it has huge scope for this. According to Section 501 of the Migration Act, the minister only needs to conclude that a person “is or may be, or would or might be, a risk … to the health, safety or good order of the Australian community or a segment of the community … or the health or safety of an individual or individuals.”

Since 2014, when the law was amended to expand ministerial discretion, deportations of residents without Australian citizenship have increased. It doesn’t matter if they have lived in Australia for many years, or most of their lives, and their networks are here. New Zealanders have felt the brunt of this. In the past two years, more than 1,000 have been forcibly deported, more than 60% being Maori or Pacific Islander.

Many of those expatriated were convicted of a crime with a prison sentence, or cumulative sentences, of a year or more — usually for petty offences. A North Korean refugee in Australia since 1993 is being deported, based merely on drug-related crimes and despite the department knowing he will face certain execution or forced labour on his return.

“Character” vetting is an instrument of border control, ***to keep order at home.*** It is part of Australia’s internationally condemned treatment of refugees, ongoing White Australia policy, police racial profiling and intensifying crackdown on civil liberties. We should not be appealing to authorities to exercise it, ***ever.***

**Growing repressive powers.** The shocking attack on the World Trade Center’s Twin Towers on 11 September 2001 diverted public attention away from the real danger for most of us — the collapsing global economy. From Washington DC to London and Canberra, “terrorists” have been the easy excuse for stripping away people’s rights — to “protect the community.” Australia legislated control orders against individuals, detention without charge or trial and searches without warrants. Now children can be detained without charge for up to 14 days. In the last couple of years, Victoria passed laws to define “affray” and “violent behaviour” as crimes with heavy prison sentences. Policing is increasingly militarised and its powers expanded. In Victoria, the Andrews government is funding more than \$2 billion for new weaponry, a state-of-the-art surveillance centre and a data intelligence program that will merge databases and enable predictive tracking. In December 2018, federal Parliament rushed through legislation obligating technology companies to give police and security agencies access to encrypted messages.

**How to deal with fascists.** All of the above are part of the well-oiled machinery operated by the capitalist élite to exploit, oppress and control the working class. It uses this power to protect ***itself*** from the example of those like Chelsea Manning, who courageously stand up to it and show us what we’re capable of. ***Self-defence*** is the protective weapon of the oppressed. When we unite and organise ourselves, we not only shut down the McInneses, we disrupt the machine.

## Drag events targeted by far right

[*Freedom Socialist Organiser*](https://socialism.com/fso-article/drag-events-targeted-by-far-right/) \| JANUARY 2023

On 8 December in Melbourne, word got out that the Proud Boys and other neo-Nazis planned to crash Glitter Nova, a drag event for young queers at St Kilda’s Pride Centre. Stonnington Youth Services, hosting Glitter Nova, capitulated and cancelled, but hundreds still came out to take on the fascists. Meanwhile in Renton, Washington unidentified thugs shot at The Brewmaster’s Taproom in an attempt to shut down its very popular Drag Queen Story Time. But the pub and locals refused to submit, and the show went on — parents and their kids inside enjoying the afternoon and a large community defence rallied outside. Faced with this strong show of unity, the violent bigots didn’t dare show up. In a similar scene outside a New York City library, hundreds withstood freezing conditions to defend a Drag Story Hour on 29 December.

**The best protection against fascists: Stand up to them!** Backing down — as Stonnington Youth Services, supported by Victorian Pride Centre, did — is mistaken and dangerous.

Wannabe führers are stalking the LGBTIQA+ community from Melbourne, Renton and New York City to Colorado Springs and across the world. For trans, queer and non-binary people, nowhere is safe — not drag events or nightclubs, schools or workplaces, home or the streets.

The fascist hit list doesn’t end there. Its strategy is to pick off targets, one by one. Last century’s concentration camps tragically taught us that, if fascism is allowed to grow into a powerful movement, no unionist, socialist or anarchist, person of colour, Jew or Muslim, woman, queer, disabled person, national minority or First nation community is safe.

**The power of working class solidarity.** Fascism comes from capitalism, a brutal system of exploitation driven by its insatiable need for profit. When, inevitably, the economy becomes a pressure cooker and revolt is possible, capitalists will unleash its ultimate weapon, fascism, to crush workers’ ability to organise.

Fascism isn’t here yet, but the far right is growing. No threat can be ignored or minimised. The only way to make neo-Nazi and far-right thugs back off is to confront them — ***every time.** The need for a solid front of working class unity, in all its diversity, is **here.*** Every victory against these terrorists instils confidence in our organised ability to wipe out the menace. And the sooner, the better.

Drag King, Belial B’Zarr, was scheduled to perform at Glitter Nova. They turned out to protest the far right instead, declaring that the decision not to go ahead with the event was “a poor choice.” We agree — Hitler himself said that Nazism could have been stopped if its nucleus had been destroyed before it could grow.

## Posie Parker in Australia: TERFs, Nazis and the fight for trans liberation

## DEBBIE BRENNAN

[*Freedom Socialist Organiser*](https://socialism.com/fso-article/posie-parker-in-australia-terfs-nazis-and-the-fight-for-trans-liberation/) \| APRIL 2023

UK trans-hater Kellie-Jay Keen-Minshull, also known as Posie Parker, recently graced Australia and Aotearoa-New Zealand with her *Let Women Speak* tour. With sponsorship from the far-right Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) and a wardrobe of brightly coloured pantsuits emblazoned with “Woman” across the chest, she came to make a splash. She did, except that the splash was on her — finished off with a litre tomato juice at Auckland’s protest, where a couple of thousand trans rights protesters forced her to go back home.

Keen emerged as a public figure in the United Kingdom alongside transphobia in the feminist movement, which has become increasingly virulent. She founded Standing for Women, whose website states that “woman” must be defined strictly as “adult human female,” because “without this word all of our rights and protections are lost.” “Our rights,” it claims, “were never created for our ‘gender’ but our sex.” Keen opposes any legal recognition of trans people as their identified gender. This covers everything from access to public bathrooms, participation in sports and performing in drag to the use of puberty blockers and hormone replacement therapy for transgender children. She’s a prominent figure in a movement to revoke the UK’s Gender Recognition Act. And the list of Keen’s public abuse and harassment of trans individuals is long.

But Keen is not just a TERF (Trans Exclusive Radical Feminist). She’s firmly aligned with the far right. Besides CPAC, she has received financial backing from the U.S. rightwing think-tank, Heritage Foundation, and the Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF), a global “religious freedom” organisation campaigning against abortion and LGBTIQA+ rights. The ADF is now also notorious for bringing the Texas federal court case against the abortion pill, in which their handpicked, rightwing judge recently suspended its approval by the Federal Drug Administration. Keen belongs to the Hands Across the Aisle Coalition, whose mission is to connect anti-trans radical feminists with homophobic Christian groups. She has done interviews with YouTuber and white ethno-state advocate Jean-François Gariépy, the (self-explanatory) Soldiers of Christ Online and rightwing Fox News commentator Tucker Carlson. Her associations with the hard right extend to open fascists, such as her selfie post with Norwegian neo-Nazi Hans Jørgen Lysglimt and her praise for English fascist Tommy Robinson.

**“Year of the TERF.”** Keen’s Standing for Women website declared 2023 as “the year of the TERF,” announcing her plan for tours “spanning several continents.” In the context of intensified TERF harassment alongside a full-on rightwing assault against women, queers, trans and nonbinary people, Keen’s mission is to link these two camps.

In the months prior to Keen’s Australian tour, fascists were targeting drag and young queer events. This is the rightwing’s new crusade, having moved on from its vicious no-holds-barred campaign against marriage equality, which the queer community was forced to endure for years. On losing this battle, the same religious and political forces tried to push through a federal “religious freedom” bill that would legalise bigotry on all fronts. So far, trans and queer-led resistance has staved this off. But across the world, assaults on bodily autonomy are unrelenting — from the U.S. Supreme Court’s decimation of abortion protection to endless legislations and restrictions designed to repress reproductive rights and gender diversity in the U.S., U.K. and elsewhere. All this is why, across Australia and Aeotearoa, Keen’s small turnouts were overpowered by large counter-actions.

People understand the danger that Keen represents. Her speaking tours are intended to drive a wedge into the feminist movement, which is globally growing more militant as it reaches across borders and connects struggles. The pivotal Women Life Freedom movement of Iran, which embraces those most maligned and persecuted, demonstrates this. In the United States, the National Mobilization for Reproductive Justice, initiated by Radical Women, calls for the defence of queer and trans families and the guarantee of gender-affirming care. At mobilisations on many fronts, placards are expressing the indivisible nature of our fights, such as “No women’s liberation without trans equality” and “Trans rights are women’s/workers’/human rights.”

The far right recruits by appealing to people’s prejudices and anger, and Keen is using transphobia to bring anti-trans feminists over to the far right.

**TERF and far-right ideas intersect.** TERFs are reacting angrily to the rise of a trans movement that is elevating public consciousness about gender diversity. Anti-trans feminists believe that women’s oppression comes from men rather than an economic system that survives by repressing and exploiting women. This biological determinist logic leads to the bizarre notion that trans women are predatory men obsessed with getting into women’s spaces, from bathrooms to sports and even prisons. It extends to children, and the pedophile trope, used against gay men, is having a comeback.

Meanwhile the global economy is disintegrating. For capitalism to prosper, it has always needed the male-ruled family. And for this, a rigidly binary gender regime must be enforced. Women in the role of wife and mother — reproducing workers, caring for them and keeping them fit for work — oils the wheels of profit. There’s no place in this arrangement for queer and trans people. Homophobia, transphobia and male/female-only genders are inextricably tied to the sexist underpinning of the economy. Because capitalism’s other buttress is racism, the penalties are even harsher for people of colour.

Capitalism is the breeding ground for the far right and fascism. The system needs both to enforce its status quo. Feminism is its nemesis, because women’s struggle for liberation from the patriarchal, white supremacist order means its destruction.

But radical feminism’s blinkered and flawed ideology leaves its adherents open to far-right and fascist opportunism. This was on full display at Keen’s Melbourne event. Outside Victoria’s Parliament House, feminist flag-waving demonstrators held up placards with violent anti-trans messages. Nazis — members of the National Socialist Network — gave sieg heil salutes and carried a banner saying “Destroy paedo freaks.” The counter-demonstrators’ chant, “Posie Parker, you can’t hide. You have Nazis on your side,” perfectly summed up the situation.

True to form, the Victorian Police gave the trans-haters and goose-steppers free rein while forcibly holding back the much larger side of trans defenders. Nazis openly parading, under full cop protection, shocked a lot of people, including mainstream commentators. Premier Dan Andrews was compelled to issue a statement that hatred against trans people won’t be tolerated by his government. But the scene at Parliament House laid bare a fact as old as capitalism: police exist to protect the status quo and protect its defenders, no matter how violent they are.

**Stand up, fight back!** Melbourne’s Trans Day of Visibility (TDOV) was trans defenders’ answer to what happened two weeks earlier. Thousands came out on this cold, rainy Friday night in a show of solidarity. From the stage, trans speakers — women, men and genderqueer, workers, unionists and First Nations — articulated with defiance and clarity that trans people’s fight for liberation is for everyone, and feminism that excludes them is not feminism. First Nations speakers talked about transgenderism in their cultures many thousands of years old. They thanked the hundreds of cis people who came out to defend the trans community against the Nazi-supported TERF show. Then we marched to Parliament House and took over the steps.

If sexism and racism are the critical stumps holding up the house of capitalism, then this kind of multi-issue resistance, if sustained, will cause deep cracks. TDOV in Melbourne was a glimpse of what is achievable and needed right now: everyone suffering under the status quo (that’s most working class and oppressed people!) uniting around trans liberation. This fight would free us all. A united front is the coming together of people and groups to organise around agreed principles. We come with different experiences and perspectives, so democracy and accountability are crucial to this unity. And there can be no compromise when fighting against opposing interests: a united front is working class-led.

Victorian Trades Hall co-hosted TDOV, and the involvement of several unions added to the power felt that night. This is important, because trade unions are where workers organise, and they have the power to stop all work. They are gender-diverse and come from every oppressed section of society. This makes unions crucial to every fight, and they are essential for the united front. The task for unionists now is to shift the movement from showing occasional support to taking its place in every fight.

Trans liberation, nothing less! Power to the gender-diverse people!

## Fascists are organising: It’s time for a United Front to stop them

## ELLA SCHULTZE-WILLEY

[*Freedom Socialist Organiser*](https://socialism.com/fso-article/fascists-are-organising-its-time-for-a-united-front-to-stop-them/) \| NOVEMBER 2023

In September 2023, a gang of Nazis, dressed in black and masked, stormed Flinders Street Station, distributing white supremacist pamphlets and harassing commuters. Their large banner announced their target: “Expose Jewish Power.”

Nazis are organising in Melbourne, and their most recent activity indicates an alarming growth in confidence. In a transphobic, queer-hating climate whipped by the far right, the Nazi outfit, National Socialist Network (NSN), has taken centre stage. Sieg heiling members paraded in front of Victoria’s Parliament House at a TERF (Trans Exclusionary Radical Feminists) rally in March 2023. A few fellow fascists, the Proud Boys, threatened a youth pride celebration, Glitter Nova, at Melbourne’s Pride Centre in late 2022. In October 2023, a knife wielding pack of fascists attacked Café Gummo, an anti-fascist venue in the city’s North. Nazis targeted Senator Lidia Thorpe throughout the Voice to Parliament Referendum, releasing a horrifying video of a masked man burning the Aboriginal flag, performing the Nazi salute, and openly threatening Thorpe. For months, Nazis stalked drag shows and social events for young queers.

The fascist threat is not new, and the recent slew of activity demands that we understand what it represents and how to fight back. We can learn a lot from the experience of last century. In German and Italy, fascism arose from extreme economic privation imposed by the imperialist victors of World War I. Inspired by the Russian Revolution, workers in these countries organised in revolt. We learn from Marxist analysts of the day that fascism is an expression of capitalism in distress. It’s a response of last resort by big capital gripped by the fear of revolution and desperate to beat back the working class. Its social base is the middle class — small businesses and entrepreneurs — which, sandwiched between the great classes of capital and labour, will follow whichever looks more powerful at the moment. Capital uses this class as a bulwark to crush workers’ capacity to organise. It channels middle class fears and disillusionment into scapegoating of minority groups and attacks on the labour movement.

Fascist groups today are emboldened, and we know from the ravages of last century just how dangerous they can become if allowed to grow. We must wipe out this threat while it’s still in its initial, weak stage. And we cannot look to state authorities to do this. The cops allowed the Nazis to waltz through Flinders Street Station without any resistance. Countless other cases of the police protecting fascists at protests and allowing them to take up public space show us that they are not on our side. Appealing to local councils to cancel events or state governments to ban behaviour, such as the Nazi salute, not only undermines grassroots organising, it accepts these powers of the state, which it will use against us.

What we need is to bring together all of fascism’s targets in a powerful United Front. Whether you’re an immigrant, part of the LGBTQIA+ community, a woman, a worker, a Muslim, a Jew, we all have a common enemy that needs smashing. At the attack on Café Gummo, Skinheads Against Racial Prejudice bravely chased the Nazis off. Lidia Thorpe rallied mob and fellow anti-racists behind her, receiving an outpouring of solidarity from the grass roots. Melbourne showed up in defence of the trans community against the TERFs and Nazis in March 2023 and then in the thousands for Trans Day of Visibility. It will again on November 25th for the Trans Day of Resistance.

We have the power to take back public spaces and to root out fascists from our communities. We must act now and show that fascism will never have a place in Melbourne or anywhere.

# Part 3 — Organising to defeat far-right bigots

## Dateline Australia: 5,000 rally against homophobia Festival of Light group

## Alison Thorne

[*Freedom Socialist*](https://socialism.com/fs-article/dateline-australia-5000-rally-against-homophobic-festival-of-light-group/) \| February 1990

Just about everybody in Australia knows Fred Nile. He’s a fundamentalist pastor who is a member of the State Parliament of New South Wales. He hates women, Blacks, unions, sex and homosexuality-particularly homosexuality. He’s the founder of a Christian group called, would you believe, the Festival of Light.

His name stands for bigotry and many people find him amusingly bizarre,

Well, he is bizarre, but, like all rightwingers, he’s also dangerous, and when the Sydney gay community learned that he was planning to lead an October 2, 1989 “Cleansing March of Witness for Jesus” down Oxford Street, the gay hub of Sydney, it planned a counter-demo.

**The exorcist.** “Fred is Coming!” said posters in the windows of almost every business in the street. Nile was, once again, campaigning against the annual Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras, a celebration of Gay Pride which is one of the main summer tourist attractions in Sydney, and usually sees tens of thousands of lesbians, gay men and supporters filling the streets. Fred wants to “exorcise” this “abomination,” and he and a bunch of like-minded bigots promised that 100,000 indignant Christians on the street would cleanse the city of its Mardi Gras sins!

He was also very upset because his head, in large effigy, was carried on a tastefully decorated silver platter through central Sydney during the last Mardi Gras. In this guise he was featured on front pages and TV news bulletins across the country!

Nile’s provocation drew a swift response. The 1,000 hardened rightwingers who appeared were outnumbered five to one and drowned out all afternoon. The media loved it and the message was broadcast on national TV that lesbians and gay men are not going to return to the closet! “We’re Out! Out! Out!–And We’re Not Going Back!” I yelled with 5,000 friends as Fred prayed and pranced.

**The censors.** The headlines were a great boost for gay rights. Unfortunately, the day was somewhat marred by officials from the Lesbian and Gay Mardi Gras Committee, who contained and demobilized the action and tried to censor the militants.

Just minutes after the rightwingers arrived, the committee marshals herded people to nearby Green Park for a picnic! One moment I was part of a jam-packed crowd in Taylor Square and minutes later most of the crowd was gone. Fortunately several hundred of the people refused to leave.

The Mardi Gras Committee carefully tried to keep the action focused on gay issues only. They also tried to seize megaphones when they didn’t like the chants being raised! A gay socialist who raised the slogan “Damn the Nile-Block the Street!” was descended upon by a bunch of marshals demanding that he stop. He argued for the counter-demonstration to move on to the road, sit down and prevent Nile from getting to his truck and PA in Taylor Square. We had the numbers to do it, and doing so would have been an enormous victory.

“The police are on our Side,” the marshals bleated. Just then, my comrade Debbie was injured when police horses were used to push back the counter-demo and allow the right wing through. “The police are on my foot, not on our side,” she muttered.

During the clash, I spotted a leader of the Committee to Defend Black Rights, which is campaigning against the hundreds of murders of Aboriginal people which occur while they are in prison and police custody. What the hell would he make of the statement that the police are on our side? I was reminded of the 1988 “Invasion Day” March by Aboriginal people and allies against the Bicentennial “Celebrations.” Marshals there had also attempted to censor socialists on the grounds that “other” issues- like lesbian and gay rights-might “confuse” Aboriginal people.

This kind of paternalism is what divides and demoralizes social movements.

**Out of the ghetto.** Earlier I’d heard a veteran activist yell at a member of the Mardi Gras committee that he came to fight for gay liberation, not for a commercial gay ghetto or “friendship” with the police. “Get a sense of history,” he told the officious marshal.

The first Sydney Gay Mardi Gras was held in 1978 in June on the anniversary of the Stonewall riots, which had definitely not been about finding a niche in the heterosexist setup. Sydney lesbians and gay men had their own Stonewall that night, with the police making 130 arrests!

We beat back the bigots on October 2. Nile was made to look foolish, particularly when a national poll published the next week showed strong majority support for homosexual law reform.

But the actions of the Sydney gay bureaucracy are dangerous, because it is only through the unrestrained mass mobilization of the gay community, linked with the struggles of all the oppressed, that we can make such victories stick-for good.

## Anti-abortion terror re-emerges in Melbourne

## RADICAL WOMEN

[*Freedom Socialist Bulletin*](https://socialism.com/fsb-article/anti-abortion-terror-re-emerges-in-melbourne/) \| Winter/Spring 2001

\[Image: \] *Confronting the fetus fetishists: Radical Women in action! Photo by Suzette Hunter.*

**Right To Life, your Name’s A Lie**, goes a well-used chant against the fetus worshippers organised by a tiny band of Catholic fanatics centred on Margaret Tighe. It continues: “you don’t care if women die!” Nor ordinary workers going about their job. When, on July 16, a man of unknown identity shot and killed a security guard at the Fertility Control Clinic, Tighe couldn’t wait to get on radio to claim that murder is to be expected “because people get angry at what goes on in such places.” Apart from the obscene callousness towards the family of the dead worker, this comment should be seen for what it is, a deliberate encouragement for more acts of terrorism against the patients and workers at what are, at present, legal medical facilities.

**Low-level intimidation** was occurring even as the gunman entered the East Melbourne clinic, carrying enough ammunition to slaughter 30 people and sufficient incendiary material to burn the building to the ground. A tiny cluster of the “Helpers of God’s Precious Infants” stood on the footpath, waving the effigies of late-term plastic “fetuses” they try to pass off as early term embryos and shouting “spiritual guidance” at women as they arrived for appointments at the abortion facility. Nobody suggests that anyone of these pathetic individuals had any direct connection with the killer. But they are the low ebb of a decades-long fear campaign by fanatics such as the Right to Life leadership.

If we were to believe the media, the death of the guard is a tragedy — but not also the armed attack on an abortion service, its practitioners and the women who use it. Melbourne’s Age newspaper cautioned the public to stay cool. “In Australia, although there are individual politicians who would ban abortions if they could, both sides of politics have more or less accepted that abortion is a fact of life that cannot be suppressed by criminal law.”

This is drivel. For women everywhere, the issue is our right to control our own bodies and lives. But the capitalist system needs women controlled, bearing its labour force and caring for it. The pro-barefoot-and-pregnant forces are on a mission: to drag us from the workplace, where we’ve enjoyed some independence, back into the home. In Australia, abortion is still in state criminal codes. It’s true that both the NSW Levine ruling, and the Victorian Menhennitt judgment do give women strictly circumscribed access to terminations. But as long as abortion remains a criminal offence, this access can be removed at the whim of any populist government.

**Australia’s fetus fetishists** have not been as effective as in the U.S. The East Melbourne clinic, founded by Bertram Wainer nearly 30 years ago, exists today because of the feminists and socialists who defended it against the right wing. The overwhelming majority of Australians support women’s right to abortion. Each political attempt to close off the option has been resoundingly defeated. Anti-abortion rallies are always outnumbered by pro-abortion demonstrators. But the war is not over, and to dismiss the attack on July 16 as an act of a lone psychopath is very dangerous.

In the U.S. and Canada, the anti-abortion movement is infested with Nazis, Ku Klux Klansmen, anti-semites and other racists. The murder of Dr Garson Romalis in November 1994 is just one example. Romalis, a Jewish activist, performed abortions at Vancouver (British Columbia) General Hospital. In the lead-up to his murder, Canadian anti-abortion protests included anti-Semitic sloganeering, and Nazis supported the shooting. Yet the police denied that the attack was political or abortion-related.

**Misogynist backlash.** Women’s reproductive rights are on the firing line. Australia is no exception. We only have to watch John Howard trying to deny lesbians and independent women access to fertility technology. Howard is, as usual, tugging his forelock to the followers of Pauline Hanson, whose scapegoats also include unionists, Aborigines and immigrants. Feminists need to make strong alliances with all groups whose rights are drawing fire. Unity against a common enemy is our powerful defence. This was shown not long ago when such a united front drove Nazis out of Melbourne.

Fortunately, the situation has not yet reached the level of open warfare evident in the U.S., where clinic staff have been forced to use weapons to defend themselves. Still, the fact that security staff are required speaks volumes about the threat here —a threat now tragically realised. This assassin and all who have aided, abetted or simply incited him must be prosecuted to the full extent of the law. Supporters of abortion rights must prepare to defend clinics under attack. Government must provide 24 hour protection for clinics and staff who request it and repeal all anti-abortion laws — which give solace to Right to Life and its ilk.

Anti-abortion terror will not disappear until women win our reproductive freedom. That can’t happen under capitalism, but preparing for the battle and fighting each step of the way will get us there.

Outside Melbourne’s Fertility Control Clinic, a large banner that reads “Women will decide their fate!” stretches along the street. Placards call for free, 24-hour childcare, employer-funded paid maternity leave and equal pay for women. People shout, “Right to Life your name’s a lie, you don’t care if women die.” This is the defence cordon organised by Campaign for Women’s Reproductive Rights (CWRR) on a Saturday morning each month when Helpers of God’s Precious Infants congregate to harass clinic staff and women using the service.

These fanatics appear with their statue of Mary, rosaries and grisly pictures of dead infants misrepresented as fetuses. One of them videos the clinic defenders and anyone entering or leaving. Since mid 2005, pro-choice activists have kept the zealots well away from the medical facility, separated by a wide, busy street. On two occasions, the fetus worshippers were too frightened by our numbers to even show up!

The Fertility Control Clinic (FCC) has been the target of anti-abortionists since it opened in 1973. In 2001, a man who stormed the crowded waiting room and threatened to blow the place up murdered a security guard. Every weekday morning, Right to Lifers stand at the entrance, abusing women as they go in. Established by Dr Bertram Wainer as Australia’s first abortion clinic, the FCC is today the only one to perform terminations after 12 weeks.

**Fetus fetish.** The right wing chooses abortion as their frontline offensive to keep women in their place — in a straitjacket of domestic servitude. A 1969 court ruling by Justice Menhennit allowed terminations in Victoria if a medical panel decides that carrying a pregnancy endangers a woman’s mental or physical health. That judgement still stands. Jo Wainer’s recently published book, *Lost: Illegal Abortion Stories* , relates the personal stories of working class women dealing with unplanned pregnancies before *Menhennit*. Their accounts give a clear, very chilling, look inside the cruelty of a society which, less than 40 years ago, punished sex outside marriage, forbade birth control against the husband’s wishes and gave women no option but the backyard abortionist or the coathanger.

What’s an effective way to take from women all control over how they’ll live their lives? Call a fetus a baby. Create the myth that it’s a living person and then give it rights above the woman’s.

Abracadabra! She is recast into a breeding machine and homemaker. She’s removed from the world she

could have known — and influenced! — as an independent, active player.

The right wing is hell-bent on turning back the clock. Its battle to stop access to Mifepristone (RU486), a drug that chemically induces abortion, was as vehement as its sustained attacks on abortion clinics. The drug has been unavailable in Australia since 1996. An amendment to the *Therapeutic Goods Act* , introduced that year by anti-abortionist Senator Brian Harradine and supported by the Australian Labor Party and Western Australian Greens Senator Christabel Chamarette, succeeded in giving veto powers over its importation to the Minister for Health. The current Minister is Tony Abbott, dedicated “family values” patriarch and anti-choice campaigner.

In October 2005, when the Democrats initiated a private member’s bill to return discretionary power to the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA), the right wing went into a frenzy. A sensation-loving media spread statistical fabrications pumped out by the likes of the Australians Against RU486 — headed by Abbott’s former media adviser. Supposed links to cancer, mental illness and mysterious deaths in the United States were cited to head off the campaign against the medicine. Liberal MP, Dana Vale,\*\*\*\* even pulled the racist card when she warned that Muslims would overrun the country if the drug were let in. Thankfully, a pro-choice, cross-party parliamentary alliance, led by women and responding to feminists across the country, overturned the ban in February this year. The TGA has since cleared the drug as safe, exposing the right wing’s lies. The next obstacles are red tape and profit gouging that make it too hard for practitioners to import the drug.

Equally ominous is Tony Abbott’s stacking of the Australian Health Ethics Committee with his fellow religious moralists. Almost half of the members now have links with Catholic organisations. Some have already voiced their opposition to the use of embryonic cells for stem cell research, and Medicare funding for abortions will certainly become another battleground.

**Spot the fake pregnancy counsellor.** Immediately following its defeat over RU486, the Howard Government approved \$60 million for abortion “counselling,” which will include a 24-hour hotline.

The Australian Federation of Pregnancy Support Services, the peak body of all anti-abortion services, has received funding from the government for the past decade, and it is expected to be the beneficiary of these new funds. There is also a move by anti-abortion parliamentarians to tie Medicare funding for abortions to compulsory viewing of ultrasounds and pictures of fetuses in development.

Women’s experiences in the United States give a good idea of what to expect. The Bush Administration has pumped millions of dollars into such centres, which, according to *The New York Times* , outnumber actual abortion providers. In Indiana, a young woman attending an appointment at a Planned Parenthood clinic mistakenly walked into a “crisis pregnancy centre” which shares the same parking lot. It’s common for these operators to locate themselves next to a genuine provider for this purpose. The young woman gave her personal details, and the centre then harassed her for days — going to her school, phoning her father’s workplace and showing up at her home to pressure her not to have an abortion. This conduct is documented as typical. These centres also give misinformation about the termination procedure, claiming it to be painful and life threatening with long-term emotional and physical effects. Women have reported similar deception in Australian centres run by Right to Life.

**The hidden battles.** Since a burst of public debate in 2004 about childcare and paid maternity leave, these pivotal issues have gone underground. The gutting of affordable, available childcare and lack of a national paid maternity leave scheme are the silent offensive against women’s reproductive rights.

Australia and the United States stand out as the only industrialised countries without a universal entitlement to paid maternity leave. This puts us behind most of the planet — 120 countries, to be exact. In Australia, 60% of working women have no paid maternity leave, and this will drop further as Australian Workplace Agreements kick in. New mothers get only a maternity payment from Centrelink of around \$4,000 — hardly enough to cover the nappies!

Employers in Australia claim they can’t afford it. Yet Singapore, Switzerland, Costa Rica, Sri Lanka, Indonesia and Lebanon are just some countries that provide employer-funded schemes covering working mothers’ full earnings. By paying a levy based on the number of employees (women and men), into a publicly managed fund, all employers would be able to meet the costs.

Without paid maternity leave, 60% of working women are in an impossible situation: they can’t afford childcare, and without childcare, they can’t afford to work. Approximately 160,000 mothers want to work but are unable to.

Earning only two-thirds of the take-home pay of men, most women cannot make genuine, independent choices about their lives. Having children means economic dependence, either on a partner or social security. Equal pay, childcare and paid maternity leave are vital to a woman’s decisions about if or when she’ll have children, and how many. These questions cannot be separated from the fight for freely accessible abortion.

**Racist, homophobic, anti-poor.** The Blue Mountains Family Support Service in Katoomba, New South Wales put out a plea on behalf of refugee women placed on a Bridging Visa E, which denies them access to Medicare, Centrelink payments or employment. Pregnant women have contacted the service, because routine tests or safe deliveries are impossible for them unless they pay the medical expenses upfront. A public hospital stay of one or two days costs \$3,000 – \$4,000. If there is a complication, the fees can escalate to \$10,000.

A recent report by Kerry Arabena, Chair of the ACT Health Promotion Board, exposed how Indigenous women are denied reproductive choice. As long as paternalistic government institutions have power over Aboriginal communities, women have no autonomy. For example, for a young, pregnant woman, says Arabena, “it is unlikely that she has accessed any quality sexual health education, and cannot access pregnancy testing kits that are readily available in pharmacies across Australia, except by asking someone in authority to provide one to her in a clinical setting.” She also cannot use internet or phone counselling services that would enable her to make a decision. To perpetuate the dispossession of Australia’s first nations, stripping Aboriginal women of their reproductive rights has been crucial to the overall genocidal policies of the past 220 years.

Women who are lesbian, single, poor, older or with a disability still can’t freely access Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART). In Victoria, access to donor insemination is limited to married or de facto heterosexual couples, unless a woman is clinically infertile. Eligibility for in vitro fertilisation (IVF) has been opened to lesbians and single women, but only if they are “medically infertile.” Lesbian and gay couples in Victoria cannot adopt children. The laws governing access to ART and adoption are currently being reviewed. But the recent homophobic hype set off by Sydney’s *Daily Telegraph* over storybooks that feature same-sex parents was a reminder of the right wing’s capacity for hysteria whenever its happy family ideal is threatened by progress. The portrayal of joyful preschoolers, loved by two-mum parents and having fun in their Rainbow Cubby house, sent the vigilantes ballistic. The homophobia, fanned by NSW Premier Morris Iemma, was quickly answered by a protest rally outside the State Parliament.

And what welfare mum isn’t victimised by the Howard Government’s Welfare-to- Work laws? Single mothers, so long demonised as parasites, are now being financially punished. By November 2008, the government will force approximately 111,000 sole parents and 60,000 disability pensioners onto the more miserly unemployment benefit. The majority are mothers.

**Reproductive rights unite struggles *everywhere*!** Throughout most of human history, society was based on shared wealth and cooperation. Women were revered for their reproductive powers and looked to as the leaders who kept production humming and relations harmonious. The capacity to produce beyond daily needs led to the fragmenting of production and elevation of certain people over everyone else. Class divisions and privatisation then came into being. Women were thus reduced to property. They, their wombs and their children became prized possessions, for fathers or husbands to own but ultimately for the ruling class to control and profit from.

Another chant outside the Fertility Control Clinic is “Not the Church, Not the State. Women Will Decide their Fate!” This is a favourite, because it’s revolutionary. Once women *again* independently control our reproduction, we’ll have won a different world. This fight to win back women’s independence is itself making the change and belongs to everybody battered and used by this profit system.

In the United States, the State of South Dakota recently banned abortions. Immediately, Cecilia Fire Thunder, President of the Oglala Sioux Tribal Council, announced that she would set up an abortion clinic, open to all women. Because of historical treaties between the U.S. Government and First Nations, the Pine Ridge Reservation is outside the jurisdiction of the State Government. Fire Thunder put reproductive rights in a nutshell: “Ultimately, this is a much bigger issue than just abortion. It’s time for women to reclaim their bodies.”

The victory around Mifepristone and the pledge by the Victorian ALP Government to decriminalise abortion, *at last,* are milestones, although we’ll probably have to organise to keep the ALP to its word. Legal wins, important as they are, are not permanent. *Roe vs Wade* , the historic ruling of the U.S. Supreme Court in 1973, has been methodically dismantled by a well-organised, corporate-bankrolled right wing. Only a massive, well-organised, multi-issue, integral, grassroots movement can bring on the change. Imagine a defence line outside the Fertility Control Clinic with contingents of queers, students, unionists, Indigenous people, refugees, single mums and disability rights activists! That’s a start. These movements, working together, need to put reproductive rights centre-stage. Imagine again: the union movement organising for childcare and paid maternity leave, the end to welfare-to-work and abortion on demand — and ready to stop work!

Fire Thunder is now under attack for her stand. We need a bold movement to follow her example and stand with her.

Defend the Fertility Control Clinic!

## Never Going Back! – Keep abortion legal in Victoria: Build a movement to stop the far right

[*Freedom Socialist Organiser*](https://socialism.com/fso-article/never-going-back-keep-abortion-legal-in-victoria-build-a-movement-to-stop-the-far-right/) \| OCTOBER 2012

On October 10, 2008, the moment Victoria’s Parliament voted to legalise abortion, spectators from the far right leapt to their feet and yelled “Retribution!” and vowed to overturn the new law. This anti-abortion minority represents less than six percent of the population, according to the Victorian Law Reform Commission Report (2008). Yet this ultra-right fringe, well financed and connected, has escalated its activity over the past four years. Since 2008, its daily harassment of East Melbourne’s Fertility Control Clinic has intensified, and several “40 Days for Life” campaigns have targeted health clinics that perform abortions in Melbourne and other Australian cities. Throughout 2012, anti-abortionists have held “vigils” outside Parliament, holding up lengthy banners covered with thousands of crosses, which they claim represent the number of abortions in Victoria since January. The annual “March for the Babies,” headed by Liberal Party Member of Parliament Bernie Finn, busses anti- abortionists from across Victoria and interstate to demonstrate, with their hateful messages, against the 2008 reform. This year, the organisers imported Lord Nicholas Windsor, an anti-abortion zealot they tout as a member of the British royal family, as if that adds weight to his bigoted views.

A central mission of the far right is to force women back to the century before last, when life choices for most were limited to motherhood or low-paid, dead-end jobs. Ending an unwanted pregnancy generally meant persecution and a high risk of horrible injury or death.

*Below is a talk by Debbie Brennan to a public meeting, Is fascism still a problem for workers?, convened by Australia Asia Worker Links on 5 September 2012. Brennan is the Melbourne Organiser for Radical Women, longtime reproductive justice activist and defender of the Fertility Control Clinic.*

In May 2009, Dr George Tiller was shot dead in Wichita Kansas. Tiller was one of the few doctors in the country who performed late-term abortions. His assassin was a fascist, long involved in far-right and anti-abortion groups. Today, we watch with horror abortion rights being torn to shreds in the United States, where abortion was legalised throughout the country in 1973. Last year, 92 measures restricting access to abortion were passed in 24 states — the most ever. The Republican Party platform now bans ***any abortion,*** even in the case of rape. Closer to home, those of us who have faced off anti-abortion mobilisations over the past decades have recognised Nazis among them. Sitting on the shelf of the Western Australian Attorney General’s office is a “personhood” bill giving full rights to a foetus. This is expected to be put to parliament any time.

Today’s far right has many faces — some wear Nazi uniform, others carry rosaries and harass abortion clinics, still others are power-dressed business people and parliamentarians. Whether they wear swastikas, religious symbols or suits, this movement oils the tracks for a fascist movement, in the event that capitalism has to save itself and stop revolution.

The strategy of the ultra-right is to build a mass political movement to disenfranchise and disorganise the working class. They violently oppose women’s independence, marriage equality, immigrant and refugee rights, the sovereign rights of Indigenous nations, and workers’ rights to organise on the job and to solidarise with each other. ***They understand how these struggles are interconnected.*** Here’s a recent example: at last October’s March for the Babies — where we again saw known fascists — there was a placard that said: “100,000 dead babies every year!! 100,000 new migrants.”

So, why is abortion so important for the far right/fascists? In 1932, Leon Trotsky characterised fascism as “a mass movement growing out of the collapse of capitalism.” Its goal is to crush the working class and its organisations and ensure that workers shoulder the total burden of the economic crisis. Fascism is capitalism up against the wall — at its most desperate, with gloves off. When we consider the role that capitalism assigns to women — to breed the next generation of workers and sustain them throughout life and to reproduce a capitalist culture of submission to authority (father, husband, priest, boss or the State) — then we understand the obsession with the foetus. It’s about controlling women’s fertility, denying women autonomy over their own bodies and their life choices.

We can’t separate the banning of abortion from forced sterilisation — fascists don’t! Controlling women’s fertility means denying them choice about abortion or having a child. There’s a long history of women deemed unfit — with disability, Aboriginal and immigrant and on welfare — being sterilised or their children removed by the State. Nazi Germany was big on “racial” and “moral” “hygiene.” Eugenics lives today, whether covertly or overtly, and it is worldwide. Women with Disabilities Australia’s recently published *Moving Forward and Gaining Ground: The Sterilisation of Women and Girls with Disabilities in Australia* exposes the extent of paternalism — practised by courts, parents and carers — that controls the bodies and lives of females as young as 11 years old.

For the far right and fascists, there’s no place for freely available postnatal care and childcare, fully paid parental leave, equal pay, free education, healthcare and housing, free disability supports, reproductive technology for all women, including lesbian and single women. These are what women need to make real reproductive choices and live as active, independent players in society. Women are simply meant to be lifelong, dutiful housewives. This is the essence of patriarchal capitalism, which the far right and fascists intend to preserve.

Reproductive rights are workers’ rights; these struggles are indivisible. If a reproductive rights movement is to have any force, it must be multi-issue. A revolutionary workers’ movement must connect all the dots of our struggles if we’re to push back the far right and ultimately win control over our collective destiny.

**Take action!** Want to help build this movement? Join Campaign for Women’s Reproductive Rights! Campaign for Women’s Reproductive Rights (CWRR) is a multi-gendered united front of grassroots organisations and individual activists that fights for reproductive rights for all women. CWRR initiates Victoria’s annual October rallies to keep abortion legal and organises the defence of the Fertility Control Clinic in East Melbourne.

## Beating Back the Far Right: How the World Congress of Families got the welcome it deserved

The WCF got the welcome it deserved from a determined and disciplined crowd.

On August 30, a quiet industrial area in Hallam, on Melbourne’s outskirts, teemed with action. Community resistance had trounced the ultra-right World Congress of Families (WCF). It was now reduced to a small, hardcore event. We were celebrating! Accustomed to holding large gatherings around the world, the WCF helplessly watched as its extravaganza unraveled. With all other venue options cancelled following a concerted activist campaign, it retreated to Hallam. In all of WCF’s 19 years, this hadn’t happened before.

The WCF is an international network of extreme-right religious and fathers’ rights groups, based in the U.S. It formed in 1995, in the wake of the Soviet Union’s collapse and capitalism’s takeover. The Illinois-based Howard Center for Family, Religion and Society joined with far-right academics at Moscow State University to bring together like-minded reactionaries from the former Soviet Union and the U.S. to stem what they claimed was a crisis of the family caused by feminism and homosexuality.

The WCF has held seven world congresses in Czechoslovakia, Switzerland, Mexico, Poland, The Netherlands, Spain and Australia and several regional conferences, from Eastern Europe and Africa to Latin America and the Caribbean. The next world congress is planned for Salt Lake City in October 2015.

**Pure evil.** WCF works with right-wing politicians to enact horrific laws and policies around the world. In Texas, it had a hand in blocking women’s access to healthcare, from basic check-ups and contraception to breast screenings and abortion. In Kenya, Ecuador, Mexico, Spain and Ireland, the WCF has spearheaded and funded opposition to laws allowing abortion if the mother’s life is at risk. From Russia and Eastern Europe to Nigeria and Uganda, the WCF has bankrolled and backed the criminalising and targeting of LGBTI people.

The Melbourne event, titled “Life, Family & Freedom,” billed supposed experts, such as Dr Angela Lanfranchi, who still pushes the debunked claim that abortion causes breast cancer, and Dr Larry Jacobs, who champions Russian President Putin’s crackdown on queers and uppity women.

Release of the speakers list that included high-ranking Australian government Ministers and right-wing Members of Parliament set off the alarm bells: Eric Abetz, federal Minister for Employment and Prime Minister Abbott’s slasher of the public sector; Kevin Andrews, federal Minister for Social Services; Robert Clark, Victoria’s Attorney-General; and MPs Cory Bernardi, Bernie Finn and Fred Nile, notorious crusaders against abortion, homosexuality and Muslims.

These politicians are widely loathed. Abortion rights and marriage equality campaigners have fought against their “family values” for over a decade. The battles for reproductive and LGBTI rights are more intense than ever. Since March this year, people across the country have repeatedly hit the streets in the hundreds of thousands — many for the first time — to protest Abbott’s brutal refugee policy, war on unions and the most vicious budget in generations. Victorians have turned out in force against the Napthine government’s assault on the right to protest. The WCF congress made this alignment of the political and religious far right unmistakable.

In mid-July, a supporter alerted Radical Women (RW) to the WCF’s upcoming congress. At that point, LGBTI activists were responding to a callout by popular satirist Pauline Pantsdown to fill up the seats by registering for tickets.

RW put out a call to mobilise against this “coming together of a well-connected far-right movement, aimed at advancing what Abbott’s budget and policies started: drive women and the most oppressed back to the homes, closets, countries, poverty and Dickensian work hellholes we have struggled to escape and overcome.” The callout said: “The congress offers everyone who is enraged by the wholesale onslaught on our rights an opportunity to confront the far right and its far-reaching agenda with multi-issue resistance.”

RW stated that open and democratic meetings would decide policy, demands and organisational details. Socialist, feminist, union, LGBTI, student and progressive organisations and activists came to the first meeting held at the National Union of Workers.

**Model for grassroots organising.** Democracy and openness dispelled the potential for sectarian or opportunist behaviour, which too often mars coalition work. Everyone got down to working out how to achieve the agreed objective, which was to disrupt the WCF event: not only must the WCF be routed by grassroots resistance, we had to make it impossible for their movement to recruit and grow.

Agreement on what to achieve was based on a common understanding that this far-right fest would not be confined to abortion and marriage equality. Preserving the “natural family” means protecting a global profit system at war with those it exploits and oppresses. All rights, on all fronts, are under fire. This is the message we had to get out and mobilise around. The slogan we chose was “Unite to Beat Back the Far Right: Our Bodies, Our Lives, Our Right to Organise!” We became the Coalition to Beat Back the Far Right, and we set out to organise a “Welcome the WCF deserves.”

After the initial callout, we discovered that two other protest actions were being organised by separate groups. Equal Love was planning an LGBTI rights rally in the mid-morning, and another group was holding a Block Party against Hate in the afternoon. The coalition’s first organising meeting decided that to avoid competing, we would promote August 30 as a Day of Action: our early morning “welcome,” followed by Equal Love’s rally and finishing with the Block Party.

The weekly meetings weighed up risks, advantages and the balance of forces. We prepared for the full enforcement of Victoria’s new move-on laws, knowing that the police, enforcers of the status quo, would protect the WCF against a protesting community.

We outreached everywhere with our multi-issue message. Everyone hurting under Abbott or targeted by the far right — unionists, the unemployed, pensioners, single mothers, students, Aboriginal Australians, refugees and immigrants, people with disability — would want to “welcome” the WCF. We planned an open mic for these voices.

We took this message to the media, calling a press conference at Victorian Trades Hall. Our diverse panel of speakers — which included a public sector unionist with a bag over her head to highlight the gag on a sector ruthlessly being cut by Eric Abetz — spoke their truths. We dealt with the predictable questions: Yes, we respect the far right’s free speech, and we will exercise our right to say how dangerous they are and drown them out. No, our action won’t be violent — it will be disciplined, and we’ll defend ourselves against the violence of the police and the WCF. No, we won’t tell you our tactics for the day. Journalists generally were on side with the community resistance, and some were plainly sympathetic.

**The chase.** Disrupting the WCF brought like-minded activists together. Melbourne’s coalition worked interstate with Pauline Pantsdown and groups including Equal Marriage Rights Australia and Rainbow Army. Collaborative sleuthing enabled us to track the WCF’s moves as the mounting community pressure forced venues — from Catholic churches to a wedding reception business — to cancel.

Activist networks were a-buzz with updates of the chase. With the mounting community protest, the bad press for anyone associating with the WCF spread. The invited politicians cracked under the pressure, and all except MP Fred Nile pulled out at the eleventh hour. On August 29, WCF informed its rump of registrants that they would be meeting at Catch the Fire Ministry in Hallam. Only this way-out sect (a WCF partner) would host the congress.

Our work was done. On August 30, we went to Hallam to celebrate.

**The victory!** When we arrived at 7.30 am, the place was swarming with police and security. This was no surprise. From 8.00 am, the isolated industrial precinct, where Catch the Fire Ministry is located, filled up with protesters ready to “welcome” the arriving congress goers, plus more police and reporters.

We blocked the car entrance, so that the diehards — the only ones attending the congress — would have to walk in through a “gauntlet of shame.” Victory speeches, chants and Monty Python’s song, “Every sperm is sacred,” blasted as congress attendees arrived.

The “welcome” was disciplined: our aim was to celebrate and conclude the victory. Victoria Police put its power on display. Seeing the arrivals of more foot police, mounted police and an enormous mobile lock-up was like watching a military parade.

Their intention was to teach resisters, present and future, a lesson. Although the police had nothing to charge protesters with, they demonstrated their power, forcing some to the ground and handcuffing them and moving on others. They even threatened our police liaison with a summons for assaulting an officer.

Violence also came from the WCF, while police stood by. Community activist medics and legal observers were a vital support throughout the action.

For those new to taking on the status quo, the morning was a crash course in the true nature of the capitalist State. Veterans of this struggle played a critical role in preparing for it and drawing the important lessons.

Protesters were outraged, but not intimidated. The action was triumphant and jubilant. When the Block Party bus arrived at lunchtime, everyone was ready to party.

**Onwards!** Activists in the U.S. who followed the victory contacted RW and other organisers to prepare for action against the WCF in Salt Lake City.

In Australia, we tasted the power of the United Front, where working class organisations and individuals work openly and democratically around an agreed objective and demands. Political differences are respected; we bring our distinct slogans, but we march under the same banner.

From this unity, a wider collaborative network formed, which we can draw on again. The coalition slogan, “Unite to Beat Back the Far Right,” is achievable. The shared multi-issue vision enables us to build for future victories as the far right ramps up its crackdown on resistance in a desperate bid to save the dying capitalist system.

From protecting and extending abortion reform to defending Muslims under vicious attack, the united front is the working class’s proven weapon.

## An exclusion zone will not stop anti-abortion harassment

[*Freedom Socialist Organiser*](https://socialism.com/fso-article/an-exclusion-zone-will-not-stop-anti-abortion-harassment/) \| OCTOBER 2015

\[Image: \]\[Image: \]

Saturday, August 22 was an important day at East Melbourne’s Fertility Control Clinic (FCC), for staff and defenders alike. This was the 10th anniversary of the clinic defence — it is a decade since grassroots pro-choice activists began protecting the clinic, and the women using it, from vicious anti-abortion harassment. Every month, without fail, a barricade of defenders with banners and placards has forced the Helpers of God’s Precious Infants (HOGPI) to retreat to the opposite side of the wide and busy street. Over the years, hundreds have joined in stopping HOGPI from holding their “rosary parade” at the clinic entrance.

Many defenders — original, longtime and new — came together on this August morning to mark the anniversary, share memories and speak about why the community defence is so critical. The message of solidarity and thanks from the clinic staff made this clear: “You have stood with us when it seems no one else would” — “no one” being the Victorian Police and Melbourne City Council, which have aided the harassment through their inaction.

Earlier this year, the FCC took Melbourne City Council to the Victorian Supreme Court for failing its duty, under the Public Health and Wellbeing Act, to remove “nuisances” that impede access to health treatment. The FCC gave evidence of the daily stalking, photographing clients, physical assaults, taunts and threats, and blocking the entrance. It recounted the clinic’s regular complaints to the council. It warned that an anti-abortion fanatic had murdered the security guard in 2001. But the court ruled (four days after the anniversary of clinic defence) that, although HOGPI’s conduct arguably constitutes a nuisance, Melbourne City Council cannot be compelled to stop them!

**Can’t count on the State to protect women’s rights.** Given a green light by the Supreme Court, the harassment will escalate. Meanwhile a bill to establish a 150-metre exclusion zone around the FCC is now before the Victorian Parliament. The bill, which would amend the Public Health and Wellbeing Act to prohibit the behaviour HOGPI has subjected the clinic to, is expected to pass.

Tasmania is the only Australian jurisdiction to have an exclusion zone around abortion clinics. The Australian Capital Territory and New South Wales are attempting similar bills.

Pro-choicers are cheering exclusion zone legislation as the answer to decades of anti-abortion violence. But it’s not.

The anti-abortion movement is on a mission to remove women’s rights and access to abortion — whether legally or through violence. In the United States, exclusion zones have not stopped clinic bombings, assassinations of abortion practitioners, or street harassment. Anti-abortionists recently challenged Massachusetts’ buffer zone in the Supreme Court. And they won. In 2014, the court ruled that the law interfered with their access to their audience and the public streets to communicate their message — in other words, their “free speech” rights. Although the decision applies only to Massachusetts, exclusion zones throughout the U.S. are in the firing line. For years, the far right has also successfully won new laws and regulations that, bit by bit, have gutted *Roe v Wade* , the Supreme Court’s celebrated 1973 decision that legalised abortion throughout the country.

In Australia this October, the anti-abortion group, Right to Life, invited Operation Rescue (OR) from the U.S. to boost its campaigns against clinic exclusion zones and an abortion decriminalisation bill in New South Wales. OR is notorious for bombing clinics, advocating the execution of abortion practitioners and demanding that women who choose abortion be prosecuted for murder.

While the proposed Victorian bill specifically proscribes harassing behaviour, any action to defend the clinic — ***when*** it comes under renewed anti-abortion assault — will surely be prosecuted. In 2010, Melbourne City Council targeted ***clinic defenders*** with its bylaws. It issued a Notice to Comply for a banner tied to two street poles, claiming that this breached a bylaw against “erecting an advertising sign or other thing.” The penalty is a hefty fine. A year later, the same council, backed by the fully armed force of the Victoria Police, used these same laws to crush the Melbourne Occupy movement. There can be no doubt that Melbourne City Council — which has never used its existing powers to stop the anti-abortion “nuisance,” but has enforced them against clinic defenders — would crack down on pro-choice activists who defend the clinic.

There are precedents for an exclusion zone around the clinic. For example, in 2014 the Victorian Parliament legislated “safety zones” to protect timber harvesting in state forests from community protest. An exclusion zone for the FCC would significantly expand the State’s ability to quash the right to organise and protest. Why stop at a forest or a clinic? Buffer zones around businesses could halt union pickets. Around vital central city precincts, they could head off growing protest — such as the massive mobilisations against the forced closures of remote Aboriginal communities that shut down Melbourne several times this year. These are not far-fetched possibilities. Asking the State — which just weeks ago planned to send the Border Force into Melbourne’s streets to check people’s visas — to establish another exclusion zone is ***dangerous***.

**Only a movement will end the harassment.** As the FCC staff’s 10th anniversary message affirms, **organised activism** for reproductive rights has been their **only** defence. A Parliament that took ***50 years*** to decriminalise abortion, a police force and local council that have never stepped in to stop the terror cannot be looked to for protection. They exist to protect the rights of property and profit against the rights and organised power of women, workers and the oppressed. We can’t allow their powers to shut down ours.

## Make the links: Far-right attack on Safe Schools Coalition is part of a broad agenda

## ANGIE THOM

[*Freedom Socialist Organiser*](https://socialism.com/fso-article/make-the-links-far-right-attack-on-safe-schools-coalition-is-part-of-a-broad-agenda/) \| JUNE 2016

In March this year, Prime Minister Turnbull announced that his government would not continue funding the Safe Schools Coalition. This innovative anti-bullying program was rolled out nationally in 2011 to address the fact that two-thirds of LGBTIQ kids are being bullied at school.

**Long tawdry history.** Australia has a shameful histroy of hysteria when it comes to programs designed to support LGBTIQ youth. In 1975, the pioneering *Young, Gay and Proud* publication by the Gay Teachers and Students Group and distributed to Victorian high schools by the teachers’ union was banned by the state government.

In the ‘90s a New South Wales government witch-hunt demonised the books, *The Rainbow Cubby House* and *Koalas on Parade* , with the Nationals’ Party’s leader branding them “politically correct claptrap.” In 2005, NSW banned an anti-homophobia program used by a Western Sydney High School and in 2015 banned schools from showing *Gayby Baby* for for Wear It Purple Day.

**Popular and sucessful.** The Safe Schools program, with its goals of diversity and inclusion, was used in almost 500 schools, including those in the public, Catholic and independent sectors. Safe Schools trained more than 13,000 educators and produced the *All of Us Guide* , which contains resources and essential advice. Safe Schools is endorsed by the Australian Education Union and school principals associations as well as mental health organisations, including Beyond Blue and Headspace. [Its website](http://www.safeschoolscoalition.org.au/our-supporters/testimonials) features testimonials from schools, parents and students, including trans teens who credit the program with saving their lives.

So what happened? Why did the supposedly small “l” liberal Prime Minister whose Sydney seat includes Oxford Street — home of Sydney’s Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras — axe the popular program?

In 2005 we explained the simple recipe: “Take a handful of bigots whipped up by Fred Nile, the National Party or Family First. Send them off to the tabloid press to start screaming about the ‘homosexual propaganda,’ ‘brainwashing children at a sensitive age’ and the ‘innocence of youth.’ Wait for the headlines and watch the politicians and bureaucrats fold.” (*Freedom Socialist Bulletin* \# 33, “Schools Can Be Hell For Queer Youth: Anti Homophobia Programs are Needed in All Schools.”)

Fast forward to 2016 and it’s the Australian Christian Lobby (ACL) preaching the bigotry. ACL campaigned for two years against the program. Its parliamentary backers, South Australian Liberal Senator, Cory Bernardi, and the Nationals’ George Christensen from Far North Queensland, got backbenchers to sign a petition demanding that funding be cut.

The timing was perfect. Turnball had rolled his openly conservative predecessor, but was anxious to appease the right wing of the Coalition. Expediency came first. Like those before him, Turnbull caved into the Right by agreeing to “review” the program.

The ACL, founded in 1995, is linked to U.S. Christian fundamentalism. It is rabidly homophobic, transphobic and sexist. It is anti-choice and believes employers should be able to discriminate against those who “don’t share their ethos.” ACL supports the bigoted campaign against Halal food.

Its campaign against the program was largely stock-standard rightwing stuff, arguing that Safe Schools is “social engineering,” “rainbow ideology” and “discriminates” against heterosexual kids. There was also a new angle – bathroom panic – whipping up fear that gender non-confirming kids represent a “risk to the safety” of other students.

In record time, Safe Schools was gutted. There will be no further funding for project officers or training educators. Parental consent is required. Primary schools can’t participate, and it’s been stripped of all elements that made it an educational and affirming program for LGBTIQ and questioning kids. The bigots are horrified by the concept of gender fluidity and any discussion in schools that normalises LGBTIQ identity. But these are the vital elements that make Safe Schools an effective anti-bullying program.

The far right and its various media mouthpieces persisted with its attack, targetting Safe Schools Coalition Manager Roz Ward, who is also a long-time Marxist. This relentless campaign put pressure on Beyond Blue, which threatened to withdraw its \$600,000 funding from the program unless Ward stood down. Then La Trobe University, which auspices the program, stepped in to suspend Ward, but backed down within days in the face of a massive outpouring of criticism and strong support from the National Tertiary Education Union. It is crucial that all who support Safe Schools recognise the targetting of Ward for what it is — shameful red-baiting. Stand strong with Roz and reject this intimidation and bullying.

**Danger in parliament and on the streets.** The ACL, Bernardi, Christensen and their backers are all part of an interlinked web of far-right organising. Some are ultra-conservatives, others rightwing populists, and then there are outright fascists.

Opposition to Safe Schools and marriage equality, and promotion of the so called “natural family,” are central to the multi-issue agenda advocated by the Right. The demagogues try to whip up panic and use a wide variety of issues to promote fear. These include hysterical Islamaphobia, claims to uphold “Western values,” and advocating a discriminatory immigration policy. The Right uses the miniscule number of late-term abortions as a wedge to build a movement to restrict abortion rights. They’re looking to win support in rural communities through populist calls to support struggling dairy farmers, and they posture as patriots through crude nationalist flag-waving. They characterise demands for First Nations’ sovereignty as “apartheid” and are climate change skeptics. They advocate “small government,”which is code for cutting public services.

Bernardi, Christensen and the Coalition’s extreme right rump actively support movements which have involvement from outright fascists. Bernardi and Christensen back Reclaim Australia, resulting in the movement posting the message, “Senator Cory Bernardi, You Rock!!!” Christensen spoke at Reclaim Australia’s Easter 2015 rally in Mackay, proudly posting his speech on his website.

Bernardi is infamous for his ill-informed and inflammatory Islamophobic comments. He recently tweeted to promote the website of “neomasculinist” Daryush Valizadeh who argues that rape should be legal on private property. The Senator also refers to Safe Schools as “cultural Marxism,” a term popular with the U.S. far right and widely used by Norweigen fascist Anders Brevivik.

**Their plan ….** The far right has a clear agenda to disorient and convince the 99% that their interests reside with the 1% and to prevent people from concluding that capitalism must be replaced with socialism.

When the economy nose-dives, the outright fascists sell the politics of fear, offering scapegoats to the deprived and deranged. They are the product of capitalism, which must divide and conquer so that big business can shore up profits while the majority struggles to survive. Fascism aims to build a movement to crush the ability of the working class to resist. It uses scapegoats, such as Muslims, Jews, LGBTIQ, working women, refugees, immigrants and First Nations to divert the growing anger at the misery caused by unemployment and economic insecurity. They shred public services, strip civil liberties, militarise the police and encourage gangs of racist, fascist thugs.

**And ours!** When the far right mobilises we need a united fightback to stop them in their tracks. Huge rallies brought thousands onto the streets to defend the Safe Schools Coalition, with some of the largest in Melbourne. Brave young LGBTIQ youth, educators and union representatives spoke passionately about the importance of the program.

One important win was the temporary reprieve for some schools when the Victorian government announced it would retain the program unchanged, despite the federal government’s decision.

The weakness of the large rallies was the failure to draw the connections with the broader agenda of the program’s foes. The far right has a multi-issue agenda that connects the issues, and so must we.

Some on the far right seek election to parliament, such as the Australian Liberty Alliance. Others build street gangs wrapped in Aussie flags and claiming to be patriots, such as the True Blue Crew and the United Patriots Front.

To defeat all far right movements, the best way to is to build a united front of the disenfranchised working-class majority. This united front must be broad, democratic and have clear points of unity. We must expose the underlying political agenda of the far-right, be they ultra conservatives, rightwing populists or outright fascists, and we must prevent fascism from taking root. The assault on Safe Schools underscores that we simply cannot afford not to.

## One Nation legitimises fascist ideas! The time to stop Hansonism is now!

## DEBBIE BRENNAN

[*Freedom Socialist Organiser*](https://socialism.com/fso-article/one-nation-legitimises-fascist-ideas-the-time-to-stop-hansonism-is-now/) \|OCTOBER 2016

“I’m back — but not alone.” Pauline Hanson, leader of the extreme-right One Nation party, made a parliamentary comeback in Australia’s federal election this past July. These taunting words are from her “maiden” speech to Parliament on September 15.

In 1996 Hanson was elected to the House of Representatives, but lost her seat two years later. Back then, she said Asians were taking over the country. Twenty years later, she warns, “Now we are in danger of being swamped by Muslims”—who, she claims, will commit terror and impose sharia law.

\[Image: \]\[Image: \] April 2015: You can tell a lot about someone by their friends. Pauline Hanson addresses a Reclaim Australia rally in Brisbane.

It gets worse. As Hanson says, she’s not alone. She’s one of four newly elected One Nation Senators: two, including herself, from Queensland and the others from New South Wales and Western Australia.

Pauline Hanson and the One Nation party she formed in 1997 are notorious for their racism. In her first 1996 parliamentary speech, Hanson went on the attack against First Nations people, who, she stated, are privileged over whites. Asians were not only “swamping” Australia, they weren’t assimilating. She praised Labor Party leader, Arthur Calwell, who said in 1955: “Japan, India, Burma, Ceylon and every new African nation are fiercely anti-white and anti one another. Do we want or need any of these people here? I am one red-blooded Australian who says no and who speaks for 90 percent of Australians.”

Fast forward to 2016: Asians are replaced with Muslims. In 1996, Hanson called for a “radical review” of immigration and the abolition of multiculturalism. Today, she demands that Muslim immigration be stopped and the burqa banned.

**More than racist.** The notion of race was invented in early capitalism to justify slavery and plunder. In times of class conflict—like now—racism has been indispensable to capitalists as a weapon to split the working class and destabilise resistance. Islamophobia is that weapon now. But sexism, nationalism and anti-unionism are also instruments of control, and Hanson’s oratory is full of it.

Hanson’s close connection with men’s rights groups is reflected in One Nation’s policies. Since 1996, she has called for the scrapping of the Family Court—claiming a bias toward women who “make frivolous claims and believe they have the sole right to children.” She further blames the court for pushing non-custodial fathers into poverty and causing many to suicide. One Nation would force women to stay in miserable, often violent, relationships. Hanson instructs women to “put your differences aside, make your peace and come to agreements outside of the law courts.” If not, any woman going to court for custody better be ready to pay all costs if she loses.

She slams people on welfare, especially single mothers for “having more children just to maintain their welfare payments.” One Nation would deny payment increases to women after the first child. In Hanson’s words: “Get a job and start taking responsibility for your own actions.”

Hanson calls for an Australian identity card to access welfare, healthcare, education or any other tax-funded service, and she defies “do-gooders” to “complain about people’s privacy.”

In September, Hanson gave a thinly veiled attack on unionism when she accused “overpaid public servants” of bludging off the budget. Throughout the country, public sector workers have been in a tough three-year battle against the federal government over wages, which remain frozen, and the shredding of hard-won conditions. Community and Public Sector Union members in the Department of Immigration and Border Protection are planning another week of industrial action (See: Trans-Tasman Union Beat, page 9). The potential power that public workers hold in their collective hands is massive. This fight is historic: these unionists are taking on the State, and the government wants to crush them. No wonder the rabidly anti-union Minister for Employment Michaelia Cash hugged Hanson at the conclusion of her speech.

A former fish and chip shop owner, Hanson typifies small capitalists’ contempt for workers’ rights and hatred toward militant unionism. In a recent media interview, she said, “we need to protect the small end of town, the small contractors and subbies so that they have a chance to get jobs and not be bullied by unions.”

**The nationalist fantasy.** Hanson’s style may not be Donald Trump’s, but, like him, she appeals to prejudices to answer why life for most people has become so insecure and hard. As the global economy disintegrates and the capitalist class foists the burden onto workers and the oppressed, these far-right demagogues offer up scapegoats—served with a big dollop of nationalism.

Hanson paints Australia as expanses of farmland and infrastructure, Australian owned; a land of families, nuclear, Christian, Australian born and assimilated. The school day starts with raising the Australian flag and singing the national anthem. TVs in homes and pubs across the country show Australian athletes competing for their country and saluting the flag from the victory podium.

She condemns “foreign” capital, especially Chinese, which she says is buying up Australia’s farms, real estate and resources. These investors, she claims, put housing prices beyond Australians’ reach. She denounces big business for being behind Australia’s intake of immigrants.

The illusion she constructs is of a hardworking nation exploited by foreign capital. This idea isn’t new—fascists used it in post-World War I Germany and Italy to deflect attention from local industrialists who backed the unleashing of jackboots on a working class that was in revolt. Today, Hanson directs the attention of those attracted to her vile ideas away from the source of their problems: the global capitalist system itself.

**Understanding the threat.** Hanson’s September parliamentary speech had the eerie ring of fascism. Her inflammatory calls to strip women on welfare of their rights to independence and reproductive choice, her anti-union comments and demonisation of Muslims and immigrants are classic far-right speak. But is this fascism?

Fascism is more than a vicious ideology. It’s a movement, built to destroy the capacity of the working class to organise and revolt. Fascism’s social base is the middle class—small business people like Hanson—which, caught between the two powerful classes of capital and labour, will flip to whichever side looks likely to win over the other.

In her speech, Hanson was appealing to the middle class as well as less conscious working class folks looking for scapegoats to blame. In so doing, she legitimises fascist ideas, creating fertile ground in which a jackbooted fascist movement can take root and grow. One Nation is well positioned to coalesce the far right, inside and outside of Parliament, including neo-Nazi forces, which until now have been fragmented.

Hanson is well connected with this milieu. She has spoken at Reclaim Australia rallies. Leading members of the neo-Nazi United Patriots Front campaigned for her in the federal election. UPF even offered to be her bodyguards. Hanson is also friendly with the fascist Party for Freedom. These are the known connections.

\[Image: \]\[Image: \] Neo-Nazi thugs understand the potential to build a mass fascist movement that Hanson’s election presents.

If this leads to the cohering of a mass movement aimed at crushing the ability of the working class to organise, we’re dealing with fascism. While such a movement has not yet emerged, the danger is all too real. And Hanson is a contributor, encouraging more assaults on Muslims, immigrants, women and unionists—legislatively and physically. The need to countermobilise in our streets and communities—as we’ve done from Melbourne to Bendigo—remains urgent, because the threat could escalate.

**Build the united front.** Since Reclaim Australia first attempted to rally at Melbourne’s Federation Square in April 2015, Campaign Against Racism and Fascism (CARF) has countered these ultra-right and fascist groups whenever and wherever they’ve gathered. This united front of unionists, feminists, socialists, anarchists and Aboriginal justice activists has successfully prevented them from growing into a movement.

As the global economy continues to sink and the need to resist intensifies, a fascist movement could materialise—unless there’s a strong working class-led movement to stop it. The time to build this anti-fascist movement is right now. The CARF united front needs to grow into a force of today’s and tomorrow’s scapegoats—Muslims, women, First Nations, LGBTIQ, refugees and immigrants, unions, radicals, welfare recipients, the homeless and unemployed.

Freedom Socialist Party and Radical Women invite you to work with us in CARF.

## A call to unionists: Stand together against far-right attacks on workers

## DEBBIE BRENNAN

Across the world, the far right and neo-Nazis are not only active in the streets. They are entering parliamentary politics.

In Australia, Pauline Hanson’s extreme-right One Nation Party (ONP) made a comeback after 20 years, winning four Senate seats in the 2016 federal election. ONP is now seriously preparing for state elections in Queensland, Western Australia, New South Wales and Victoria over the next two years. Its Qld slate of 36 “initial” candidates shows a party aiming for power. The Liberal Party is so nervous that some within its ranks are pushing the party to compete for constituents by moving more rightward.

\[Image: \]\[Image: \] Many who turn out to counter the fascists, including this ETU member, are unionists. We could stop the far right in its tracks if unions collectively mobilised their members. Photo, *Freedom Socialist Organiser*.

Donald Trump’s election victory is as much a boost to the far right in Australia and across Europe as it is inside the U.S. Hanson exclaimed: “I can see in Donald Trump a lot of me and what I stand for in Australia.” Marine Le Pen, neo-Nazi contender for France’s presidency, glowingly predicted: “Donald Trump has made possible what was presented as completely impossible.” Her fascist and hard-right counterparts in Germany, Austria and the Netherlands are equally optimistic.

These developments in the electoral arena embolden the storm troopers in the streets. Hanson, for example, enjoys the staunch support of the openly fascist United Patriots Front, Party for Freedom and True Blue Crew. She has been a regular speaker at far-right Reclaim Australia rallies. Consistent anti-fascist organising has kept these groups fragmented, small and isolated. But Hanson’s ONP gives their bigoted ideas a parliamentary platform.

**This is union business.** A collapsing global economy has created the conditions for these groups to sprout and develop. Their audiences are middle and working class folks who are hurting, scared and looking for answers. The profit system is clinging to dear life, forcing workers to labour harder for less and pushing small businesses to the wall. Job security is gone, but politicians and economic “experts” say higher costs for basic needs, like food, energy and housing, are unavoidable. And workers must accept incessant budgetary slashings to indispensable services like education, welfare and healthcare. Trump, Hanson, Le Pen et al play to these insecurities and fears—blaming Muslims, “foreigners,” First Nations, independent women, queers, environmentalists, the Left and unions for the systemic chaos and cruelty. This serves capitalism well: when the working class turns on itself, it can’t unite and resist.

**Unions under fire.** Bosses want to break the union movement to prevent workers from organising in their class interest—such as defending wages, conditions and jobs, public education, healthcare and housing, and each other. The working class and the oppressed solidarising in well-organised resistance is the capitalists’ great fear.

In her parliamentary speech as a new Senator in September 2016, Pauline Hanson denounced public sector workers as overpaid bludgers living off the taxpayers. She singled them out because of their powerful three-year fight, as a union, against a wage freeze. Their boss is the Australian government, and this is the biggest industrial campaign the Community and Public Sector Union has ever waged.

Pauline Hanson’s One Nation Party is rabidly anti-union. Without ONP’s support, the Turnbull government’s union-busting Australian and Building Construction Commission (ABCC) legislation could not have passed. This law and its companion, the Registered Organisations Act, will bring union affairs under State supervision. This strikes at the heart of unionism: workers’ right to independently organise and to run their unions. ONP Senator Malcolm Roberts has since stated that his party wants the ABCC’s powers expanded to use competition laws against unions.

**Unite against racism and fascism.** Whether in Parliament or the streets, the far right and neo-Nazis have a common aim: to beat the working class into submission by smashing the union movement. The fight for unionism will be led by members and delegates. They are on the front lines of the attacks inside and outside the workplace. They’re the women, queers, First Nations, Muslims, immigrants, socialists and anarchists scapegoated for capitalism’s problems. It’s this collective power that makes unions the prime target of capitalists and their henchmen.

Campaign Against Racism and Fascism (CARF) is a united front of unionists, Left organisations, feminists and Aboriginal justice activists. CARF has been instrumental in holding back the fascists in Melbourne over the past two years. Now is a critical time for more unionists to be actively involved and stop fascists and far-right allies from mobilising a movement in Australia. Start by taking this pledge:

-   oppose racism, white supremacy, reactionary nationalism and the targeting of any people, whether for their religion, colour, sexual or gender identity or participation in organised labour; -   stand united with other unionists and anti-fascists to stop fascist and far-right movements from organising, recruiting and spreading their violent ideology; -   oppose attacks on unionists organising by Hanson’s One Nation Party and other far-right groups; -   raise the threat posed by fascism within my union, organise againts fascist groups seeking to infiltrate my union and to do what I can to push the union movement to educate about and confront the fascist menace.

## Remembering the Pink Triangle: A call for Rainbow Atheists to resist the far-right

**Alison Thorne** [*Freedom Socialist Organiser*](https://socialism.com/fso-article/remembering-the-pink-triangle-a-call-for-rainbow-atheists-to-resist-the-far-right/) \| September 2018

\[Image: \] *This talk was presented by Alison Thorne on 30 October 2018 at an event hosted by Rainbow Atheists.*

I’d like to start by acknowledging that we meet this evening on the stolen lands of the Kulin Nation. I pay my respects to elders and pledge my solidarity, not only to elders, but also to the young warriors in the struggle. I’d especially like to acknowledge inspiring First Nations elders from the LGBTIQ community such as local legend, Noel Tovey; Tiwi Island sista girl, Crystal Johnson; and feisty lesbian activist, Esther Montgomery who is a Mardudhunera woman from the Pilbara.

A hearty thanks to Rainbow Atheists for organising this very timely gathering. With “religious freedom” becoming the latest manufactured cause that rightwing forces, both inside and outside parliament, are organising around, there’s never been a better time to explore the lessons of history and to talk about what is needed to defeat the emboldened conservative, rightwing populist and outright fascist forces that are seeking to extend their influence and win recruits to their menacing agenda.

In this talk, I’ll be speaking about the far right in general — some openly fascist and some not. A grouping or political party is openly fascist when it is seeking to build a violent mass movement of the disaffected based to stopping workers and the oppressed from organising.

I thought it might be useful to share the basis of my rainbow atheism.

My working class family is from Yorkshire in England. We migrated to Australia as “10-pound poms” when I was six years old. My childhood was mostly secular, although my family were nominally Church of England and would have ticked that box on the census.

I began identifying as an atheist after I became a Marxist feminist. I embraced gay liberation in my late teens and threw myself into the movement, which in the late ’70s was awash with exciting ideas about what was needed to win our freedom.

My quest to understand the basis of homosexual oppression quickly led me to the discovery that before the rise of private property, society was matriarchal and communal, gender identity was fluid and sexuality was free. This changed gradually over generations with the rise of private property. The new economic order required its own institutions: women were enslaved in strict male-headed households comprised initially of wives, children and slaves. Religious taboos were imposed to repress residual sexual and gender diversity.

Wow, what an epiphany — the institutions that oppressed my youthful self and all my friends — the law, the church, and the stiflingly oppressive institution of the monogamous, patriarchal, heterosexual family — hadn’t always existed, and they arose alongside private property to serve the ruling class!

It was in the early ’80s, that I also first encountered two socialist feminist organisations — the Freedom Socialist Party and sister organisation, Radical Women. I was impressed by their pioneering work, including a series of articles published in the *Freedom Socialist* newspaper in the late ’70s called *Gay Resistance the Hidden History*.

This series, which was later published as a booklet, documents the Judeo-Christian taboo against homosexuality, describing how Jewish and then Christian religion “associated free sexuality with the Great Mother cults of the ancient matrilineal world, and used sexual prohibitions as a weapon against the lingering, embedded influence of matriarchal customs among the people.”

The Christians, then, “borrowed the Judaic taboo against sexual freedom and homoerotic behaviour and proceeded to extend the taboo against virtually all sexual enjoyment to a scope undreamed of by even the Hebrew patriarchs.”

The pamphlet then describes what it characterises as a “medieval holocaust” against women’s self-determination and free sexual expression, condemning all sexual activity occurring outside the sacrament of heterosexual marriage.

Once I understood the basis of my own oppression as a worker and a woman who was not heterosexual, I could not un-know what I had learnt. I joined both the Freedom Socialist Party and Radical Women in 1982 and commenced an action-packed life as a Marxist feminist. This philosophy informs every aspect of my world view.

I have a scientific materialist approach to the world, appreciating that the physical world ***precedes*** the world of ideas. I came to understand that not only Christianity, but also all religious doctrines, are idealist philosophies. So, for the last four decades I have been ticking “Atheist” on my census, which is just about the only time in predominantly secular Australia I am even asked the question.

I have titled this talk, “Remembering the Pink Triangle: A call for rainbow atheists to resist the far right,” because I firmly believe in the importance of studying history and then applying the lessons.

When we remember the pink triangle, we think first of oppression: of the chilling horror of the Nazis making homosexuals one of their scapegoats as they came to power in Germany, snuffing out all democratic rights and imposing more than 12 years of fascist rule.

But we also think of struggle as the gay liberation movement in the ’70s reclaimed the pink triangle and turned it into a symbol of queer resistance! We are reminded of how the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power (ACT-UP) adopted the inverted pink triangle along with the powerful call to arms that “silence equals death.”

While gay liberationists were marching on the streets with the Tshirts, badges, placards and banners proudly displaying the pink triangle, the movement was also part of the sweeping struggles taking place that won queer studies on campuses alongside women’s studies, Aboriginal and labour history and ethnic studies. The outpouring of writing resulted in published history that ceased describing the past from the perspective of the winners. Voices other than rich, white, heterosexual men became heard!

There was a flowering of historical discovery: evidence was re-examined and important stories painstakingly uncovered. Those who survived were inspired to tell their stories. Important memoires such as Heinz Heger’s *The Men with the Pink Triangle* packed a powerful punch.

Alongside the truth telling the horrors, a huge amount of invaluable historical work asked how and why did fascism come to power and crucially, could it have been stopped?

Studying the decades before fascism is rich with lessons. The first homosexual rights organisation in the world emerged in Germany at the end of the 19th century. For more than three decades, the Scientific Humanitarian Committee, led by Dr Magnus Hirschfield, was a key part of a large queer community with a thriving hub based in Berlin. The committee educated around sexuality, organised for homosexual rights and campaigned to repeal paragraph 175 of the German Penal Code. They gathered more than 6,000 signatures on a petition demanding the repeal of this anti-gay clause, with support coming from prominent community leaders. This organising became part of a struggle for sexual reform across Europe. The pinnacle of its success was the Bolsheviks’ removal of all laws restricting consensual sexual conduct, just two months after the October Russian Revolution. They also legalised divorce and abortion.

All this took place in a broader ***political*** context. Socialist ideas were growing in popularity, with the German Social Democratic workers’ party attracting huge numbers of members. First-wave feminism was sweeping Europe. Germany was no exception, where the movement was demanding civil rights, reproductive justice and equal education. Workers were demanding healthier living conditions in the cities, and a radical youth movement attracted thousands.

This also took place in a broader ***economic*** context. During the 1920s, the German economy was saddled with the legacy of debilitating reparations and loss of territory from the First World War. This posed significant costs, especially on heavy industry.

Ordinary people experienced unemployment, shortages and inflation. Heavy industry, keen to shore up profits, cranked out goods but, with the population squeezed, much of this production failed to find a market. Then, in the late ’20s a global financial crisis hit the already beleaguered German economy.

Fascism becomes an option for the capitalists during times of economic crisis. The big end of town needs to squeeze workers harder to make more profits. But if the movements are well organised, they’ll resist.

Faced with this situation, scapegoats come in handy to distract people from the real source of their misery. Using this approach, the far right will seek to build its own mass fascist movement. This is exactly what happened in Germany.

As first the fascist threat was small, it could have been easily stopped if all of fascism’s targets had united to stop them building a mass movement of street thugs. But this did not happen in Germany because of disastrous political errors.

While the German working class and the movements for social change were well organised, they supported two mass parties — the Social Democratic Party and the Communist Party. Tragically, the socialists believed that the constitution and the capitalist state would keep them safe from the Nazi menace, while the Communist Party made a different, but just as fatal, mistake. Stalinism dominated the communist movement and believed there was little difference between the Nazis and the socialists, who they called social fascists. The communists also failed to recognise the seriousness of the situation and refused to form a united front with the socialists.

To learn more about this period of history, I highly recommend a collection of writing by Trotsky, published as the *Struggle Against Fascism in Germany*. Trotsky, by this time in exile and living on the run from the forces of Stalinism, had a small core of supporters who argued the urgency of the socialist and communist parties working together to defeat the fascists through a united front of all who fascists seek to target.

By the time those in leadership woke up and understood that the goal of fascism is to crush working class organising and all mass movements independent of the fascist state, to put women’s reproduction under Nazi control and to snuff out democratic rights entirely, it was too late. Fascism had arrived.

That fascism in Germany resulted in a holocaust against Jews, Roma people, trade unionists, communists, homosexuals and people with disabilities is now well known. Less well known is that, with the right strategy, it could have been stopped.

So, what of today?

We are living and organising in an increasingly polarised world. The results are deadly, particularly for people of colour, including LGBTIQ people.

Far-right parties of both fascist and rightwing populist varieties are on the rise across Europe: we see this with Golden Dawn in Greece, the Sweden Democrats, the National Front in France, AfD (Alternative for Germany),, the Freedom Party in Austria and Jobbik in Hungary.

Last year, white supremacists from across the U.S. marched in Charlottesville in a Unite the Right Rally where one rammed his car into a crowd of counterprotests, killing one and injuring 19. And just this week we’ve seen Robert Bowers — a far-right, anti-Semitic, anti-immigrant man — perpetrate a mass shooting that killed 11 people in a synagogue in Pittsburg.

Indonesia is in the grip of rightwing populism with hard-line Islamist groups and the conservative politicians who back them, ramping up homophobia and transphobia. The repression is forcing people underground and leading to a rise in HIV infections, because people are too scared to access services.

In Brazil, Bolsonaro, an ultra-right candidate backed by the military, recently won the presidential race. Bolsonaro has a far-right agenda, which includes extreme homophobia. He infamously said, “I would not be incapable of loving a gay son. I prefer that he die in an accident.” This is happening in a country that is one of the most dangerous places in the world to be an LGBTIQ person, with homophobic crimes, including murders, reaching epidemic proportions. Transwomen in Brazil have a life expectancy of just 35 years!

This is the global context, while here is Australia we also have a fight on our hands.

Conservatives, rightwing populists and open neo-Nazis are also organising in Australia.

They are organising on the streets, aiming to build a mass movement. Since early 2015, when Reclaim Australia held rallies around the country, including one in Melbourne’s Federation Square, there’s been provocation after provocation through far-right and Nazi actions. There’s also been a parade of fascists, “alt-right” and other assorted nasties visiting, from Milo Yiannopolous to Lauren Southern to Nigel Farage. Meanwhile, the government stopped Chelsea Manning from visiting Australia on so-called character grounds!

Fascists paid a visit to community radio station 3CR and to the Melbourne Anarchist Club. They invaded and harassed local council meetings in the City of Yarra and Moreland after these councils spoke out against celebrating Australia Day. They’ve also disrupted rallies and harassed participants, including actions in solidarity with the Palestinian people and refugee rights.

In parliament, the right wing prevented marriage equality from being legislated long after it was well established that there was mass community support. And they succeeded in imposing the odious postal survey, which inflicted such pain on the LGBTIQ community. They’ve gutted the Safe Schools Program. And just this month we’ve seen One Nation propose a motion to denounce “anti-white racism,” based on the white supremacist slogan, “It’s OK to be white.” This initially got the backing of the Liberal Party, until they realised it wouldn’t play well in the Wentworth by-election.

The far right in Australia is globally connected and takes up the same causes. They’ll tap into any issue they think may help them build their movement. We have flag waving nationalism through to admiration for Donald Trump. They defend Australia Day, while fascists recently defaced a monument to the stolen generation. They want only the “right kind” of immigrants, generating outpourings of support for white South African farmers, while fuelling Islamophobic fear-mongering over everything from Halal food to mosques and schools. They hate feminism. They “march for the babies,” champion men’s rights and oppose the Family Court as biased in favour of women.

They lampoon political correctness as a tool to silence ordinary folk, while selectively championing free speech to spread their poison. They demand increased law-and-order measures and use xenophobia to fuel insecurity as the economy unravels. Their hysterical policing of the gender binary knows no bounds!

The latest cause celebre of the right wing is so-called “religious freedom.” Once again, this internationally connected movement is taking its cue from battles overseas, such as the U.S. wedding cake battle.

The Ruddock Review into religious freedom became a weapon for the Right to bash the LGBTIQ community, which would force limitations on the marriage equality victory. It received more than 16,500 submissions, many equating religious freedom with the right to discriminate. The task of the movement now is to get organised and make sure this tactic backfires, and does so spectacularly!

The religious exemptions to anti-discrimination protections have existed for years. While some LGBTIQ activists and feminists as well as the Independent Education Union have continued to speak out against this travesty, it was not widely known until recently. The combination of the Ruddock Review, coupled with the LGBTIQ movement finally moving on from its almost single-issue focus on marriage equality, means that this issue is now getting traction.

There’s real potential ***now*** to build on the public support, demonstrated by the marriage win, to get these odious exemptions scrapped.

LGBTIQ teachers in religious schools live in fear of being outed, causing immense stress. These exemptions are currently being used. In 2006, a divorced principal was sacked from a Catholic school for remarrying, and in 2012 a pregnant teacher was sacked from a Christian school for being unmarried.

This fight needs to link the LGBTIQ and feminist movements as well as the trade union movement.

As a socialist, I do not oppose the right of people to hold religious beliefs. The state has absolutely no business interfering. Everyone has the right to profess whatever religion they choose, and this includes the right to have no religion.

A key issue with the religious exemptions is that religious schools in Australia are publicly funded institutions. As we campaign for the full repeal of all religious exemptions, we should also be educating about the need for the separation of church and state. Religious influence must be removed from all public institutions, and the state must immediately stop funding ***all*** religious organisations!

This talk is a call for Rainbow Atheists to fire up and resist the far right.

First and foremost, everyone who is concerned about these issues needs get active — resisting the far right is not something that can be delegated to someone else. We ***all*** have a role in it.

We’re also vastly more effective when we join an organisation that shares our perspective, so that we can campaign collectively. This boosts our efforts! It would be great to see Rainbow Atheists move from being a Facebook group into being an activist group — there’s certainly no shortage of things to do.

For those interested in finding out more about socialist feminism, check out the Freedom Socialist Party, starting with our publications the *Freedom Socialist* and *Freedom Socialist Organiser*. We welcome those who would like to know more to join one of our study groups, to work with us in the movements and, if you agree, we’d invite you to join.

We also need to absorb those lessons from German history and apply them to Australia today. Neo-Nazis are organising and they cannot be ignored or simply dismissed as a joke. Those like the Freedom Socialist Party and Radical Women, who have been countering fascists grouplets, have kept them small. But they are not defeated, and they are just looking for that spark to build a mass fascist movement.

We’re working as part of a group called PUSH! Organising and Educating to Build a United Front against Fascism. PUSH is a nucleus seeking to build a united front of all of fascism’s targets that is democratic, disciplined, accountable and effective. It would be great to have Rainbow Atheists come on board. Check out the PUSH call to action and get in touch to become involved.

History tells us that there is way too much at stake. Don’t sit on the sidelines — the time to get active is now!

## Beware! Decades of hard-fought reforms under threat from Religious Freedom Bill

## ALISON THORNE

[*Freedom Socialist Organiser*](https://socialism.com/fso-article/beware-decades-of-hard-fought-reforms-under-threat-from-religious-freedom-bill/) \|SEPTEMBER 2021

“I don’t expect any reform to last longer than the willingness of people to fight to retain it and longer than a progressive period in history will last,” said Clara Fraser. She was acutely aware that under capitalism, as soon as any progressive reform is won, those who opposed the change would be organising to overturn it. Although Fraser, who co-founded both Radical Women and the Freedom Socialist Party, died in 1998 she could have been talking about the backlash that commenced the moment the Australian Parliament conceded to popular demand and legislated same-sex marriage equality in December 2017. As we argued then (See: *FSO* editorial — [How to make change: generations of campaigners win marriage equality](https://socialism.com/fso-article/make-change-generations-campaigners-win-marriage-equality/), January 2018), the battle for marriage equality was hard-fought and finally achieved by more than half a century of mass struggle. We also noted that another battle loomed, because reforms are never stable.

**Concession to the losers.** In 2004, conservative Prime Minister John Howard imposed a ban on same-sex marriage. Opposition to the ban became the focus of a lengthy national campaign, which put down deep roots in workplaces, schools and communities. For 13 years, as support blossomed, both the Coalition and Labor pandered to the conservative minority, stubbornly refusing to back equality. Their battle plan was a gamble that growing support could be quashed through an ugly and divisive marriage equality plebiscite. Anti-marriage equality advocates pumped out homophobic and transphobic fear mongering, bigotry and bile. They lost, with almost 62% voting yes. Since its legislation, support for same-sex marriage rose to 75% by 2019, with significantly higher backing among young people.

Opponents howled that marriage is a religious institution, claiming the changes impinge on their “religious freedom.” This is despite the fact that 80% of marriages are secular. With the public vote finalised, the government still had to get the change legislated. As a concession to the most reactionary forces in parliament, it announced an enquiry into religious freedom conducted by Phillip Ruddock. This prominent conservative finalised his review in May 2018. The explosive recommendations were kept under close wraps but leaked in the middle of a by-election in inner Sydney’s secular and queer friendly Wentworth electorate. Among them were greater powers to religious schools to expel students and fire teachers on the basis of their sexuality, gender identity or relationship status.

Current Prime Minister Scott Morrison is a conservative Pentecostal Christian who trumpets his religious beliefs. He went to the last election promising to legislate religious freedom. Two attempts have stalled, both failing to win support. Feminists, socialists, unionists who work in religious institutions, secular people and the LGBTIQA+ community were scathing of the proposed law which would entrench religious *privilege*. Conservative Christian groups, such as the Australian Christian Lobby (ACL) and Freedom for Faith (FFF), the main advocates for the change, say it does not go far enough!

With a federal election looming, the Morrison government has put religious freedom back on the political agenda with a new draft to be introduced by December.

**Is there a gap?** The government will try to package its plan as being about fairness and not discriminating against others. In reality, it is anything but.

When it comes to religious discrimination, there’s little evidence that Christians face any. In contrast, Muslims face widespread prejudice. A report by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission released in July found that 80% of Muslims had experienced discrimination based on religion, race or ethnicity. Sexism compounds the targeting of Muslim women.

It is *already* against the law to discriminate against someone because of their religion in all states and territories, except New South Wales and South Australia. These states should follow suit.

While not an instant panacea, these laws are a useful tool for those facing systemic Islamophobia. They can be used as a tactic to strengthen the necessary collective resistance, and build broad community support to challenge the entrenched harassment that many face.

Existing laws also need changing to immediately scrap the many exemptions in place, which allow for organisations run by religious institutions, such as schools, hospitals and aged care, to discriminate. These exemptions make life hell for queers, feminists, de facto couples, divorcees and single parents, many of whom are forced to be secretive about who they are when they’re at work.

Campaigners for “religious freedom” laws will *not* be satisfied once every jurisdiction includes religious belief. They are not interested in anti-discrimination law. They want *special* treatment.

**A far-right battering ram.** Those driving the push for a Religious Freedom Bill demand measures they can use to impose their conservative world view on the entire community.

This noisy and dangerous minority are rightwing Christians, who have also been flocking to the ranks of the Liberal National Party Coalition. Key proponents are the ACL and FFF. Both are anti-choice and support conversion therapy. The former has been treated as a “peak body” for Christians since it won the backing of John Howard. In reality it represents a small, mostly Pentecostal wing of Christianity. FFF is a conservative Christian Think Tank. It opposes allowing the increasingly secular population to answer “no religion” on the Census and is hostile toward the work of the Safe Schools Coalition to stop kids being the target of homophobic and transphobic bullying.

What’s at stake is the introduction of legislation that gives conservatives the unfettered right to bully, harass and discriminate under the cover of “religious freedom.” Such measures would override health and safety legislation, which requires employers to keep workplaces free from bullying and harassment. It would operate as a trump card to override anti-discrimination laws won through decades of struggle.

Legislation which advantages religious beliefs *above all others* are widespread in the U.S. and have been used to wind back reproductive health and equality measures. This tactic has paid off to the point where there is a very real possibility that *Roe v. Wade,* the landmark case which legalised abortion throughout the country, may be overturned.

Religious freedom laws could be used to defend violence against women on the grounds that the Bible tells wives to submit to their husbands. They could be used by a worker to refuse to report to a female supervisor, because the Bible says no woman should have authority over a man. A pharmacist in a small country town could claim religious freedom to refuse to dispense puberty blockers or hormone therapy to a transgender person. The only GP in a remote community could decline to prescribe contraception to a single woman, because they believe sex outside of marriage is a sin. A doctor could refuse to refer a patient with a disability wanting advice about specialist stem cell treatment. Religious bigots and bullies will be given a green light to spew hatred in every workplace in the country.

**Religion is big business.** The rights of huge sections of the workforce are at even greater risk if their bosses are given more rights than they now have under the current “exemptions” regime. The spree of privatisation and outsourcing, which gathered pace in the 1980s and hasn’t slowed, exacerbates the problem. Swathes of services as diverse as job network providers through to disability services, all once provided by the public sector, have been outsourced to religious institutions. A massive 40% of all aged care facilities are now run by religious organisations and charities. Even the provision of the largest so-called “state-run” COVID-19 vaccination centres are in reality outsourced to a religious institution.

Healthcare unions and the Australian Medical Association are concerned that established standards and ethical frameworks, which underpin healthcare roles, are at risk. For example, the Medical Board Code of Conduct specifies that doctors have a duty to make the care of patients their *first* concern. Healthcare workers could face reprisals if their ethical responsibility is at odds with requirements mandated by their employer on religious freedom grounds.

**\[Image: \]\[Image: \]A call to action.** The good news is that public opinion is firmly on the side of maintaining all the rights that implementing a Religious Freedom Bill would take away. Even those who hold religious beliefs are likely to disagree with clerics on issues such as abortion, contraception, voluntary assisted dying and marriage equality. For example, only 15% of Catholics oppose a woman’s right to choose. There’s widespread support to scrap religious exemptions, with 79% of the community *opposed* to religious schools being able to dismiss teachers on the grounds of their sexuality and relationships.

This passive support must be actively *mobilised* , just as it was to win marriage equality. For years, despite opinion polls, both the Coalition and Labor stonewalled on legislating equality. Today, the toxic push for “religious freedom” comes from within the Coalition ranks. Meanwhile, in the lead-up to the next election, Labor is scared to stand for anything much.

What’s needed is to forge a broad, democratic and feminist united front — with trade unions playing a pivotal role — to activate the majority threatened by the government’s plan. The immediate goal must be *both* to stop the Religious Freedom Bill and to eliminate the religious exemptions from *current* anti-discrimination measures.

It is crucial to emphasise that the intention of the bill is to give the far right a powerful tool to dismantle decades of progressive reforms won by feminists, LGBTIQA+ liberationists, unionists, socialists and civil libertarians.

In the spirit of Clara Fraser, Radical Women member Amelia Kirk-Harkin drew support when she recently posted an impassioned appeal on *TikTok* , proclaiming, “Fear mongering is a favoured practice of the far right. For every gain we make, there is a backlash. When marriage equality was won, the government retaliated, pledging a Religious Freedom Bill. Make no mistake, this is not about religious freedom — it is about the right to discriminate. I am sick of this tug of war, fighting to hang on to rights. I feel that we simply need a revolution.”

## Now is the time for a united self-defence against the far-right “freedom” movement

## DEBBIE BRENNAN AND MAUDIE OSBORNE

[*Freedom Socialist Organiser*](https://socialism.com/fso-article/now-is-the-time-for-a-united-self-defence-against-the-far-right-freedom-movement/) \| JANUARY 2022

Calling itself a “freedom movement,” the far right is on the attack, allegedly against dictatorial governments. But its actual targets have been unions, the Left and selected small businesses. Since September last year, anti-vaxxers mobbed the Melbourne office of the Construction, Forestry, Mining, Maritime and Energy Union (CFMMEU), tried breaking into the home of prominent Sydney-based socialist and unionist Paddy Gibson and vandalised the front window of Freedom Socialist Party and Radical Women’s organising centre, Solidarity Salon. They left a death threat at a Thornbury café, after smashing its frontage, as a warning against following COVID safety protocols. They’ve assaulted workers in health, retail, transport and media. They have infiltrated the First Nations movement to try turning this radical and growing resistance against itself. And they are setting up bogus unions, using opposition to mandatory vaccination as a recruiting tool.

Dressed up as the champion “of the people,” the movement has been gaining momentum in Australia since COVID began. Eighteen months of lockdowns made Victoria its epicentre. By mid 2021, shadowy groups were using social media to galvanise people into Melbourne’s streets. Through repeated organised protest, the “freedom movement” grew. Among QAnon symbols and slogans, Trump supporters and Australian flags are known far-right agitators and fascists.

Things came to a head when the Victorian government mandated vaccination for the construction industry in September. “Freedom” protesters and CFMMEU members not associated with them converged outside the union headquarters for a turbulent rally. Lockdown and vaccination mandates became the movement’s rallying point.

**Another pandemic to squelch.** The far right works like an opportunistic, lethal virus. It latches onto people whose defences against crisis are low. It feeds on helpless desperation and rage. Today’s conditions have been perfect for its rapid spread.

In Australia, it’s preying on the anger and hurt caused by governments’ handling of the COVID catastrophe. The chaotic vaccination rollout, fraught with secret commercial deals and profiteering; First Nations communities, prisoners, people with disabilities and workers on visas left exposed; the militarised and heavy policing directed at poor communities and protesters; snap-backs of childcare and job supports contrasted to generous handouts to corporate business are just some reasons people don’t trust government.

The far right skilfully crafts its rhetoric to draw in diverse groups of people desperate for answers. Stealing the language of movements for real justice, it sprinkles bizarre conspiracy theories with words, like “segregation,” “apartheid” and “sovereignty” to co-opt and destroy strong movements. “My body, my choice” and “Freedom” are its rallying cries.

COVID may be destabilising the profit economy, but this far-right movement is being built to rescue it. The money trail leads to big backers, the likes of Charles Koch in the U.S. and Clive Palmer in Australia, and a tangled web of “dark money.” Its real “freedom” agenda is to save big capital.

Far-right populism is not a fascist movement, but it could grow into one. Fascism is the ultimate weapon of capital to annihilate its nemesis — the working class — when it’s ready to revolt. So, we have to stop this “freedom” movement now. The question is how.

**Only a working class-led united front can do this.** History is rich with inspiring defeats of far-right and fascist attempts to gain a foothold. Melbourne’s northern suburbs of Brunswick and Fawkner are just a couple of examples, which Freedom Socialist Party and Radical Women are proud to have been a part of. Through sustained, united organising, these working class, multicultural communities have expelled Nazis whenever they’ve shown their faces.

Past experience provides crucial lessons for combating the far right today. One is that we have to take it on: ignoring it, as out-of-touch sideliners like to advise, will not make it go away. Another is that organising ***on the ground*** is essential. We can’t turn to leaders in government or institutions of the capitalist state for protection: their role is to protect profit and property, not us. This is why Victorian Trades Hall’s call for a royal commission into far-right violence is badly mistaken. Ask CFMMEU rank-and-file veterans of state harassment or First Nations’ people who are still battling to end deaths in custody! Only the targets of far-right violence — unionists, radicals, women, LGBTIQ, people with disability, First Nations, immigrants of colour and people who are homeless — can do this!

This unity in action must be democratic. Campaign Against Racism and Fascism (CARF) initiated counter-protest against the “freedom movement.” But it is controlling all aspects of the organising. From the lack of information for ralliers about march details to “speakouts” without an open mic, people ready to act are treated like numbers of sheep. Criticism is not tolerated, as an activist found out when marshals threw her out of the march and into the arms of the cops: she had criticised CARF’s blanket denunciation of those attracted to the “freedom movement” as fascist. This is not how a thriving movement is built, especially one capable of trouncing the far right. Sectarianism — an organisation placing itself above the movement — holds back the class struggle.

Su Docekal, from the Freedom Socialist Party in Seattle, captures the essentials for building the kind of movement needed. After a huge Seattle demonstration against the far right, following the anti-fascist demo in Charlottesville, Virginia, she said: “The way to prevent fascism from taking root is through direct action and disciplined counter-demonstrations when they come out to recruit. Our goal is to build a broad, democratic united front to stop them in their tracks.”

*Freedom Socialist* author, Monica Hill, draws on the party’s experience in the United Front Against Fascism, which stopped Nazis from turning the Pacific Northwest into an Aryan homeland in the 1980s. Hill stresses that the union movement’s involvement is pivotal: “When capitalism takes the fascist route, it does so in a last-ditch bid to survive in a time of crisis by obliterating all working-class organizations. And, if labor leaders do more than just endorse the fight on paper, they can bring disciplined strength in critical numbers to the battle.”

Recently in Italy, we got a glimpse of what the union movement is capable of. In October last year, when hundreds of fascists attacked the Rome headquarters of the Italian General Confederation of Labour (CGIL), over issues similar to anti-vaxxers’ assault on the CFMMEU, at least 100,000 from across unions and movements answered the CGIL’s call to take the streets. Hit by the brutalities of COVID, and now a fascist assault on the union movement, they united around the slogan, “No to fascism and violence, yes to work, safety and rights.”

**Let’s do it.** Imagine hundreds of thousands of unionists and communities answering a union callout to stand up to these “freedom” protests. Imagine a united front of unions, left organisations, community groups and anyone else committed to fight — brought together on agreed principles and working in serious, democratic collaboration. It requires a bold platform, clear in what it stands for and what it opposes. Such a program should prioritise mutual defence against assaults by the far right: no one, no café or organisation should have to fend for themself alone. The union principle, “touch one, touch all!,” demonstrates this strength.

Also important is engagement in the war of ideas. A key weapon against the far right is solutions, which these hawkers of “freedom” don’t have. Just some examples are job security and equal pay for comparable work so that no type of work is expendable; workers collectively determining safety in their workplaces; a liveable income for everyone, free from coercive restrictions; removing vaccine patents from the control of pharmaceutical giants; recognising that the pandemic can only be solved through global, internationally coordinated vaccination stripped of profit interests. Real, concrete answers such as these may win over some who have stumbled into the far-right camp. They would certainly galvanise the most clear-sighted to strike a powerful blow against capitalism.

Collaborative unity would be a welcome antidote to the dispiriting, distressing isolation of this COVID crisis. There is nothing like the feeling of collective power in working toward overcoming ***both*** pandemics. And there is no time like now!

## COVID, capitalism and the far-right threat: Frontline workers speak out

[*Freedom Socialist Organiser*](https://socialism.com/fso-article/covid-capitalism-and-the-far-right-threat-frontline-workers-speak-out/) \| APRIL 2022

By the end of 2021, a far right disguised as a “freedom movement” was on the rise in Australia. With Melbourne the most locked down city in the world, Victoria became the epicentre. The movement preys on people’s fears and their justifiable anger at governments’ pro-business, law-and-order measures, which have caused intolerable misery for workers and marginalised communities.

Answering a callout from the Workers Solidarity group, unionists, First Nations campaigners, leftists and feminists, including Freedom Socialist Party and Radical Women, came together to begin building a fightback. United in agreement that stopping the far right requires grassroots, working class solutions to the COVID crisis, the coalition held a rally on 19 March, titled Fight for Public Health and Workplace Safety, with these demands:

1.  a living income for everyone – end casualisation, paid pandemic income support for everyone

2.  free healthcare for everyone – free RAT tests, more nurses, fully fund hospitals, full access to PPE

3.  Secure housing for everyone: massively expand public housing; stop the selloffs; moratorium on evictions

4.  Right to organise: • right to organise and strike any time • repeal secondary boycott laws

5.  Roll back police powers, drop the COVID fines

6.  COVID health and safety for all workers in all industries, especially in frontline healthcare

7.  A global solution to the pandemic – remove patents from COVID vaccines and provide free to all countries

Speakers came from the front lines of the COVID crisis, including those directly threatened by the far right.

Below are the speeches of retail worker, **Maudie Osborne** , and public health worker, **Nita Okoko**.

**Maudie Osborne** is a young retail worker and, as a member of the Retail and Fast Food Workers Union (RAFFWU), she has fought for COVID safety in her workplace. Maudie is also a member of Radical Women.

“My name is Maudie, and I stand here before you today to say that every worker is entitled to having their health protected and their safety guaranteed in the workplace.

Throughout the pandemic, I’ve worked for JB Hi-Fi, a multi-million dollar company that has turned over profit tenfold over the last two years. During the initial lockdown in March 2020, the then CEO of the company declared that, as an “essential service,” JB Hi-Fi would not be closing its doors to the public. As the virus continued to rage, many of my co-workers were scared. We were scared for the health of ourselves and our families, and we were terrified of contracting the virus at work.

As soon as JB Hi-Fi announced it would remain open — with no supply of PPE, no masks, no hand sanitiser, no cleaning products in sight — we contacted our union, the Retail and Fast Food Workers Union, to organise a petition of demands around health and safety. We were not an essential service, and the stores had to be closed to protect the health and safety of the staff working there. Over 1,000 JB Hi-Fi workers signed the petition, and the campaign was a success. Not only did we win our demands for the anti-infection protection we needed, we drew more workers into the union. It showed us that there is strength in numbers and that we overworked, minimum wage workers have the power to take on a multi-million dollar company — whose primary concern is making a profit, not looking after the staff, who actually make their money for them.

The treatment of retail and hospitality workers throughout this pandemic has been disgusting. We have been the victims of far-right violence, just for doing our job. At one of the retail venues I work at, we had someone send us messages over Facebook, threatening arson — all because we were complying with government-required QR codes to track COVID contact. A Dymocks bookstore worker was thrown down an escalator, just a few blocks from here. Shame!

It’s bad enough that we are subjected to wage theft and abuse from our bosses. We now have to also fight off a movement that beats up and terrorises workers — allegedly in the name of a false “freedom.” Some of them are gathering down the road right now.

If there is anything this pandemic has shown us, it is the utter failure of capitalism. Our state and federal governments’ responses to the COVID-19 crisis reflect this. Judging from the increase of case numbers and the fatalities from the virus, our politicians care more about our productivity than our health. In fact, they’ve recently cut paid pandemic sick leave to casual workers, meaning that if we become sick with COVID, we have no financial support for the duration of time that we are unwell. Do they honestly want us to return to work sick, with an airborne virus that becomes seven times more infectious with each new variant?

The pandemic has also exposed the problems of a casualised workforce. Millions were left unemployed and jobless at the beginning of the pandemic, where their only source of income became the Jobkeeper and Jobseeker COVID Supplement payments. These were fundamental in keeping workers’ lives afloat when everything was so uncertain. Now, the federal government has scrapped Jobkeeper and slashed the Jobseeker rate. It is not enough money for people to survive on. Public money — workers taxes! — should be going towards things like increasing Centrelink payments, not huge subsidies to profiteers or more policing! We should demand that everyone have a liveable income — permanently!

We must keep organising hard around workplace safety, around wages, around our right to strike and for a better world beyond this pandemic. We ***have*** the power to do this! We all saw what happened when the tidal wave that was Omicron hit our shores early this year. Entire workplaces have shut down and the supply chain stretched to the point of collapse. This was because workers all got sick and could not work. It showed that this profit economy cannot function without us! Let’s use this power: Demand free access to PPE in all workplaces, pandemic sick leave on full pay, the end to casualisation, massive increases in our wages and a guaranteed liveable income. How about free early education and childcare, not for a month, but for good! Let’s demand publicly owned and run vaccine facilities and a fully funded, state-of-the-art public healthcare system — controlled by health workers!

We want a better, humane system that addresses the needs of ***all*** of us who are exploited and abused. And we need to fight for it!”

**Nita Okoko** is a public health worker and unionist, who migrated from Kenya. Currently working in a COVID contact centre, she is a member of the Community and Public Sector Union.

“The COVID pandemic has exposed fractures in the management of the health workforce globally.

From the beginning of the pandemic, health workers and their families have been greatly affected worldwide.

Those at the frontlines providing care have faced extreme overwork. In my country, Kenya, multiple back-to-back shifts, overtime and huge patient loads have become the norm. Indeed, this is the case in many countries, including Australia.

Health workers have also faced significant trauma, with many suffering from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), after witnessing so much death and devastation first hand.

I personally know very many health workers who are unable to walk into a hospital anymore without feeling triggered. They are now seeking employment in other sectors, because they cannot cope with the gruelling work conditions and lack of support that they have received during the pandemic.

Healthcare workers have also been exposed to COVID infection, which has put them, along with their families, at the risk of death and debilitation. Indeed, too many health workers have already been lost to COVID.

So it’s not surprising, then, that many health workers are now leaving their jobs. They are leaving their livelihoods and passions behind. This is a last resort for many of them.

This trajectory of untenable work conditions is continuing, with healthcare workers being susceptible to multiple re-infections with COVID. Now here in Australia, healthcare workers are currently being expected to work while they are close contacts. This completely defeats the logic of controlling COVID, while devaluing the wellbeing of frontline workers and their families.

The COVID pandemic has exposed fractures in the public health systems worldwide, and certainly here, too, in Australia. Public health systems have been fragmented and underfunded for decades, and healthcare has been turned into an expensive commodity — provided by private corporations for mega-profits and accessible only to the rich.

We, the public, pay for vaccine and health research through our taxes, only to have to buy it back from corporations like pharmaceutical companies and private hospitals. Why are we paying twice for the right to health?

Efforts to remedy these gaps in light of the COVID pandemic have not gone far enough.

As public health advocates and unionists, our demands are as follows:

1.  Free, full vaccination, including boosters, of the frontline health workforce must be provided globally. This includes all heathcare workers, aged care workers, disability workers and carers.

Pharmaceutical companies must stop profiteering from the vaccines, and rich countries like Australia must not hoard vaccines at the expense of low-income countries. Only one in 10 people have received a single dose of the vaccine in Africa, for example, while in other counties four doses have become routine. This vaccine hoarding will only encourage the rise of new COVID variants, which know no borders

Vaccine manufacturing companies must be publicly owned and run by the people for the people. The research that has gone into making the COVID vaccine must not be patented but rather be shared, for the sake of all workers worldwide.

2.  Governments everywhere must continue COVID control measures to protect those most at risk as well as the more vulnerable. This must include paid pandemic leave for the quarantine of health workers who have been exposed to COVID.

3.  We, as unionists, demand the provision of safe working conditions, including PPE and reasonable working hours with sufficient staffing and sufficient breaks, and paid leave. Job security for health workers must be guaranteed.

4.  Free and comprehensive mental health support must be provided for health workers working at the coalface of the pandemic. Many workers have experienced burnout and PTSD over the course of the last two years — this is ongoing.

5.  As unionists, we demand that healthcare and COVID vaccines be publicly owned and run by the workers, whose research and labour provide them. Healthcare must be publicly funded and accessible to all!

We need ***global*** solutions to solve this ***global*** problem!!”

## International Anti-Fascist Conference: A Lost Opportunity to Build Solidarity

## LUMA NICHOL

[*Freedom Socialist Bulletin*](https://socialism.com/fsb-article/international-anti-fascist-conference-a-lost-opportunity-to-build-solidarity/) \| SUMMER/AUTUMN 1998 \| Issue 18

In the ’80s and early ’90s, the shocking resurgence of fascism in Europe was marked by jackbooted racist skinheads, marches of uniformed “seig-heiling” Hitlerites and the torching of Turkish refugee residences. Now the fascists are forming parties like Austria’s Freedom Party, Italy’s National Alliance and Belgium’s Vlaams Blok and are heading for the ballot box.

This shift in strategy promoted Britain’s Anti-Fascist Action (AFA) to call an International Militant Anti-Fascist Conference in London from October 2 to 5. The stated goal of the conference was to form an international network of militants to counter the fascists and oppose the doomed liberal approach of ignoring or caving in to the far right. Unfortunately, the anti-communism sweeping Europe has disoriented some anti-fascist groups. The opportunity to discuss ways of building a powerful international anti-fascist movement was lost.

**Fascism in Europe today.** The revival of fascism around the world is sparked by capitalist economic crisis. Preserving profits in the era of inflation and stock market crashes demands lowering the living standards of the working class. Fascism is big business’ brutal trump card. Le Pen and his ilk are used by the ruling class to brutalize and terrorize working people. It is no coincidence that members of Italy’s National Alliance were first given government posts as part of billionaire Berlusconi’s coalition in 1994. Today, they have the backing of 15% of the electorate.

The ultimate goal of fascism is to crush the workers’ movement and to eradicate all democratic rights. For this the fascists need a mass movement. Entering European elections has given them an ostensible legitimacy and following that Nazi marches and skinhead brutality cannot produce. Yet to mobilize their base of support – the middle class – they need an issue that taps into the deep insecurity and anger of this constituency. In the current period, that issue is: immigration.

With the highest unemployment rate since the Nazi era and 20 million migrants in Europe, xenophobia is running rampant. Fuelled by the rhetoric of the extreme right, vicious attacks on the people of color and refugees have skyrocketed, even in countries like Scotland and Denmark. The extreme right sees immigrant bashing as its ticket to power.

In response to the new fascist populism, mainstream parties have jumped on the racist bandwagon to enact a plethora of anti-immigration legislation.

**The fall of the USSR: a boost for the far right.** The crumbling of the Eastern Bloc had a profound effect on Europe. Despite its betrayals of the world working class, the Soviet Union acted as a check on rampaging capitalism. With the fall of the USSR came economic and political chaos. In the former Eastern Bloc countries, fascist gangs resurfaced. In Western Europe, demoralization and disorientation set in as Stalinism was discredited, severely weakening Communist Parties such as the French CP, which had commanded 28% of the electorate. So-called progressives like Britain’s Labour Party leader Tony Blair took a hard right turn.

In this post Cold War confusion, the fascists raised the flag of nationalism and began to win elections. In France, Jean-Marie Le Pen’s National Front now governs four municipalities in the South. Fascist officials in these cities have launched a cultural war against progressive ideas. Their reactionary activities include banning books from public libraries, closing counter- culture cafés catering to progressive youth and cancelling funding from a movies series about AIDS.

The extreme right electoral advance and the treacherous liberal response demand a strong answer from anti-fascist forces.

**Dangerous disorientation in the anti-fascist movement.** The disorientation among some anti-fascist groups is alarming. AFA and similar group blame the resurgence of fascism on the failures of the “old Left,” rather than on capitalism. AFA refuses to work with the Left and accuses it of “caving in” to fascists. It ignores the success of groups like France’s Ras l’Front, a Trotskyist-led united front, which staged an anti-National Front protest that drew 70,000, instead resorting to virulent red-baiting as a substitute for political debate. This is an extremely dangerous course, which is dividing and weakening the movement.

Coupled with AFA’s sectarianism is sexism: both prevent the group from building vital alliances with communities directly targeted by violence. Tellingly, the conference did not seek out representation from the Jewish, immigrant, feminist, labor, lesbian/gay, or Romani (Gypsy) movements. Yet these are the very groups that will provide the leadership of an effective groundswell of protest.

Of all places in the world, it is in Europe that activists must know where this kind of sectarianism leads. AFA’s policies parallel the disastrous stance of the Communist Party of Germany (CPG) in the ’30s. The leadership of the CPG also blamed the “old Left” – in their case, the leaders of the Social Democratic Party – for the rise of Nazism. Their refusal to organize a united front between Communists and Social Democrats led directly to Hitler’s seizure of power and all that followed.

To counter a far-right mass mobilization, anti-fascists must build a broad movement that educates about the fascist threat and its roots in the decaying economic structure. Luckily, many of the other conference participants, who represented groups from Western Europe, Canada and the U.S., are working along these lines.

Young feminist, gay rights anarchists in Scandinavia have built a powerful network that allies itself with the Left and others to successfully close Nazi bookstores and counter the ultra-right. In Germany, the numerous groups are linked in three networks. They work with Turkish Communists, the Autonome youth movement, students, bikers, and many others to stage protests, publish newsletters, and sponsor coffee houses in order to mobilize opposition.

**The fight is just beginning.** As militants, conference participants were clear that non-confrontation of the “fash” is dangerous and that reliance on bourgeois governments to halt Nazism is deadly. But AFA’s sectarianism derailed real debate. It would have been valuable, for example, to strategise with international activists around issues such as:

-   How to promote the participation of trade unions as the backbone of the movement, -   How to respond to the massive number of cruel hate crimes, since laws and the police can’t and won’t address the problem, -   How to prevent the media and ultra-cautious liberals from isolating and marginalizing activists as “extremists” or “alarmists.”

Despite its failure, the conference demonstrated that the battle to stop fascism is on. This fight is galvanizing young people, anti-racists and workers the world over. The winning strategy depends on the ability to forge solidarity. To succeed, fascism must conquer the working class completely. It *must* not be permitted to do this and it *will* not.

An international campaign by trade unionists, civil rights activists, leaders of many different oppressed social sectors and ordinary people of every description is what’s needed. Allied to protect our rights and livelihood and to uplift the human condition, such a united front can demoralize, demobilize and destroy the peddlers of degradation and tyranny!

## The high price of ignoring teenage fascists

## GUERRY HODDERSEN

[*Freedom Socialist Bulletin*](https://socialism.com/fsb-article/dateline-u-s-a-the-high-price-of-ignoring-teenage-fascists/) \| WINTER/SPRING 1999 \| Issue 21

On the 110th anniversary of Hitler’s birthday, twelve Littleton, Colorado high-school students and one teacher died in a hail of automatic gunfire and shrapnel from homemade bombs. Their executioners were their classmates and neighbours, Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris.

Within hours of the shooting, the national media descended on Littleton, a suburb of Denver, and attempted to answer the question: how did this tragedy happen? An evolving portrait of the killers emerged on TV and in newspapers over the next two weeks.

At first, they were described as intelligent, hardworking, relatively law- abiding computer nerds. Soon a more sinister picture emerged.

The boys were “misfits,” leaders of a Trenchcoat Mafia that listened to German rock music and hated jocks and people of colour. They wore clothes with Nazi insignia. They made death threats to other students. Klebold kept a diary filled with racist, anti-Semitic and Nazi references.

And they singled out Isaiah Shoels, an African American athlete, and shot him in the face during their murderous rampage at the school. They also picked out Kyle Velasquez for execution.

TV commentators urged the public to listen to their children and to learn how to recognise the warning signs of psychiatric illnesses in teenagers. President Clinton and the organisation Ceasefire renewed their calls for gun control. Preachers exhorted parents to “take responsibility” for their families. School administrators considered outlawing trenchcoats.

Lost in the rush for quick fixes is the realisation that the teenaged killers in Littleton, Colorado had a ***political illness*** , not a psychiatric one. They were adolescent fascists, set on the path to destruction by a well-funded international ***adult*** movement.

**Nazis target alienated youth for recruitment.** The rampage by the teenaged killers in Littleton was not the first of its kind.

In 1980, a youth named Gundolf Kohler walked into an Oktoberfest beer garden in Munich and detonated a bomb that killed dozens of people and injured more than 200. Kohler was a member of the Hoffman Militia, a German version of the survivalist militias in the U.S.

In 1992, two young Nazi skinheads firebombed the home of a Turkish family in Molin, Germany. Two children and their grandmother died in the blaze. The youthful killers in this case had been in contact with an American neo-Nazi group.

After the Molin deaths, Ingo Hasselbach, a former Nazi recruiter in eastern Germany, renounced white supremacism. He wrote in the *New York Times* (April 26, 1995), “Extremist groups in America and Europe create a climate through printed propaganda and computer networks that encourage young people who might be antisocial to go over the edge and commit violent acts…The rightwing… movement is a loose network of people with a great deal of hatred and potential for violence, and all over the world they are constantly exchanging information. Indoctrination is a slow, careful process, in which leaders like I used to be incite newcomers step-by-step.”

Klebold and Harris must be seen in a larger social framework than that provided by their family histories, school problems or wardrobe preferences. They were the ideal cannon fodder for grown-up Nazis.

Scapegoated and abused at their high school, they looked, consciously or unconsciously, for an ideology that put them on top, that gave them power. And they found it in neo-Nazi German rock music and the ideology of white supremacy. Klebold, whose great-grandfather was Jewish, separated himself from this heritage in his embittered need to be ***superior to someone.***

**Colorado’s history of ultra-right violence.** These are not the first politically motivated murders in Colorado.

In 1984, Alan Berg, a Jewish talk-show host, was gunned down outside his home by members of The Order of the Silent Brotherhood, an Aryan Nations offshoot. In 1997, over a one-week period, racist Denver skinheads executed an African immigrant at a bus stop, shot and paralysed a nurse who came to his aid, and also ambushed and killed a policeman.

Among the far-right groups and spokespeople who call Colorado home are:

-   The Coors family which bankrolls National Empowerment Television, whose director William Lind has noted, “If we are going to rescue our culture, we need a lot more hate.” -   Focus on the Family, which played a major role in the passage of Amendment 2, a state anti-gay law. -   The Posse Comitatus whose members were arrested in 1982 for conspiring to kill two federal judges and to blow-up the Internal Revenue Service building in Denver. \* Pete Peters, a Christian Identity radio preacher, who is credited with launching the U.S. militia movement in the 1990s.

These political influences provide the backdrop for the Columbine killings. While the adult leaders of some of these groups generally limit their hatemongering to words, young people are more likely to use fists, knives, guns, Doc Marten boots, and bombs.

**The solution is collective action.** The prescription for the political illness of fascism is education and community mobilisation against the Hitlerites and in support of all those targeted by them.

Justin Norman, a Black athlete at Colombine High, told *Emerge* magazine: “I saw swastikas and stuff that said ‘White Power.’ The janitors would come in later and clean them off.” School officials apparently ignored signs of fascist activity like these.

Instead of closing their eyes, administrators, teachers, students and parents need to recognise and talk frankly about the dangers posed by fascist organisers in their midst or on the internet. When youth come to school in swastika- emblasoned clothes, the response should be teach-ins and school assemblies on what Nazism means and why the whole student body has an interest in taking a stand against racism, sexism, homophobia, anti-Semitism, anti- communism, and ultra-nationalism.

And advocates of white supremacy in the wider society should be met by community protests and rallies.

United Front Against Fascism (UFAF), a Seattle-based coalition of unionists, feminists, people of color, Jews, gays and radicals, has successfully picketed numerous white supremacist events over the last 10 years. Most recently, UFAF organised protests exposing Ku Klux Klan recruiters in Auburn, Washington and the Nazi rock band Blood Axis, led by Michael Moynihan, which was scheduled to play at a Seattle club as part of a tour last year. The international publicity initiated by UFAF forced Blood Axis to cancel appearances in both the U.S. and Europe.

In order to prevent future massacres here or abroad, let us honour the dead at Littleton with a growing determination to combat the fascists who are trying to recruit our children.

## Understanding and combatting the rise of reaction in Brazil

## Debbie Brennan

\[*Freedom Socialist Organiser*)\[https://socialism.com/fso-article/understanding-and-combatting-the-rise-of-reaction-in-brazil/) \| January 2019

*On 23 January 2019, three weeks after the inauguration of Jair Bolsonaro as Brazil’s new President, the Freedom Socialist Party hosted a forum,* **Understanding and combatting the rise of reaction in Brazil.** *Speakers were Si Aguilar, indigenous Brazilian feminist and teacher, who grew up in a poor community of Belo Horizonte; Loan Cardoso, communist and supporter of the Brazilian Socialist and Freedom Party (PSOL), Bolivarian tendency; and Debbie Brennan, organiser against the far right and emerging fascists, longtime unionist and member of the Freedom Socialist Party. Below is Debbie Brennan’s talk.*

If Jair Bolsonaro’s election were made into a movie, the starring role would have to be the capitalists, the winners. We’d watch them throw aside the Workers Party’s (PT), which had served them for 13 years. We’d see a bewildered Left, helplessly standing by. In the shadows we’d see the hands of Wall Street. But the real stars are the Brazilian masses, who haven’t finished speaking and resisting.

In 2002, 53 million Brazilians voted Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva and the Workers Party into government. The hopeful euphoria, similar to Obama’s election six years later, echoed throughout the world. At the time, one percent of Brazilians lived luxuriously off 50% of the national income. Half of Brazilians lived in poverty, while international corporations siphoned millions in profits every year. Three percent owned almost two-thirds of Brazil’s arable lands, while about 25 million rural people had no property at all.

The PT rose out of the courageous strikes of 1979 in the industrial areas of São Paulo, which challenged the military dictatorship in power since 1964. The walkouts brought together unionists, leftists, students and community activists against the dictatorship, which eventually fell in 1985. This was the party the working class swept into office in 2002.

But eight months later, 25,000 demonstrated in the streets, denouncing Lula for attacking the pensions of public workers. He told starving Brazilians to wait for the foreign debt to be paid. He slashed the budget by nearly \$4 billion, as the IMF demanded. He taxed workers more and businesses less. Pensions were a battleground then, as it’s about to be under Bolsonaro.

Just after Lula’s victory, the Freedom Socialist Party (FSP) critiqued that “Lula had sold his soul to Wall Street to get elected.” To win, he promised international investors that he would continue to protect their interests. He also aligned with bourgeois parties in an electoral coalition. José Alencar, from the pro-free-trade Liberal Party, was his vice presidential running mate. Alencar was a textile millionaire, and his party was close to the Pentacostal Universal Church of the Kingdom of God — one of Bolsonaro’s main backers. One of the first things Lula did was send his Workers Party representative, José Dirceu, to reassure Wall Street that everything would be fine. Lula delivered, and he would become a favourite of the Obama presidency.

Lula’s government not only went after pensions, it administered the privatisation of Brazil’s second largest nationalised mining company. Its government provided military forces for the UN occupation of Haiti, where they stayed for 13 years. This was part of Lula’s lobbying for Brazil to have a permanent seat in the UN Security Council, which it got in 2011 — making Brazil a junior imperialist power.

Corruption was a major election issue last year, and Bolsonaro slung lots of mud at the PT — much of it involving Petrobras, Brazil’s state-owned oil company. Even before this Dirceu, who became Lula’s chief of staff, had been jailed for engineering a bribery scandal — called “the big monthly payment” — in which the PT paid for votes to get legislation through. A cabinet minister went to prison for collecting bribes for Dilma Rousseff’s election campaign. Corruption is endemic in the capitalist state, and the PT was an energetic player.

Dilma Rousseff was Lula’s handpicked successor as Brazil’s president from 2011 until her impeachment in 2018. Her electoral win in 2014 was through a similar coalition deal with bourgeois parties.

By 2013, the economy was in a steep downturn. Brazil’s inflation rate was above 9%, unemployment above 11% and the foreign debt was growing. Mass protest erupted over an increase in bus fares, but people were angry about much more — corruption, police brutality, poor services as the government spent big on the World Cup, and so on. These demonstrations were the biggest Brazil had seen in more than two decades.

Protest broke out again three years later, in March 2016. At 3½ million, the national demonstrations are said to be the largest in Brazil’s history. The protesters were overwhelmingly middle class, but workers and the poor were also voicing anger at the PT’s inability to handle the crisis.

It’s these demos and the PT’s paralysis that made the capitalist class abandon the party that had been giving it blood transfusions since 2003. Brazil’s business groups colluded with media owners, neoliberal political parties, evangelical churches, the powerful judiciary and Wall Street to remove Rousseff. The capitalists carefully engineered her ousting, all within the law of the constitution. It was actually a political coup. The colluders couldn’t have done it, though, without years of PT corruption and the party letting down its mass base — workers, slum dwellers and rural poor.

With workers here walking away from the Australian Labor Party, it’s not hard to see how the PT delivered itself to this humiliating defeat, just as the U.S. Democrats did in 2016. In a highly polarised United States, Trump rode a wave of working people’s lost hope and rage at the Establishment; Bolsonaro did the same. Votes for him were votes against the PT, which had become identified with the Establishment and the bourgeoisie it had supported for 13 years.

The lesson is: a workers’ party cannot successfully administer a capitalist state. And if it tries, it loses its principles, its soul and its base.

Betrayed by the PT and faced with organised rightwing reaction, where could workers and the oppressed look for leadership? Where was the revolutionary Left? It was fragmented, weak, unprepared and paralyzed. The entire Brazilian Left — with the exception of the Trotskyist Revolutionary Socialist Movement — played an opportunistic role by calling for a vote for the PT as the “lesser evil.” Brazil’s Socialism and Freedom Party (PSOL) honestly critiqued its own part in the “Vote PT” call, saying it was a fundamental and disastrous mistake. By doing this, says PSOL, they and the others failed to distinguish themselves from the PT, offering working class voters no electoral alternative. They went silent on the big issue of corruption so not to weaken Lula and the PT. By not questioning the framework of the public debt, they gave legitimacy to the capitalist economic agenda. They even hid PSOL’s logos from their campaign materials, and they didn’t mention the word “socialism”! PSOL acknowledges that they offered the electorate no positive choice and lost the respect of voters, who expected more.

It’s important to know that about 22% of the electorate did not vote. Of the 78% that voted, Bolsonaro got 55% and the PT’s Haddad got 44%. That 44% came from the northeast, Brazil’s poorest region. In all, 43% of Brazil’s electorate voted for Bolsonaro, and a clear majority (57%) did not. If the PT weren’t so treacherous or if the Left showed leadership, we would have seen a different result.

Stephen Durham, FSP’s international coordinator, who lived in Brazil and remains close to developments there, says this: “Bolsonaro’s election is one more indication of the worldwide polarisation and the weakness of the Left to provide a credible alternative in elections.” What we witnessed in Brazil is a ***global crisis in late capitalism*** — a crisis of social democracy and a challenge for the revolutionary Left.

Bolsonaro’s presidency is three weeks old, so now we have more than his rhetoric to go by. On his first day, he targeted indigenous and LGBTIQ people and descendants of Brazil’s former slaves. One of his presidential orders was to wind back the rights of indigenous people and slave descendants to control and inhabit their lands. Another transferred the responsibility of delineating indigenous territories to the Agriculture Ministry, whose head opposes tribal land rights and champions agribusiness. And another transferred oversight of indigenous health, housing, language preservation and other affairs from the National Indian Foundation to a new ministry for family, women and human rights — headed, no less, by a far-right evangelical pastor. Bolsonaro pointedly kept LGBTIQ issues out of this ministry, which leaves them with no coverage by any agency.

On inauguration day, Brazil’s financial market was full of optimism. Stocks for the arms maker Taurus, a main ally of Bolsonaro, for example, shot up more than 47%. But according to The Financial Times in the U.S., big capital is watching to see whether Bolsonaro can live up to his electoral bravado about making the economy great. Brazil is dogged with foreign and public debt, and capital needs Bolsonaro to remove the restrictions of regulation and taxes. Will he be able to cut retirement pensions, which take up 1/3 of the budget, for example? How far can he go with his promises to privatise, fix the tax regime and lower the tariffs? How will he pull off forging close relations with the U.S. and Israel without affecting Brazil’s important trade with China and the Middle East?

There are divisions in Bolsonaro’s government. There’s a fight, for example, over control of foreign policy, and we can already see this being played out over Brazil’s orientation toward the U.S. versus China. Bolsonaro wants a close relationship with the U.S. and, following Trump, he has openly criticized China and even provocatively visited Taiwan while still a candidate. But his deputy president, General Hamilton Mourão, doesn’t want to risk the China partnership or angering Brazilian businesses that depend on it. He openly contradicted his boss — such as his statement to the media, “Sometimes the president has a rhetoric that does not go along with reality.”

It’ll also be interesting to see how far Bolsonaro will work with the White House in undermining the governments of Cuba, Venezuela and Nicaragua.

Already, Bolsonaro is fumbling on key commitments. He’s backed off on his plans to stop a land reform program, which includes land transfers to the poor. His order to cease awarding new lands to indigenous groups has stalled. He is wavering on his announced changes to pensions. His administration isn’t moving on its promise to move Brazil’s embassy in Israel to Jerusalem. ***The pressure from the masses is showing its strength.***

*The Financial Times* sums it up this way: “…with expectations sky high, Bolsonaro will need to deliver — or his administration’s honeymoon with both voters and markets will be short-lived.”

How many here, especially Brazilians among us, think that Bolsonaro won’t be confronted with massive resistance? Last year, the Freedom Socialist Party and our sister organisation, Radical Women, marched with Brazilians here as part of global protest — first against the assassination of Marielle Franco, and then against Bolsonaro. September’s Ele Não (Not Him) marches across the world were mobilised by women and young people, who represent all who Bolsonaro wants subjugated or eliminated. The World Cup protests in 2013 exploded over everything from fare hikes to education, health, inequality and poverty. Protests like these and the anti-dictatorship walkouts of 1979 show that resistance is part of Brazilians’ history and living memory. I can imagine the resistance still to come.

This brings us to the question: Is Bolsonaro a fascist? His brutish homophobia, sexism and racism, his open love for military dictatorship, his threats against the Left, and the backing he enjoys from big capital have led many, including some of the international Marxist Left, to call him a fascist. But we can’t be loose with the term. To know how to respond, we need to know what we’re dealing with. If we mistake a situation as fascist, then we’ll miss signs of the real threat and be unprepared for it.

Odious, dangerous far-right ideas are not what make someone fascist. Fascist demagoguery uses any rhetoric — even socialist — to hook in a following. “Nazi” stood for Hitler’s National-Socialist Workers Party!

Words don’t make fascism, ***deeds*** do. Fascism is an authoritarian form of government that capitalism will resort to in order to save itself from people’s revolt. This happens when workers’ revolution is possible, and parliamentary democracy can no longer maintain capitalist order. The capitalist class is then prepared to centralise all power in one person or an élite. Fascism’s prime purpose is to ***exterminate*** working class unions and organizations, and thus workers’ capacity to organise.

To do this, fascists seek to build a mass movement, primarily in the middle class — small business or self-employed people who are neither workers nor big capitalists — to have a social base that gives it a mandate to rule. It puts the idea of nation above the individual, as well as using race and sex to divide society between the “worthy” and “unworthy.” The experience of fascism last century shows us what it does with those its deems unworthy.

This doesn’t describe Brazil now. The working class is not defeated, and the far-right forces are not consolidated. But class struggle will most likely escalate as Bolsonaro’s privatisation and other measures kick in, and we should expect to see the main targets — women, young people, poor, LGBTIQ, Black and indigenous people — fighting back most militantly.

As global capitalism’s crisis escalates, fascism becomes a threat for Brazil, the U.S., Australia and countries throughout the world. This is why we take organized fascist gangs in the here-and-now very seriously. These street thugs are emboldened and enabled by the likes of Bolsonaro, Trump and our own Peter Dutton, and we have to defeat them. We also have to fight assaults by these parliamentary goons on our unions and jobs, education and health, human and civil rights, environment and climate. We have to solidarize with each other across our countries’ borders. If we don’t, we could face fascism when capitalism decides it’s necessary.

This task is global. For the exploited and oppressed to survive, we need to ***look to ourselves***, not parliamentary elections, for redress and solutions. In doing this, we need to form united fronts and defend ourselves.

This fight is revolutionary, because the only solution is to uproot the source of this crisis. We have to destroy capitalism and create an alternative system where profit can no longer exist and exploitation and oppression are no longer possible. Socialism would be a global economic system that meets the needs of everyone, because workers would collectively run it.

Through the Committee for Revolutionary International Regroupment, the Freedom Socialist Party has been working since 2013 with Latin American Trotskyist organisations toward founding a new socialist international. For revolutionaries from opposite ends of imperialism — the U.S. and Latin America — to come together to achieve this is powerful. This revolutionary solidarity, well expressed by the slogan “same struggle, same fight,” took the FSP and RW to the Brazilian community’s protests in Melbourne last year. Tonight’s forum comes from this solidarity.

Capitalism’s desperate fight to stay in power is drawing our global struggles closer. Through international, revolutionary collaboration and organisation, the working class and oppressed of this world will get the upper hand — and then be able to seize the power.

## Dateline Australia: Rise is fascist terror cries out for urgent action

### Christchurch, New Zealand

The shooting massacre of Muslims in Christchurch, New Zealand (NZ) set off a global shock wave. The March 15 attack on two mosques killed 51 worshippers, the youngest three years old, and critically injured 50. The shooter is a 28-year-old white Australian from Grafton, New South Wales and living in Dunedin, NZ. He is a self-proclaimed “ethno nationalist eco fascist” intent on saving the “European” population from “genocide.”

While most were horrified by the tragic deaths, the killer’s actions inspired another. On April 27, six weeks later, a 19-year-old white nationalist entered a synagogue in Poway, California with an assault weapon. Shouting anti-Semitic slurs like “Jews are ruining the world,” he opened fire. In an online statement posted before the attack, he claimed inspiration from the Christchurch killing. The anti-Semitic and anti-immigrant rhetoric from his “manifesto” is that spewed by white supremacists around the world.

**Rising right hypes xenophobia.** A number of far-right and openly neo-Nazi groups have been operating in Christchurch. And they didn’t appear suddenly from nowhere. For 250 years, racism has been the weapon for British, then U.S., control in the South Pacific. From early colonialism to global imperialist rule, capitalist powers have used white supremacy to justify their invasions, land theft and plunder. New Zealand and Australia are part of this history, and they are both complicit. The 1 percent of these white settler states exploited the lands, resources and cheap labour of the First Nations to become prosperous players in the global economy.

Like the rest of the capitalist world, money and race have always been the basis of immigration to New Zealand — also known by its Maori name, Aotearoa — and Australia. Government-fueled xenophobia against people from Asia, the Middle East and Africa remains rife. The War on Terror — unleashed by U.S. President George W. Bush after Sept. 11, 2001 — made Muslims the global bogeyman. Islamophobia has infected the non-Muslim capitalist world, and it’s been a breeding ground for extreme-right and fascist groups.

For the past five years, neo-Nazis and the far right have been organising worldwide, helped by the dog whistling — “Muslim terrorists,” “African gangs” and so on — of politicians, police and media. Since the resurgence of open fascist mobilising in Australia in 2015, the Freedom Socialist Party, Radical Women and many other groups have counter-mobilised every time they’ve shown their faces. Anti-fascists have persistently warned about the all-clear signal these enablers give to bigots and hate groups. For years, Muslim women in NZ/Aotearoa warned the authorities of the potential for attack from the far right.

Successive Australian governments, both Labor and Coalition, also created the climate of racist, xenophobic paranoia that nurtures far-right terror. The brutal “stop the boats” regime sentencing refugees to life in offshore hellholes; the racial profiling, especially of First Nations and immigrants of African and Middle Eastern background; the lie of rising crime perpetrated by non-white gangs; the falsehood that migrants take jobs, university places, welfare benefits and health entitlements from those Australian-born — all this was ammo for the shooter.

Since the Christchurch attack, the dog-whistlers have ramped up their message that the Left is as extreme and violent as the Right. In Australia, parliamentary apologists across the spectrum continue to mislead. The usual types, such as Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton, have been joined by the Australian Labor Party Opposition Leader, Bill Shorten, in vowing to stamp out “extremism” and “hate” from both directions. This is a green light for the state and fascists to go after the Left.

**The time is now!** On March 16, untold hundreds of thousands marched across Europe and the United Kingdom, in New York City, Washington, D.C. and Melbourne in a coordinated global action against racism and fascism. These rallies expressed solidarity with the Muslim community of Christchurch and everywhere. This kind of independent and united working-class action is what Parliament’s fascist-enablers want to stamp out.

The global situation is escalating, and a sense of urgency is growing. The steady outcry against the emerging fascist threat, and the massive protests on March 16, give us heart. We need to harness this into a united front, through which diverse organisations join in common action to stop the fascists. A united front must be broad and democratic — respecting our programmatic differences and uniting around agreed principles for disciplined action. And it must be led by the working class.

Our survival depends on this. If we don’t stop the fascists now, then this dangerous movement will grow. Its barbarity, shown 80 years ago, is a lesson to heed. Capitalism will use a fascist movement as its shock troops against the working class when it fears revolt. The principal targets will be unions and the Left in order to crush the working class and our capacity to organise. Unions are critical to the united front: this is where workers — those targeted by fascists — are organised.

We can stop the right. The 120,000-strong union marches in Melbourne last year, and again in March, demonstrated what a united front could achieve. A larger, more massive united front would make the fascists turn tail. It would embolden the working class to bring capitalism to its knees. To stop fascism permanently requires socialism, a system created and run by the working class. Without capitalism, there can be no fascism.

## From Bangkok to Jakarta to Kuala Lumpur: We’re here, we’re queer and we’re organising!

Homophobia and transphobia are on the rise across South East Asia. So is LGBTIQ activist organising, determined to turn the tide and advance queer visibility and rights across the region.

Last year, two lesbians were caned in Malaysia and a male couple experienced the same fate in Aceh. Also in Aceh, a dozen transgender women were arrested at a beauty parlour, where they worked. Before being released, they were forced to dress as men and have their heads shaved. A same-sex couple was arrested in Bandung for running a gay community Facebook page. Police raided Kuala Lumpur’s oldest gay club — the first time in 30 years — justifying this as necessary to “mitigate the LGBT culture from spreading into our society.”

Those in the Malaysian LGBTIQ community who had hoped the change of government last year — after six decades — might bring improvements have been disappointed. One government minister ordered that photos of LGBTIQ activists be removed from an art exhibition celebrating reform. The Minister for Tourism, when asked at a travel fair in Germany if the country was safe for queer visitors, claimed there are no gays in Malaysia!

In the small Sultanate of Brunei, laws came into effect in April that punish gay male sex with death by stoning. Women found guilty of lesbian sex can be given 40 cane strokes and jailed for 10 years.

As the global economic crisis worsens, dictatorial and rightwing populist leaders are gaining a foothold, and the far right is finding fertile ground to put down roots. Religious sectarianism, reactionary nationalism, racism and anti-immigrant hysteria, climate change denial, and the demonising of feminism and sexual and gender diversity are tactics that are becoming familiar. In South East Asia, strong anti-imperialist sentiment is manipulated to brand LGBTIQ organising as Western inspired and antithetical to tradition.

**Long traditions of diversity.** Indonesia’s post-Suharto era has seen a rise of rightwing Islamist vigilante groups across the archipelago, and the general climate has worsened since 2016 for queer sex and gender diverse Indonesians. Despite this, the country does not have anti-gay laws or a tradition of targeting LGBTIQ people. Gender diversity has long been a part of traditional Javanese culture, with male to female transgender folk, known as Waria, well accepted and integrated into the community.

Malaysia has similar pre-colonial traditions, and gender diversity is a part of the culture. This is reflected in greater acceptance of transgender family members in the ethnically Malay community, where challenging the gender binary is frequently affirmed. It’s through sodomy laws imposed by colonial powers that homosexuality was criminalised.

To present the rising homophobia and transphobia in South East Asia through the prism of queer LGBTIQ activism as a Western import is equally simplistic and dangerous. Explaining it as the direct byproduct of Muslim religion fuels the generalised Islamophobia of the far right in countries like Australia. Followers of Islam are as politically divided as believers of any other religion. Muslims, too, are across the ideological spectrum — from socialists and feminists to open reactionaries and fascists. And amongst the Muslim community, including believers, are advocates for LGBTIQ rights. Australia’s first gay Imam, Nur Warsame, urges queer Muslims to have no shame about their sexuality. In Yogyakarta, there is a mosque that serves the transgender community.

**When the going gets tough!** Far from being intimidated by the rise of bigotry, there’s exciting organising happening throughout the region. LGBTIQ groups took to the streets of Kuala Lumpur in March to join an International Women’s Day protest. And when government ministers accused organisers of “misusing democratic space,” the international solidarity was instant, including an action called by Malaysian Progressives outside the Consulate in Melbourne.

Timor-Leste held it first Pride Parade in 2017. Last year there was a Pride Festival in Myanmar, and in January this year 600 participated in the country’s first Pride boat parade. The Phuket Pride parade is coming up for its 20th anniversary, and the Thai government is considering introducing same-sex civil partnerships. In Singapore, the challenging environment, which includes a ban on foreigners participating, has not stopped the annual Pink Dot pride rally that first took place in 2009.

Last year, queer activists from across the Association of Southeast Asian Nations ran a cross-border Hugs Not Hate campaign to mark International Day Against Homophobia, Transphobia and Biphobia. The Jakarta-based activist organisation, Arus Pelangi, which means “Rainbow Flow,” was formed in 2006. It organises the lesbian, gay, bi, transgender and intersex communities and has adopted important principles, including the rejection of any government funding so it can “remain independent and unfettered to criticise discriminatory policies towards LGBT that are currently employed by the government.”

The Freedom Socialist Party has backed fundraising efforts for Arus Pelangi and advocates international solidarity with LGBTIQ organising in the region.

**When homophobia becomes murderous.** With homosexuality now a capital offence, the repression in Brunei is so extreme and the situation so dire that there is really no space for LGBTIQ people to organise. Sex and gender diverse people in Brunei seeking to flee must be given asylum in safe countries, including Australia. Zain, a trans woman, left Brunei last year and is now seeking asylum in Canada. All like Zain who wish to leave must be supported to do so.

A global campaign is putting pressure on the wealthy Sultan of Brunei. The University of Aberdeen revoked an honorary degree it had awarded to the absolute monarch. A key focus of the campaign is the nine luxury hotels he owns, one in Brisbane. A lively rally outside the Royal on the Park attracted widespread media coverage. Rally speakers emphasised their solidarity with the queer Muslim citizens of Brunei, who bear the brunt of the barbaric laws.

The other campaign target is Royal Brunei Airlines. In response to community demands, STA Travel has stopped selling tickets. The Queensland government has suspended plans for the airline to fly into that state, and London Transport has removed all advertising for the airline. Importantly, unions, including the Transport Workers Union, are discussing how to support the LGBTIQ community of the Sultanate.

When the bigots and hatemongers in other parts of the region started commenting favourably on the Brunei measures, the LGBTI community stepped in. Activists protested outside the Brunei Embassy in Bangkok and presented a statement signed by 130 organisations from Thailand, Singapore, The Philippines, Malaysia and Indonesia.

Sex and gender diverse people have a long history of living and loving right across South East Asia. Politics in this region is becoming just as polarised as in other parts of the world. The battle lines are drawn and local LGBTIQ leaders are firing up. Stand with them!

## German far right surges with anti-migrant racism

## Luma Nichol

[*Freedom Socialist*](https://socialism.com/fs-article/german-far-right-surges-with-anti-migrant-racism/) \| April 2025

In the recent parliamentary election, the ultra-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) came in second to the establishment conservatives. As the country’s economy falters, AfD grows by scapegoating Muslim immigrants. However, opposition to their racism is fierce.

Ring the alarm bells! In a seismic political shift, the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) seized second place in national elections held Feb. 23. The racist, anti-immigrant party won 20.8% of the vote for Germany’s Bundestag (parliament), surging past the Social Democratic Party (SPD) and Greens. Only the conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU/CSU) bested AfD with 28.5% of the vote.

AfD’s ascendance in Hitler’s homeland gives renewed urgency to the building of united fronts to counter the reactionary forces sweeping Europe.

## Turning bigotry into votes

East Germany swung especially rightward. There, wages are lower, and xenophobes are scapegoating Muslims and immigrants for the region’s economic woes. AfD capitalized on the bigotry of Pegida (Patriotic Europeans Against the Islamization of the West), which organized Islamophobic rallies in 2015-2016. AfD calls for border closures and mass deportations, especially of Muslims.

AfD opposes LGBTQ+ and women’s rights, denies climate change, and demonizes the Left. In painting the Palestine solidarity movement as anti-Semitic, the party downplays its embrace of prominent members who defend elements of Nazism. In 2024, the party was expelled from a right-wing association in the European Union (EU) when their representative whitewashed the Nazi SS.

Before the election, Team Trump also gave AfD a boost, with billionaire Elon Musk proclaiming, “Only the AfD can save Germany.” In response to this, European sales of Tesla tumbled.

## Deutschland in decline

Germany is the European Union’s economic powerhouse, prime supplier of weapons to Ukraine, and NATO mainstay. But with the economy’s downward turn in recent years, workers are bearing the brunt. Grocery bills and rents are spiking as wages and social services shrivel. Energy costs skyrocketed after the government cut off Russian oil due to the war in Ukraine.

Exports are declining, businesses are struggling, and thousands of workers fear layoffs. The car industry, a manufacturing heavyweight, is faltering under competition from China. Strikes are at their highest level in 25 years. Powerful unions are organizing protests as companies downsize and violate worker agreements.

The country is riven by social discord as well. AfD is successfully exploiting the climate of economic uncertainty by scapegoating refugees from war-torn Afghanistan and Syria. The far right is promoting anti-immigrant sentiment to deflect attention away from the economic policies that have benefited global corporatization.

Today’s hard times came under the coalition of Social Democratic Party and Greens, all of whom have governed since 2021. Workers are justifiably angry at these so-called “center-left” parties. The February election signaled a total rejection of their capitalist austerity strategies: the SPD met its biggest defeat since the end of World War II. For those not ready to abandon establishment parties, the top choice was the conservative CDU/CSU, with Friedrich Merz as Germany’s new Chancellor.

The elections reflected a pattern sweeping Europe. From Austria and Italy to France and Sweden, voters are rejecting the status quo. Some are turning Left. Die Linke (the Left) unexpectedly netted 9% of Germany’s vote with the backing of women and youth. Their program is anti-war, pro-environment, and committed to social justice, especially feminism and LGBTQ+ rights. It is the only party that is not calling for limits to immigration. But Die Linke also believes the for-profit economic system can be reformed.

## Build a united front

Unfortunately, many voters are turning rightward. And without a clear anti-capitalist electoral challenge, grassroots organizing is more urgent than ever. Promises to keep a “firewall” against the right wing in the Bundestag haven’t stopped the AfD. And now, as the party ascends to second place, leaders will fully utilize their new electoral platform. The victorious CDU/CSU, while pledging not to work with extremists, are almost as rabid. Earlier this year, they collaborated with AfD on anti-immigration legislation, sparking huge protests. They have also called for investigating anti-fascist organizers.

Clearly, CDU/CSU won’t stop the rise of Nazism. Nor will status quo institutions or laws. Understanding the dynamics of fascism is important. It is Big Business’s last-resort solution to falling profit margins. And the antidote is working-class fightback and solidarity among society’s most oppressed layers.

For the past two years, massive protests against the far right have rocked Germany. In 2024, over a million people hit the streets in the largest protest movement since WWII. In February 2025, angry demonstrators marched on Berlin, Hamburg, Munich, Cologne and Leipzig, incensed by AfD-CDU collaboration.

The protests were organized by more than a thousand organizations, including unions, churches, synagogues, soccer clubs and groups like Grannies Against the Right, and Fridays for Future, the environmental youth group. This, plus labor’s upsurge, has the potential to become a united front against fascism, one capable of taking the offense and putting the demands of Germany’s multi-ethnic, multi-gendered and multi-aged working class in the fore. Such a united front could push back the neo-Nazi upsurge, not just in Germany but throughout Europe.

## Defeat the fascist threat with a united front of labor and the oppressed

### As the far right grows, the united front strategy is an essential defense.

## Luma Nichol

[*Freedom Socialist*](https://socialism.com/fs-article/defeat-the-fascist-threat-with-a-united-front-of-labor-and-the-oppressed/) \| February 2025

The current spread of fascist ideas is alarming. On the street, in social media, and on the airwaves, it is common to hear bigotry, even a call for violence, against immigrants, trans folk, defenders of reproductive rights, communists, people of color, unionists, and other vulnerable groups. This attitude once flourished only in dark corners inhabited by white supremacists. Now it is blared from the U.S. Capitol.

Stopping the Hitlerites requires bold, loud, mass opposition — a united front. This hampers right-wing organizing and demoralizes would-be followers. A model for standing up to fascist creeps is the United Front Against Fascism (UFAF), which was active in the 1990s in the Pacific Northwest, and which I co-led as a representative of the Freedom Socialist Party. UFAF built numerous large direct-action rallies to counter white-power gatherings and participated in many others up and down the West Coast. A decade of organized opposition scuttled the Aryan dream of establishing a homeland in the Northwest, but they have returned with the same goal of saving the tottering capitalist system.

## Unity in practice

A united front counters fascist efforts to rally a reactionary mass movement. This far-right outbreak seeks to destroy labor rights and civil liberties to give free rein to captains of industry in times of economic crisis.

Surmounting their divide-and-conquer tactics is essential. A united front facilitates different groupings working together around a shared goal. Russian revolutionary Leon Trotsky, a leader in the international fight against fascism in the 1930s and ’40s, expressed the strategy as “march separately, but strike together.”

UFAF embodied this concept. Because we respected differences and promoted collaboration, the group was composed of, and worked with, a wide range of communities. This included individuals and groups who were trans, homeless, Roma, Jewish, Black, youth, immigrant, queer, labor, socialist, anarchist, Korean American, Latino, and Native American. The queer community was an especially strong force. No one was expected to downplay their issues as long as they collaborated on the shared program of militant action.

We also helped other groups put the united front concept into practice. In 1993, anti-fascists in Vancouver, British Columbia, were planning a protest of a White Aryan Resistance speaker. Shockingly, some demonstration planners objected to LGBTQ+ participation. UFAF worked with local organizers to reach a solution that did not tear the movement apart: Contingents would march from several locations and meet at a central rally. UFAF and the Vancouver Freedom Socialist Party blanketed the large crowd with pro-LGBTQ+ rights literature while celebrating a new level of solidarity.

## Worker-focused

A united front must be of and for the working class or it risks being co-opted by the profit system it is confronting. As the organized expression of the working class, unions are the ultimate target for fascist obliteration. So, the intersectional interests of workers of all colors and genders must drive the united front. Plus, workers understand discipline, solidarity and self-defense, and unions have resources to aid the fight.

When UFAF began, only rank-and-file individuals, notably Black workers, joined our protests. That changed over the years. The Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees local donated the use of their roving strike kitchen to feed cold and hungry protesters at one winter protest. In 1999, UFAF assisted the King County Labor Council in organizing a demonstration against Nazi skinheads in Enumclaw, Washington.

UFAF operated democratically and valued leadership, including that of the founding Freedom Socialist Party. The group’s demands and operating methods were upfront, with written Principles of Unity (see “[United Front Against Fascism Principles of Unity](https://socialism.com/fs-article/united-front-against-fascism-principles-of-unity/). Those who did not agree with the decisions of the united front were free to do their own thing but were asked not to compete with the group’s efforts. UFAF worked with people across the political spectrum and welcomed the participation of elected officials, but never as policymakers since this would dilute its working-class orientation.

This form of organization differs from the horizontalism of Occupy Wall Street, for example, which disdained leadership. But structurelessness and the consensus process are liabilities when up against a potentially violent enemy, where quick decision-making by designated leaders is essential.

## Hit the right with a strong left

Trump’s rants about the “enemy within” are aimed directly at radicals. Reminiscent of the 1950s anti-communist witch-hunts, his supporters in the Capital Research Center have compiled a list of 150 targets for government persecution. They say U.S. leaders of pro-Palestinian “terrorism” are “revolutionaries who advocate radical forms of socialism, communism/Marxism, anarchism, and Islamist extremism.”

Clearly, left groups need to come together in a united front instead of elevating disagreements to the point of total lack of cooperation, as happens too often. Socialists and communists are vital to a united front — we provide leadership to the many who want to fight back but lack experience and historical insight.

The stakes are high, but we can and must build a united front to prevent fascism! The lives of millions depend on it.
