<p>"As Prashad reminds us, the South held around 1% of internationally recognised patents at the time[47]. Criticism of “the present world intellectual property system – of patents, trademarks and copyrights”[48] because it gave the North an unfair, even monopolistic, advantage in the South were rejected by neoliberals who suggested that “massive research and development expenditures by Northern private sectors” would only continue if there remained a reasonable expectation of returns on these investments[49]. Insightfully, in its second meeting, however, the Commission noted the hypocrisy of global arrangements maintaining free movement of technology and labour from the North whilst allowing national laws to control immigration from the South"</p>
