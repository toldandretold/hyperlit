# Tripping Out: Marxist Autobiography of a Petty-Bourgeois Stoner #

How is historical materialism created? A historian sits down with primary sources and interprets them. Sources are tied together, in the historian's imagination, using various theories of causation. Through this process, a plurality of plausible theories are created. Each theory alludes to further evidence, the evidence needed to further prove or disprove the theory. Sometimes, the evidence needed is historical. Could primary sources in a particular archive provide evidence into the decision making of a key historical turning point, or of the available options? Other times, the required evidence can be found in the future. For example, when a historical theory supports a particular strategic position, it can be tested by enacting that theory when the historical conditions it has successfully predicted arise. 

Already, it has become obvious that the relatively simple method of interpreting primary sources quickly leads to a pluralistic, theoretical nightmare, which itself gives rise to a further, deeper, engagement with historical research and political action. In this sense, historical materialism truly is living. Like the circuits of capital that it has theorised, historical materialist knowledge is not a thing, a fixed finalised object, but an ongoing process of accumulation. In fact, the starting point that I have given is itself a gross simplification. The historian does not start interpreting sources as a blank slate. Even if the process started with a totally random selection of available historical sources, it is impossible to ask questions of those sources without some prior theorisation. This initial consciousness is itself a part of the broader historical development, and ones particular spatial and temporal relation to it. It is for this reason that historical materialism is created by revolutionaries. Those who seek to change the world draw upon a theory of historical change. It is for the same reason that defenders of the status quo rely on ahistorical theories, theories which assume that the existing order is natural, theories which marvel at its apparent stability while offering guidance on how it should be preserved. 

Historical materialism must –– if it is to be honest with itself –– also look inwards. It is good practice for the historical materialist to consider their own position in space time, and how this has shaped their historical materialism. This means, in short: a historical materialist autobiography, a history of the self in its historical totality. Of course, such biographies don't need to be published. They are more relevant, arguably, as footnotes. Even then, they are rarely going to be anything but arduous. Publishers won't touch them. They won't even respond with an automated email. Where, then, should these introspections go? Should they simply vanish into the air, taken by entropy like the clouds of the bongs that spawned them? Probably. But they could also live on as digital footnotes. There, they don't take up anyone's printing space, and they only need be read by consciousness that is as equally twisted, and hyper-meta. As a deep-note on hyperlit.io, historical materialist autobiographies can just be, there for anyone who ever –– god help them –– felt the need. 

In this case, this is an autobiography of a petty-bourgeois stoner, the child of a farmer who, according to Antonio Gramsci, was perfect fodder for fascism:
