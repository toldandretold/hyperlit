## Professional Summary

A historian and amateur coder passionate about increasing access to knowledge. After relocating from a small family farm, I struggled to adapt to university life. Fortunately, this process was formative and I eventually discovered a rich intellectual life. Through PhD research, in-class teaching, and work at the Tertiary Education Quality Standards Agency (TEQSA), I gained unique experience of the higher education system. In recent years, I wrote sci-fi scripts for a video game, published an academic article, and began developing a website focused on promoting global access to academic knowledge.
