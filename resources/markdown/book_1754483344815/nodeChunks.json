The NIEO's draft declarations were brought to the\nUN General Assembly by the leaders of 95 states, caucused as the G77.\nTheir solidarity was necessarily pluralistic, drawing on Marxist and\nLiberal visions of what Adom Getachew called “post-imperial\nworldmaking”. This raises the question of how this global \"common front\"\nwas possible, and what the PI might do differently this time. As a\npartial explanation, I compare two of the project's strategic\nimaginaries, showing that they were successfully synthesised in\npractice. As this legacy inspires the PI's focus on the possibilities of\nsovereign debt crises, the NIEO continues to play an important\nhistorical role.

Right now, the Progressive\nInternational (PI) is seeking to \"Renew the Non-Aligned Movement\" and\n\"Renovate the NIEO\" (<a class=\"in-text-citation\" href=\"#havana2023\">Havana Congress 2023</a>). The original project\nattempted to resolve an uncertain world economic crisis by reaching a\nglobal consensus on the reformation of the post-WWII world order, or the\nrules and institutions of global trade, finance and debt. For example,\nthe <em>Declaration on the Establishment of a NIEO</em> explained that:\n\"Since 1970, the world economy has experienced a series of grave crises\nwhich have had severe repercussions, especially on the developing\ncountries because of their generally greater vulnerability to external\neconomic impulses.\" It also stated that it had been \"impossible to\nachieve an even and balanced development of the international community\nunder the existing international economic order\" (<a class=\"in-text-citation\" href=\"#un1974a\">UN 1974a</a>). The passing\nof the NIEO's founding declarations led to a wholesale reconsideration,\nacross the entire United Nations system, of the global architecture of\ndevelopment.

        "content": "<p>Launched in May 2020, the PI is a movement of movements aiming to\nunite progressive forces globally, and its NIEO campaign is based on a\nsober assessment of the original. In calling to seize \"the opportunity\nof the present historical juncture\", its <em>Havana Declaration On The\nNIEO</em> notes that \"the crisis of the existing world system can either\nentrench inequalities or embolden the call to reclaim Southern\nprotagonism\" (<a class=\"in-text-citation\" href=\"#havana2023\">Havana Congress 2023</a>). This is a lesson from the rise and\ndecline of the solidarity of the original NIEO campaign. Initially, when\nthe Non-Aligned Movement leveraged the new power of the Organization of\nthe Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), \"Southern protagonism\" was\nemboldened. However, this was eventually crushed during the so-called\nThird World Debt Crisis. This presents the Progressive International\nwith the problem of understanding, as Yanis Varoufakis (<a class=\"in-text-citation\" href=\"#varoufakis2023\">2023</a>) has asked:\n\"Why did we lose last time round?\" Unfortunately, the academic\nliterature is still struggling to answer this question. Despite the\nhistorical reconsideration of the NIEO that followed Vijay Prashad's\npioneering histories of \"the Third World Project\" (<a class=\"in-text-citation\" href=\"#gilman2015\">Gilman 2015, 2023</a>; <a class=\"in-text-citation\" href=\"#prashad2007\">Prashad 2007, 2014</a>; <a class=\"in-text-citation\" href=\"#schwartz2023\">Schwartz 2023</a>), fundamental questions remain about\nthe NIEO's strategic decision making (<a class=\"in-text-citation\" href=\"#thornton2022\">Thornton 2022</a>; Venzka 2018). This\narticle provides a partial, and broad-brush answer. By relying on the\nmethod of C.L.R. James, I trace the counterfactuals –– or imaginary\n\"what if?\" scenarios –– that animated two of the NIEO's dominant\nstrategic imaginaries. That is, the imaginary futures which were used to\ndevise and decide between the available options, or strategic choices. I\nthen show how these strategic imaginaries were synthesised, first\ntheoretically and then in practice. This is important, I argue, because\nthe same strategic imaginaries continue to inspire the efforts of the\nProgressive International to revive the project. This proves, as Nils\nGilman (<a class=\"in-text-citation\" href=\"#gilman2023\">2023</a>) has argued, that the NIEO is a \"usable past\". It offers\nbadly needed alternatives to world order and global development.</p>",

Instead, G77 solidarity crumbled\namidst the so-called Third World Debt Crisis (<a class=\"in-text-citation\" href=\"#prashad2007\">Prashad 2007, 210</a>). In\nthis climate, a strange consensus emerged amongst those who had once\nviewed it as either a serious threat or opportunity. From the\nimperialist Henry Kissinger (<a class=\"in-text-citation\" href=\"#kissinger1982\">1982</a>), to the theorist of embedded\nliberalism, John Ruggie (<a class=\"in-text-citation\" href=\"#bhagwati1984\">Bhagwati and Ruggie 1984</a>) and the historical\nmaterialist Robert W. Cox (<a class=\"in-text-citation\" href=\"#cox1981\">1981</a>), all agreed. The demise of the NIEO\nproved that it had never stood a chance. This dismissive consensus\nbecame the baseline assumption across the social sciences, including in\ndevelopment studies. The pioneering Global Political Economist, Susan\nStrange, went so far as to describe the NIEO's hopes as \"an illusion\"\n(<a class=\"in-text-citation\" href=\"#strange2015\">Strange [1988] 2015, 263</a>). In Gilbert Rist's critique of development,\nhe argued that the NIEO's ambivalent proposals do \"no more than\nreinforce the existing order of things\" (1999, 49-150). There is nothing\nwrong with these conclusions, per se.2 The problem is that they were made\nwithout historical research into the decision making which had created\nand led the NIEO. To prove that the NIEO was powerless, one must\nunderstand the available options. Had G77 elites considered choices\nwhich, if taken, might have led to more success? In short, no one knew,\nand until Vijay Prashad's pioneering histories of the \"Third World\nProject\" (2007; 2014), no one bothered to find out. Instead, the NIEO's\noriginal failure was deemed sufficient evidence to prove its\npowerlessness. As a result, scholars and practitioners of development\nhave largely ignored this most pivotal moment, and the political\nstrategies that made it possible (<a class=\"in-text-citation\" href=\"#berger2014\">For a key exception: Berger and Weber\n2014, 14</a>).</p>",

It is only through such questions that\nconsciousness can use the past to guide decision making in the present.\nThis is made clear in the lead up to the Progressive International's\n2024 Havana Congress, when it asked: \"Should we form a club of debtor\nnations to navigate the crisis of sovereign debt?\" This fits a more\ngeneral tendency within the movement towards the NIEO's Nkrumahist\nstrategic tradition. By acknowledging that the original NIEO \"was won\nthrough the exercise of collective power in the coordinated production\nof petroleum\", the PI declares that its own \"vision today can only be\nrealized through the collective action of the South\". To explore such\nstrategic possibilities, Michael Galant (<a class=\"in-text-citation\" href=\"#galant2024\">2024</a>) considered the history of\nthe original NIEO, and concluded that \"even a united negotiating front\nis only as strong as its underlying balance of power\". For Galant, a\nmember of the PI's Executive Committee, the implication is that the\nmovement must create \"South-South collective action\" in the form of a\n\"new critical minerals cartel\" and a \"club of debtor nations\". As these\nstatements make clear, the Progressive International's current attempts\nat renovating the NIEO are based on a reconsideration of the exact\nstrategies that were sorely missed during the demise of the original.\nThe PI knows that it is not enough to simply seek a global\nconsensus.</p>",

Its <em>Havana Declaration</em> (2023)\ncalls for a global consensus, or a \"Planetary Bloc\" supported by \"all\npeoples and nations\". Perhaps most interestingly, however, is the fact\nthat some of the PI's leaders are drawing –– even if unwittingly –– on\nparts of Samir Amin's critique of the NIEO. Within the eclectic\nimaginaries of Yanis Varoufakis, the historical echos of both Prebisch\nand Amin can be heard in a new strategic synthesis. Like Amin's critique\nof \"sub-imperialism\" within the G77, Varoufakis (<a class=\"in-text-citation\" href=\"#varoufakis2023\">2023</a>) has argued the\nthe PI \"must not repeat the mistake\" of relying on \"the elites of the\nGlobal South\". He made this point with a counterfactual, arguing that:\n\"Our New Non-Aligned Movement will fail if we give it a narrow role of\nbringing together the G77 and the BRICS in opposition to the West.\"\nVaroufakis also reflects the NIEO's more moderate goals, even as\nPrebisch is sidelined for \"Green Keynesianism\" (<a class=\"in-text-citation\" href=\"#schwartz2023\">See also: Schwartz\n2023</a>). While believing like Prebisch that such reforms would address\ncapitalist crises, Varoufakis is skeptical that the capitalist class\nwill support \"the very road that leads to its own salvation.\" Instead,\nhe calls for “Genuine democracy” that will “be practised in the\ncitizens’ and the workers’ assemblies; not behind closed doors where\nsecretive oligarchs gather.” This is indicative of a key trend within\nthe PI's \"renovation\" of the NIEO. In this new, still somewhat implicit\nstrategy, the PI is attempting to empower a NIEO from below, via the its\nmovement of movements, or grass roots social forces.</p>",
