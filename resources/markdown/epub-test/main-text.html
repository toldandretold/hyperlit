Fifty years after the Sixth Special Session, the Progressive
International (PI) has declared a strategy of "renovating the NIEO".
However, key questions remain about the decisions that created and led
the original campaign. The NIEO's draft declarations were brought to the
UN General Assembly by the leaders of 95 states, caucused as the G77.
Their solidarity was necessarily pluralistic, drawing on Marxist and
Liberal visions of what Adom Getachew called “post-imperial
worldmaking”. This raises the question of how this global "common front"
was possible, and what the PI might do differently this time. As a
partial explanation, I compare two of the project's strategic
imaginaries, showing that they were successfully synthesised in
practice. As this legacy inspires the PI's focus on the possibilities of
sovereign debt crises, the NIEO continues to play an important
historical role. It alludes to possible options, or alternative futures,
of world order and global development.

This article is part of a Special Issue commemorating the fiftieth
anniversary of the campaign for a NIEO (UN <a
href="#index.xhtml_CIT0061" class="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref"
data-xml-rid="CIT0061">1974a</a>, <a href="#index.xhtml_CIT0060"
class="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref"
data-xml-rid="CIT0060">1974b</a>), but the project’s significance
transcends the past. Right now, the Progressive International (PI) is
seeking to “Renew the Non-Aligned Movement” and “Renovate the NIEO”
(Havana Congress <a href="#index.xhtml_CIT0011" class="biblioref"
role="doc-biblioref" data-xml-rid="CIT0011">2023</a>). The original
project attempted to resolve an uncertain world economic crisis through
a global consensus on the reformation of global trade, finance, and debt
(Murphy <a href="#index.xhtml_CIT0038" class="biblioref"
role="doc-biblioref" data-xml-rid="CIT0038">1984</a>; UN <a
href="#index.xhtml_CIT0061" class="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref"
data-xml-rid="CIT0061">1974a</a>). Its vision drew on longer, global
struggles against neo-colonialism and the declining terms of trade
(UNGAa, 4(j); UNGA <a href="#index.xhtml_CIT0061" class="biblioref"
role="doc-biblioref" data-xml-rid="CIT0061">1974b</a>, Chapter II,
Section 1(a): i–xii;), problems most famously articulated by Kwame
Nkrumah and Raúl Prebisch. The passing of the NIEO’s founding
declarations led to a wholesale reconsideration, across the entire
United Nations system, of the global architecture of development.
However, after the “assassination” of the NIEO during the so-called
Third World Debt Crisis (Prashad <a href="#index.xhtml_CIT0046"
class="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref" data-xml-rid="CIT0046">2007</a>),
these structural debates were silenced by a neo-colonial “common sense”.
For decades, development studies and the development industry have
largely assumed that “there is no alternative” to neo-liberal
globalisation (Berger and Weber <a href="#index.xhtml_CIT0004"
class="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref" data-xml-rid="CIT0004">2014</a>,
24–25, 81; Fisher <a href="#index.xhtml_CIT0019" class="biblioref"
role="doc-biblioref" data-xml-rid="CIT0019">1999</a>; Prashad <a
href="#index.xhtml_CIT0046" class="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref"
data-xml-rid="CIT0046">2007</a>, 214–219). The PI’s goal of renovating
the NIEO is a renewed attempt at creating precisely such alternatives.
</div>
<div role="paragraph">
Launched in May 2020, the PI is a movement of movements aiming to unite
progressive forces globally, and its NIEO campaign is based on a sober
assessment of the original. In calling to seize “the opportunity of the
present historical juncture”, its <em>Havana Declaration on the
NIEO</em> notes that “the crisis of the existing world system can either
entrench inequalities or embolden the call to reclaim Southern
protagonism” (Havana Congress <a href="#index.xhtml_CIT0011"
class="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref" data-xml-rid="CIT0011">2023</a>).
This is a lesson from the rise and decline of the solidarity of the
original NIEO campaign. Initially, when the Non-Aligned Movement
leveraged the new power of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting
Countries (OPEC), “Southern protagonism” was emboldened. However, it was
eventually crushed during the so-called Third World Debt Crisis. This
presents the Progressive International with the problem of
understanding, as Yanis Varoufakis (<a href="#index.xhtml_CIT0062"
class="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref" data-xml-rid="CIT0062">2023</a>)
has asked: “Why did we lose last time round?” Unfortunately, the
academic literature is still struggling to answer this question. Despite
the historical reconsideration of the NIEO that followed Vijay Prashad’s
pioneering histories of “the Third World Project” (Gilman <a
href="#index.xhtml_CIT0022" class="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref"
data-xml-rid="CIT0022">2015</a>, <a href="#index.xhtml_CIT0023"
class="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref" data-xml-rid="CIT0023">2023</a>;
Prashad <a href="#index.xhtml_CIT0046" class="biblioref"
role="doc-biblioref" data-xml-rid="CIT0046">2007</a>, <a
href="#index.xhtml_CIT0047" class="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref"
data-xml-rid="CIT0047">2014</a>; Schwartz <a href="#index.xhtml_CIT0053"
class="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref" data-xml-rid="CIT0053">2023</a>),
fundamental questions remain about the decision-making which created and
led the campaign (Thornton <a href="#index.xhtml_CIT0057"
class="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref" data-xml-rid="CIT0057">2022</a>;
Venzke <a href="#index.xhtml_CIT0063" class="biblioref"
role="doc-biblioref" data-xml-rid="CIT0063">2018</a>). This article
provides a partial and broad-brush answer. By relying on the method of
C.L.R. James, I trace the counterfactuals – or imagined “what if?”
scenarios – that animated two of the NIEO’s dominant strategies. That
is, the imagined futures which were used to devise and decide between
the available options. I then show how these strategic imaginaries were
synthesised, first theoretically and then in practice. Right now, the
same strategic imaginaries are inspiring the Progressive International’s
attempt at reviving the project. This proves, as Nils Gilman (<a
href="#index.xhtml_CIT0023" class="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref"
data-xml-rid="CIT0023">2023</a>, <a href="#index.xhtml_CIT0024"
class="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref" data-xml-rid="CIT0024">1976</a>)
has argued, that the NIEO is a “usable past”. It offers badly needed
alternatives to world order and global development.
</div>
<h2 id="index.xhtml_sec-1">Question of strategic decision-making</h2>
<div role="paragraph">
By the early 1980s, scholars began to realise that the core proposals of
the NIEO would not be implemented. Instead, G77 solidarity crumbled
amidst the so-called Third World Debt Crisis (Prashad <a
href="#index.xhtml_CIT0046" class="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref"
data-xml-rid="CIT0046">2007</a>, 210). In this climate, a near consensus
emerged among those who had once viewed it as either a serious threat or
opportunity (Cox <a href="#index.xhtml_CIT0013" class="biblioref"
role="doc-biblioref" data-xml-rid="CIT0013">1978</a>; Gosovic and Ruggie
<a href="#index.xhtml_CIT0024" class="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref"
data-xml-rid="CIT0024">1976</a>). From the imperialist Henry Kissinger
(<a href="#index.xhtml_CIT0032" class="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref"
data-xml-rid="CIT0032">1982</a>), to the theorist of embedded
liberalism, John Ruggie (Bhagwati and Ruggie <a
href="#index.xhtml_CIT0005" class="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref"
data-xml-rid="CIT0005">1984</a>), and the historical materialist Robert
W. Cox (<a href="#index.xhtml_CIT0014" class="biblioref"
role="doc-biblioref" data-xml-rid="CIT0014">1981</a>), all agreed. For
them, the demise of the NIEO proved that it had never stood a chance.
This dismissive consensus became the baseline assumption across the
social sciences, including in development studies.<a href="#fn1"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> The
pioneering global political economist, Susan Strange, went so far as to
describe the NIEO’s hopes as “an illusion” (Strange [<a
href="#index.xhtml_CIT0055" class="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref"
data-xml-rid="CIT0055">1988</a>] <a href="#index.xhtml_CIT0055"
class="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref" data-xml-rid="CIT0055">2015</a>,
263). In Gilbert Rist’s critique of development, he argued that the
NIEO’s ambivalent proposals do “no more than reinforce the existing
order of things” (<a href="#index.xhtml_CIT0049" class="biblioref"
role="doc-biblioref" data-xml-rid="CIT0049">2009</a>, 49–150). In other
words, it had no capacity for change. There is nothing wrong with these
conclusions, per se. The problem is that they were made without
historical research into the decision-making which had created and led
the project. To prove that the NIEO could never have succeeded, one must
understand the available options. Had G77 elites considered choices
which, if taken, might have led to more success? In short, no one knew,
and until Vijay Prashad’s pioneering histories of the “Third World
Project” (<a href="#index.xhtml_CIT0046" class="biblioref"
role="doc-biblioref" data-xml-rid="CIT0046">2007</a>, <a
href="#index.xhtml_CIT0047" class="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref"
data-xml-rid="CIT0047">2014</a>), no one bothered to find out. Instead,
the NIEO’s failure was assumed to be inevitable. As a result, scholars
and practitioners of development have largely ignored this most pivotal
moment, and the political strategies that made it possible. For a key
exception, see Berger and Weber (<a href="#index.xhtml_CIT0004"
class="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref" data-xml-rid="CIT0004">2014</a>,
14).
</div>
<div role="paragraph">
This dismissive consensus rested on a rejection of the counterfactual
analysis that is essential for making and understanding decisions.
Counterfactuals are imagined, “what if?” scenarios. For Robert W. Cox,
the rejection of counterfactuals was explicit. He viewed them as “the
stuff of idealism rather than of historical materialism” (Cox <a
href="#index.xhtml_CIT0015" class="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref"
data-xml-rid="CIT0015">1991</a>, 175). Without counterfactual analysis,
however, Cox was unable to properly consider the decision-making, and
therefore power, of the NIEO project. This can be appreciated by
considering the method of C.L.R. James, whose groundbreaking research
uncovered the previously neglected power that had created and led the
Haitian Revolution. In <em>The Black Jacobins</em> ( <a
href="#index.xhtml_CIT0031" class="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref"
data-xml-rid="CIT0031">[1938] 1989</a>), James explored the key
decisions made by the leaders of global social forces. To do so, he
relied extensively on counterfactuals. For example, he analysed not just
Napoleon’s decision to invade Haiti, but his deeply considered option
not to (James [<a href="#index.xhtml_CIT0031" class="biblioref"
role="doc-biblioref" data-xml-rid="CIT0031">1938] 1989</a>, 270–271,
373). This rested on a historical–empirical assessment of how Napoleon’s
advisors had imagined what would happen if each option were taken. This
allowed James to consider not just what happened, but what <em>might
have been if</em> things had been decided differently. For example,
James reasoned that with better leadership by Toussaint, the former
slave and revolutionary leader, Napoleon’s attack “would have been
crippled at the start” (299–300). From this position of strength,
Toussaint’s forces might have succeeded in forming an alliance with the
French republic (285). In doing so, James showed how imaginary “what
if?” scenarios are foundational to understanding decision-making and
power. To choose between option a, b, or c, a person imagines <em>what
would happen if</em> each option were taken. To understand the agency
that created and led the original NIEO, therefore, it is necessary to
search for the counterfactual logics that the project relied on, even if
implicitly. That means considering how the NIEO’s leaders answered a key
question: what would happen if NIEO-style reforms were implemented?
</div>
<div role="paragraph">
Of course, understanding the decision-making that created and led the
NIEO is difficult (Venzke <a href="#index.xhtml_CIT0063"
class="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref" data-xml-rid="CIT0063">2018</a>).
As C.L.R. James ([<a href="#index.xhtml_CIT0031" class="biblioref"
role="doc-biblioref" data-xml-rid="CIT0031">1938</a>] <a
href="#index.xhtml_CIT0031" class="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref"
data-xml-rid="CIT0031">1989</a>, x) was well aware, strategic options
are not imagined in a vacuum. Consciousness is embedded within
historical forces which it does not choose. The NIEO presents additional
difficulties, for it was created by political leaders and diplomats from
95 diverse states, who held contradictory beliefs about the
possibilities of changing the post-WWII world order (Byrne <a
href="#index.xhtml_CIT0009" class="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref"
data-xml-rid="CIT0009">2016</a>; Lal <a href="#index.xhtml_CIT0033"
class="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref" data-xml-rid="CIT0033">2015</a>;
Thornton <a href="#index.xhtml_CIT0057" class="biblioref"
role="doc-biblioref" data-xml-rid="CIT0057">2022</a>). This was shown
brilliantly in Adom Getachew’s (<a href="#index.xhtml_CIT0021"
class="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref" data-xml-rid="CIT0021">2019</a>)
<em>Worldmaking After Empire</em>, which offers a deep exploration of
the NIEO’s intellectual foundations. Getachew traced the project’s
ideological contradictions, including the fact that it had been “Marxist
in its diagnosis of economic dependence” but liberal in terms of its
prescriptions (<a href="#index.xhtml_CIT0021" class="biblioref"
role="doc-biblioref" data-xml-rid="CIT0021">2019</a>, 145). For
Getachew, this was only one of the project’s many “internal limitations
and inconsistencies”, which were only hidden because “external
challenges ensured that the project never had the opportunity for its
internal contradictions to unfold” (171). This argument is similar to
Cox’s original claim that the NIEO lacked “a sufficiently clear view of
an alternative world political economy” (Cox <a
href="#index.xhtml_CIT0014" class="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref"
data-xml-rid="CIT0014">1981</a>, 150–151), and to Henry Kissinger’s
claim that the NIEO’s “philosophical framework seems to me to be
extremely elusive” (<a href="#index.xhtml_CIT0032" class="biblioref"
role="doc-biblioref" data-xml-rid="CIT0032">1982</a>, 153). Others have
gone further, arguing that the group’s internal contradictions rendered
it incapable of negotiating its core demands (Narlikar <a
href="#index.xhtml_CIT0040" class="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref"
data-xml-rid="CIT0040">2003</a>, 58–69; Weiss <a
href="#index.xhtml_CIT0065" class="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref"
data-xml-rid="CIT0065">1986</a>, 6–7, 44–47). In other words, there
never were alternative options which G77 elites could have taken.
</div>
<div role="paragraph">
This theory that the original NIEO had been so marred by internal
disagreements, and so lacking in a coherent vision of an alternative,
raises the question of how the project had been possible in the first
place. How could so many different state elites, with deep ideological
and material conflicts, create a global solidarity that forced
imperialists – like Kissinger – to negotiate? For the astonishing thing
about the NIEO is not that it had so many ideological and material
contradictions. That is a necessary part of any global solidarity. What
is remarkable is that these contradictions were synthesised in praxis.
To show this, I draw on C.L.R. James’ counterfactual analysis to trace
the strategic imaginaries that inspired the decision-making of the
original NIEO. Of course, it is beyond the scope of this article to
consider the many decisions made by each individual G77 elite. Instead,
I trace the counterfactual logics used in two of the NIEO’s foundational
theories of global development, Kwame Nkrumah’s <em>Neocolonialism: The
Last Stage of Imperialism</em> (<a href="#index.xhtml_CIT0042"
class="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref" data-xml-rid="CIT0042">1965</a>),
and Raúl Prebisch’s <em>Towards a New Trade Policy for Development</em>
(<a href="#index.xhtml_CIT0048" class="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref"
data-xml-rid="CIT0048">1964</a>). Each text relied on distinct
counterfactual claims about what would happen if NIEO-style reforms were
implemented. Nkrumah devised several of the NIEO’s core proposals as
part of a wider strategy that would help to create global socialism.
Prebisch saw them as temporary measures that would help create a
properly functioning global capitalist system. Nevertheless, at the
level of world order, Nkrumah’s Leninism and Prebisch’s liberalism
overlapped (Nicholls <a href="#index.xhtml_CIT0041" class="biblioref"
role="doc-biblioref" data-xml-rid="CIT0041">2019</a>, 59–61). Even if
Nkrumah and Prebisch disagreed about what NIEO-style reforms to world
order would achieve, they both supported the reforms (Bockman <a
href="#index.xhtml_CIT0007" class="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref"
data-xml-rid="CIT0007">2015</a>). Here lies the theoretical basis, I
argue, for the non-aligned common front that created and led the
original NIEO campaign. This contradictory synthesis allowed the G77 to
win support from Leninists to Liberals, and anyone in between. Whether
one sought global socialism, or properly functioning global free trade,
there was a historical, and therefore counterfactual, case to be made
for NIEO-style reforms.
</div>
<div role="paragraph">
Of course, the common front’s divergent goals reflected contradictory
social forces (Amin <a href="#index.xhtml_CIT0001" class="biblioref"
role="doc-biblioref" data-xml-rid="CIT0001">1982</a>, 445; Prashad <a
href="#index.xhtml_CIT0046" class="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref"
data-xml-rid="CIT0046">2007</a>, 52). By envisioning, and seeking, a
properly functioning global capitalism, Prebisch believed NIEO-style
reforms would be equally beneficial to the core and periphery. This
implied a strategy of seeking a consensus with capitalist elites in the
core. Nkrumah disagreed. He thought the idea that “the developed nations

prospect” of taking place (Nkrumah <a href="#index.xhtml_CIT0042"
class="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref" data-xml-rid="CIT0042">1965</a>,
xix). He imagined that NIEO-style reforms would be damaging to the
interests of imperialists. Thus, instead of seeking global consensus,
non-aligned elites should forge collective independence. In practice,
both strategies were synthesised. First, OPEC elites acted in accordance
with Nkrumah’s strategic vision. Working collectively, they seized
control of the global oil market, which heightened the global crisis.
Then, this new power was used to call for the Sixth Special Session of
the UN General Assembly (Gwin [<a href="#index.xhtml_CIT0025"

accordance with the Prebischian strategy of seeking global consensus
(Bedjaoui <a href="#index.xhtml_CIT0003" class="biblioref"
role="doc-biblioref" data-xml-rid="CIT0003">1979</a>, 196–197). Thus,
collective independence that deepened global crisis was used to power
the possibility of a global consensus that benefitted the North and
South alike.

For C.L.R. James, the point of counterfactual analysis was not simply to
understand the history of past decision-making. It was to use this
history to inform strategic decision-making in the present. This meant
asking not just what could have been decided, but what should have been
(James [<a href="#index.xhtml_CIT0031" class="biblioref"
role="doc-biblioref" data-xml-rid="CIT0031">1938</a>] <a
href="#index.xhtml_CIT0031" class="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref"
data-xml-rid="CIT0031">1989</a>, 282). It is for this purpose that Yanis
Varoufakis (<a href="#index.xhtml_CIT0062" class="biblioref"
role="doc-biblioref" data-xml-rid="CIT0062">2023</a>) has called on the
PI to ask itself: “Why did we lose last time round?” Curiously, similar
questions were asked by Samir Amin (<a href="#index.xhtml_CIT0001"
class="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref" data-xml-rid="CIT0001">1982</a>)
during the project’s demise. Despite agreeing with the emerging
consensus that the NIEO had never stood a chance, Amin embraced
counterfactual analysis. This allowed him to ask key questions of the
project’s praxis, including whether it had failed because of “tactical
errors”, or unpredictable economic contingencies (Amin <a
href="#index.xhtml_CIT0001" class="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref"
data-xml-rid="CIT0001">1982</a>, 436). For Amin, there was nothing that
G77 elites could have done to avoid the destruction of the NIEO project.
In fact, he thought the G77’s “common front” had been dangerous. As
such, this article starts with Amin.
</div>
<h2 id="index.xhtml_sec-2">Samir Amin’s Leninist rejection of the
NIEO</h2>
<div role="paragraph">
Despite contributing to the scholarly consensus that the NIEO’s failure
was inevitable, Samir Amin’s historical materialism did not ignore
questions of the project’s decision-making. He asked whether “the
factors behind the clearly visible failure” were “purely contingent”
aspects of the economic crisis, or “traceable to the ‘tactical errors’
of the Third World” (Amin <a href="#index.xhtml_CIT0001"
class="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref" data-xml-rid="CIT0001">1982</a>,
436). Amin could consider decision-making because he was open to
counterfactual analysis (Patomäki <a href="#index.xhtml_CIT0044"
class="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref" data-xml-rid="CIT0044">2019</a>).
Indeed, his answer to these questions drew upon an imaginary “what if?”
scenario. He asked what it would mean if the G77 succeeded in
“transforming this dependency relationship and compelling the adjustment
of the world system”:
<blockquote>
<div role="paragraph">
If that should turn out to be the case one should be able to look back
on imperialism as merely a stage – an intermediate stage – in the
expansion of capitalism on a world scale and not as the highest stage of
capitalism; it would have proved, that is, as the stage that ushered in
the transition from a system characterised by the asymmetrical
centre–periphery relationships that define it to a homogeneous global
system dominated by capitalist relations (Amin <a
href="#index.xhtml_CIT0001" class="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref"
data-xml-rid="CIT0001">1982</a>, 441–442).
</div>
</blockquote>
In this sense, the NIEO project was an important experiment, which
tested the nature of imperialism itself. To explain why he thought the
project could never have succeeded, Amin constructed a theoretically
consistent account of imperialism, understood as a stage of capitalism
dominated by global monopoly capital. Within this Leninist imaginary,
the G77’s “common front” was defined by its ruling classes (Amin <a
href="#index.xhtml_CIT0001" class="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref"
data-xml-rid="CIT0001">1982</a>, 445). Thus, whereas some advocates
described the G77 as a group of “proletarian nations”, or a “trade union
of the poor” (Getachew <a href="#index.xhtml_CIT0021" class="biblioref"
role="doc-biblioref" data-xml-rid="CIT0021">2019</a>, 168; Mazrui [<a

<a href="#index.xhtml_CIT0052" class="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref"
data-xml-rid="CIT0052">2014</a>, 9), Amin defined them as a group of
“peripheral capitalist states and their bourgeoisies” (Amin <a
href="#index.xhtml_CIT0001" class="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref"
data-xml-rid="CIT0001">1982</a>, 432). In their struggle to
industrialise, the peripheral bourgeoisies were opposed by “the
monopolies and the imperialist states”. Despite this resistance to the
core, Amin noted that the NIEO “permits an increase in the rate of
profit on a world scale and can only be read therefore, as a
contribution to global capitalist development”. What’s more, Amin
pointed to the problem of “sub-imperialism” within the G77, and argued
that the NIEO had the “effect of turning the Third World into a fair
game for the rival superpowers” (<a href="#index.xhtml_CIT0001"
class="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref" data-xml-rid="CIT0001">1982</a>,
447–448).
</div>
<div role="paragraph">
Despite imagining the NIEO as both dangerous and ineffective, Amin did
not, like other historical materialists, ignore non-Western agency
(Hobson and Sajed <a href="#index.xhtml_CIT0029" class="biblioref"
role="doc-biblioref" data-xml-rid="CIT0029">2017</a>). To explain the
“atmosphere” which had made it “possible to contemplate” a NIEO, Amin
pointed to a global upsurge of popular forces across the Global South
(<a href="#index.xhtml_CIT0001" class="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref"
data-xml-rid="CIT0001">1982</a>, 439; see also: Berger and Weber <a

class="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref" data-xml-rid="CIT0046">2014</a>),
and predicted a “new wave of popular struggles” (447–448). Citing the
anti-colonial revolutions that had created the post-WWII world order,
Amin looked towards the future. “Not for the first time”, he argued,
“the peoples of the Third World may well lead the process of world
transformation” (447–448). This critique has important implications for
any project, like the Progressive International (PI), which seeks to
“renovate the NIEO”. For if the NIEO was a dangerous strategy, such
projects should focus instead on the development of domestic social
forces. However, other counterfactuals are possible.
</div>
<h2 id="index.xhtml_sec-3">Strategic imaginary of Kwame Nkrumah</h2>
<div role="paragraph">
Nkrumah agreed with Amin that imperialism was the final stage of
capitalism. His classic work on neo-colonialism had not revised Lenin’s
theory, but applied it to the post-WWII world order, a point which
Nkrumah made explicit:
<blockquote>
<div role="paragraph">
Colonialism has achieved a new guise. It has become neo-colonialism, the
last stage of imperialism; its final bid for existence, as
monopoly-capitalism or imperialism is the last stage of capitalism. (<a
href="#index.xhtml_CIT0042" class="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref"
data-xml-rid="CIT0042">1965</a>, 31)
</div>
</blockquote>
Thus, like Amin, Nkrumah understood the task of economic development in
the periphery as a struggle against “the empire of finance capital”
(35–36). Unlike Amin, Nkrumah (<a href="#index.xhtml_CIT0042"
class="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref" data-xml-rid="CIT0042">1965</a>,
32) adopted a working relationship with this empire, arguing that “it is
impossible for any of us to avoid dealing with monopoly in some form or
another”. He believed that with international solidarity, non-aligned
state elites could “maintain the integrity of our financial
institutions” and “leave ourselves room to manoeuvre away” from
neo-colonialism (Nkrumah <a href="#index.xhtml_CIT0042"
class="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref" data-xml-rid="CIT0042">1965</a>,
32). Here, his focus was on pan-Africanism, but he also supported “a
strengthening of the Afro-Asian Solidarity Organisation and the spirit
of Bandung”, as well as solidarity “on an increasingly formal basis”
with “our Latin American brothers” (Nkrumah <a
href="#index.xhtml_CIT0042" class="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref"
data-xml-rid="CIT0042">1965</a>, 253–254). Thus, whereas Amin criticised
the NIEO’s common-front strategy, Nkrumah helped create it. He argued
that newly independent states must act “in a combination that will give
strength to our bargaining power and eliminate so many of the
duplications that give greater force and greater advantage to the
imperialists and their strategy of neo-colonialism” (Nkrumah <a
href="#index.xhtml_CIT0042" class="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref"
data-xml-rid="CIT0042">1965</a>, 30–31).
</div>
<div role="paragraph">
In calling for international solidarity, Nkrumah had not opposed foreign
direct investment or free trade (Biney <a href="#index.xhtml_CIT0006"

Nkrumah did not believe these reforms would succeed in isolation, but
thought they would be useful. If implemented, they would mitigate the
worst effects of imperialism, boost economic development in the
periphery, and heighten the contradiction between capital and labour in
the imperial core (Nkrumah <a href="#index.xhtml_CIT0042"
class="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref" data-xml-rid="CIT0042">1965</a>,
255–256). Lenin (<a href="#index.xhtml_CIT0034" class="biblioref"
role="doc-biblioref" data-xml-rid="CIT0034">[1917] 2008</a>) had argued
that monopolistic “superprofits” allowed imperialists to “bribe the
labour leaders and the upper stratum of the labour aristocracy”. Nkrumah
built on this directly, reasoning that any mitigation of superprofits
would heighten class conflict in the core:
<blockquote>
<div role="paragraph">
When Africa becomes economically free and politically united, the
monopolists will come face to face with their own working class in their
own countries, and a new struggle will arise within which the
liquidation and collapse of imperialism will be complete. (<a
href="#index.xhtml_CIT0042" class="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref"
data-xml-rid="CIT0042">1965</a>, 255–256)
</div>
</blockquote>
Of course, Nkrumah never imagined that this would be possible solely
with NIEO-style reforms. Nor did he imagine that they would be won
through diplomatic consensus (Getachew <a href="#index.xhtml_CIT0021"
class="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref" data-xml-rid="CIT0021">2019</a>,
149–150). Within his imaginary, NIEO-style reforms would damage the
interests of imperialist elites. As such, Nkrumah focused on building
non-aligned coalitions, and regional ordering, like his proposed
“All-African Union Government” (Getachew <a href="#index.xhtml_CIT0021"
class="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref" data-xml-rid="CIT0021">2019</a>,
102; Nkrumah <a href="#index.xhtml_CIT0042" class="biblioref"
role="doc-biblioref" data-xml-rid="CIT0042">1965</a>, 35–36). This was
justified by an implicit counterfactual logic, or strategic imaginary.
For if NIEO-style reforms would assist economic development in the
periphery while heightening class contradictions in the imperial core,
then there was little chance of imperialist concessions. Instead,
non-aligned elites would have to create NIEO-style reforms and
institutions themselves. Importantly, this aspect of Nkrumah’s
<em>Neo-colonialism</em> isn’t found in the NIEO’s founding
declarations. These claimed that the NIEO would be just as beneficial to
the core as to the periphery. Nkrumah’s strategic imaginary should be
understood as operating beneath the surface of these formal, diplomatic
documents. Indeed, his strategy of collective independence was a core
part of the Non-Aligned Movement, and of what the NIEO’s advocates came
to call “collective self reliance” (Gwin [<a href="#index.xhtml_CIT0025"

collective independence that had underlined the NIEO’s initial moment of
possibility.
</div>
<h2 id="index.xhtml_sec-4">Raúl Prebisch’s strategy of a liberal
consensus</h2>
<div role="paragraph">
Whereas Nkrumah imagined NIEO-style reforms as useful for creating
global socialism, Prebisch believed they would help create a global
capitalism that functioned as it was already supposed to. As his report
as the founding Secretary General of UNCTAD made clear, Prebisch sought
to achieve this by reforming the post-WWII Bretton Woods system from
within. Take, for example, his criticism of the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade (GATT), the precursor to the World Trade Organisation
(WTO). Prebisch didn’t oppose its core goal of promoting free trade, but
its historical blindness. It ignored the fact that the benefits of free
trade did not apply between “the industrially advanced and the
developing countries” (Bockman <a href="#index.xhtml_CIT0007"
class="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref" data-xml-rid="CIT0007">2015</a>,
115; Prebisch <a href="#index.xhtml_CIT0048" class="biblioref"
role="doc-biblioref" data-xml-rid="CIT0048">1964</a>, 29). For, as
Prebisch established alongside Hans Singer, exports from the periphery
showed a long-term tendency to decline relative to their industrial
imports (Toye and Toye <a href="#index.xhtml_CIT0058" class="biblioref"
role="doc-biblioref" data-xml-rid="CIT0058">2003</a>). Thus, if the
GATT’s rules and norms were applied equally between the core and
periphery, they would constrain, rather than help, economic development
(Prebisch <a href="#index.xhtml_CIT0048" class="biblioref"
role="doc-biblioref" data-xml-rid="CIT0048">1964</a>). To amend this,
Prebisch sought to unify the newly formed G77 behind a set of reforms
aimed at supporting peripheral industrialisation (Dosman <a
href="#index.xhtml_CIT0017" class="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref"
data-xml-rid="CIT0017">2008</a>, 394–395). These measures included a
real transfer of wealth from the core to the periphery and the
establishment of commodity agreements to regulate and increase the price
of peripheral exports. Like Nkrumah, Prebisch never believed that these
reforms would be sufficient. He made this point with a counterfactual,
imagining that:
<blockquote>
<div role="paragraph">
If the peripheral countries manage to secure a larger share for their
primary exports in the consumption of the industrial countries, this,
together with the transfer of income from the latter countries to the
former to offset the effects of the deterioration in the terms of trade,
will help to narrow the trade gap but will not in itself be enough to
close it. (Prebisch <a href="#index.xhtml_CIT0048" class="biblioref"
role="doc-biblioref" data-xml-rid="CIT0048">1964</a>, 20)
</div>
</blockquote>
What’s more, none of Prebisch’s proposed reforms were intended to be
permanent (<a href="#index.xhtml_CIT0048" class="biblioref"
role="doc-biblioref" data-xml-rid="CIT0048">1964</a>, 31). As peripheral
industrialisation grew, the “disparity” with the core “can be levelled
out gradually” (Prebisch <a href="#index.xhtml_CIT0048"
class="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref" data-xml-rid="CIT0048">1964</a>,
31). Indeed, Prebisch wrote that: “With an effort of the imagination it
is possible to visualise a situation of dynamic equilibrium in the
distant future in which [the declining terms of trade] disappears as a
result of the world-wide process of industrialization” (Prebisch <a
href="#index.xhtml_CIT0048" class="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref"
data-xml-rid="CIT0048">1964</a>, 15).
</div>
<div role="paragraph">
Here lies the biggest difference between Prebisch and Nkrumah. For
Prebisch, NIEO-style reforms would not significantly threaten the
profits of state elites from the global North. For these were not
radical nor permanent reforms, and would have the effect of increasing
economic development in both the core and periphery. This had important
strategic implications. If true, the G77 could create global reforms to
world order through “joint responsibilities, common objectives, and
convergent measures” (Prebisch <a href="#index.xhtml_CIT0048"
class="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref" data-xml-rid="CIT0048">1964</a>,
183). This strategic imaginary was a fundamental part the NIEO’s
founding declarations, which claimed that it would help both North and
South alike (UN <a href="#index.xhtml_CIT0059" class="biblioref"
role="doc-biblioref" data-xml-rid="CIT0059">1974a</a>). It also shaped
the G77’s legal strategy, which sought to reform the United Nations from
within, on the basis of global consensus (Bedjaoui <a
href="#index.xhtml_CIT0003" class="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref"
data-xml-rid="CIT0003">1979</a>, 196–197). It is this moderate tendency
that scholars have used to describe the NIEO as an essentially
“Keynesian liberal” project (Murphy <a href="#index.xhtml_CIT0039"
class="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref" data-xml-rid="CIT0039">2005</a>,

<h2 id="index.xhtml_sec-5">Decision-making: the strategic imaginaries in
practice</h2>
<div role="paragraph">
So far, this article has shown that Nkrumah and Prebisch contributed
conflicting visions of what would happen if NIEO-style reforms were
implemented. The counterfactual logic underlying these imaginaries had a
direct bearing on the strategies each leader helped create. The more
radical strategy of collective independence was promoted within the NAM,
which Nkrumah helped found (Gwin [<a href="#index.xhtml_CIT0025"

class="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref" data-xml-rid="CIT0052">2014</a>,
5). The more moderate strategy of seeking a global consensus was
promoted within UNCTAD and the G77, which Prebisch had helped lead
(Prebisch <a href="#index.xhtml_CIT0048" class="biblioref"
role="doc-biblioref" data-xml-rid="CIT0048">1964</a>, 183; Thomas <a
href="#index.xhtml_CIT0056" class="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref"
data-xml-rid="CIT0056">1985</a>, 126–127). In this section, I show how
these strategies related to the rise and decline of the original NIEO.
That means asking how, in key turning points, G77 elites chose between
the strategies of global consensus and collective, non-aligned
independence. I argue that the non-aligned common front was originally
empowered by a synthesis of both strategies. Initially, in late 1973,
Western elites used the petrodollar crisis as a pretext to end the IMF’s
“radical” attempt at creating “a quantum jump into a new [monetary]
system” (IMF <a href="#index.xhtml_CIT0030" class="biblioref"

response, Algerian president Houari Boumédiène leveraged OPEC’s new

collective independence, via the NAM and OPEC, was used to empower the
strategy of reaching a global consensus within the UN General Assembly
(UNGA <a href="#index.xhtml_CIT0061" class="biblioref"
role="doc-biblioref" data-xml-rid="CIT0061">1974a</a>, <a
href="#index.xhtml_CIT0060" class="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref"
data-xml-rid="CIT0060">1974b</a>).
</div>
<div role="paragraph">
This strategic synthesis, which empowered the NIEO’s initial moment of
possibility, peaked at the Seventh Special Session in September 1975. At
this time, the world economic crisis had been marked by continued
uncertainty, and a decline in the value of the recently floated
US-dollar. This reduced the value of OPEC’s petrodollar surpluses, and
made OPEC’s (<a href="#index.xhtml_CIT0043" class="biblioref"
role="doc-biblioref" data-xml-rid="CIT0043">1975</a>) <em>Solemn
Declaration</em> all the more believable. In it, OPEC heads of state
explicitly tied their oil and financial power to the goal of a NIEO.
This had an obvious effect. In the lead up to the Seventh Special
Session, CIA analysts feared what they called “the radicals, led by
Algeria” (CIA <a href="#index.xhtml_CIT0010" class="biblioref"
role="doc-biblioref" data-xml-rid="CIT0010">1975</a>). Because the
radicals wanted “a big transfer of resources” and “have a lot of power”,
the CIA argued that a “compromise may need to be struck in regards to
commodities”. This accords with Kissinger’s strategy at the Special
Session, which projected what appeared like a genuine willingness to
compromise (Dietrich <a href="#index.xhtml_CIT0016" class="biblioref"
role="doc-biblioref" data-xml-rid="CIT0016">2017</a>, 284–289; Gosovic

Sargent <a href="#index.xhtml_CIT0050" class="biblioref"
role="doc-biblioref" data-xml-rid="CIT0050">2015</a>). However, by the
end of the Paris Conference on International Economic Cooperation (CIEC)
in 1977, the exchange rate of the US-dollar seemed to have stabilised.
As such, OPEC’s capital appeared relatively more stable within a US-led
order, and the option of investing in the NIEO became relatively riskier
(Nicholls <a href="#index.xhtml_CIT0041" class="biblioref"
role="doc-biblioref" data-xml-rid="CIT0041">2019</a>, 146–149). Through
massive increases in US arms sales, Iran and Saudi Arabia chose instead
to strengthen ties with imperialism (Brzoska and Ohlson <a
href="#index.xhtml_CIT0008" class="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref"
data-xml-rid="CIT0008">1987</a>, 343–348; Dietrich <a

href="#index.xhtml_CIT0066" class="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref"
data-xml-rid="CIT0066">2014</a>). As a result, US negotiators dropped
their apparent willingness to compromise. Indeed, at the CIEC, they
dismissed all concerns about the growing debt crisis, claiming that it
would fix itself (UNA <a href="#index.xhtml_CIT0059" class="biblioref"
role="doc-biblioref" data-xml-rid="CIT0059">1976</a>; Nicholls <a
href="#index.xhtml_CIT0041" class="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref"
data-xml-rid="CIT0041">2019</a>, 150–151). With the conference ending in
failure, G77 solidarity collapsed.
</div>
<div role="paragraph">
The rise and decline of this original strategic synthesis raises two
counterfactual questions. First, as Samir Amin considered in 1982, is
the question of unpredictable economic contingencies. What if the
economic crisis had deepened, from 1975 to 1977, rather than apparently
stabilising? Would key OPEC elites have then been more likely to finance
experiments in the NIEO, like UNCTAD’s proposed Common Fund? Even if the
Common Fund failed to underlie a new wave of commodity price agreements,
it seems likely that significant OPEC investment would have boosted G77
solidarity, for it would have legitimised the strategic synthesis that
had made the NIEO project possible in the first place. Secondly, if G77
solidarity had been strengthened before the debt crisis, could the group
have formed a debtors’ cartel, as proposed by Cuba (Prashad <a
href="#index.xhtml_CIT0046" class="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref"
data-xml-rid="CIT0046">2007</a>, 214–219)? The counterfactual of a
debtors’ cartel is tantalising because of how close the world economic
crisis came, even without a cartel, to collapsing the US financial
system (Corbridge <a href="#index.xhtml_CIT0012" class="biblioref"
role="doc-biblioref" data-xml-rid="CIT0012">1993</a>, 44–45; Helleiner
<a href="#index.xhtml_CIT0027" class="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref"
data-xml-rid="CIT0027">1996</a>, 176; Mazower <a
href="#index.xhtml_CIT0035" class="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref"
data-xml-rid="CIT0035">2013</a>, 351). To avoid a collapse, US state and
financial elites employed their own strategy of collective independence,
wielding the full weight of their monopoly finance capital to quash
economic development in South America and Africa for over a decade
(Bazbauers and Engel <a href="#index.xhtml_CIT0002" class="biblioref"
role="doc-biblioref" data-xml-rid="CIT0002">2021</a>; Easterly <a
href="#index.xhtml_CIT0018" class="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref"
data-xml-rid="CIT0018">2001</a>; Harvey <a href="#index.xhtml_CIT0026"
class="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref" data-xml-rid="CIT0026">2005</a>,
29; Prashad <a href="#index.xhtml_CIT0047" class="biblioref"
role="doc-biblioref" data-xml-rid="CIT0047">2014</a>, 5–7; Stewart <a
href="#index.xhtml_CIT0054" class="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref"
data-xml-rid="CIT0054">2012</a>, 88, 92; Thomas <a
href="#index.xhtml_CIT0056" class="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref"
data-xml-rid="CIT0056">1985</a>, 149). With a debtors’ cartel, things
might have happened differently. By risking a systemic collapse of the
still-bourgeoning neo-liberal world disorder, a debtors’ cartel could
have forced the North–South dialogue back to the future of the early
1970s, when most global elites still supported a reformed Bretton Woods
(De Vries and Garritsen <a href="#index.xhtml_CIT0064" class="biblioref"
role="doc-biblioref" data-xml-rid="CIT0064">1985</a>, 242–243, 255–256).
Thus, again, the strategic synthesis between the NIEO’s more radical,
non-aligned strategy, and its more moderate, consensus-seeking strategy,
would have helped decide the future of world order and global
development.
</div>
<div role="paragraph">
Of course, such counterfactual scenarios are imaginary, so can’t be
tested with historical research. Still, as C.L.R. James argued, the
point of analysing historical decision-making is not just to understand
what actually could have been decided, but to understand what “should”
have been ([<a href="#index.xhtml_CIT0031" class="biblioref"
role="doc-biblioref" data-xml-rid="CIT0031">1938</a>]1989, 282). It is
only through such questions that consciousness can use the past to guide
decision-making in the present. This is made clear in the lead up to the
Progressive International’s (<a href="#index.xhtml_CIT0045"
class="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref" data-xml-rid="CIT0045">2024</a>)
Havana Congress, when it asked: “Should we form a club of debtor nations
to navigate the crisis of sovereign debt?” This fits a more general
tendency within the movement towards the NIEO’s Nkrumahist strategic
tradition. By acknowledging that the original NIEO “was won through the
exercise of collective power in the coordinated production of
petroleum”, the PI declares that its own “vision today can only be
realized through the collective action of the South”. To explore such
strategic possibilities, Michael Galant (<a href="#index.xhtml_CIT0020"
class="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref" data-xml-rid="CIT0020">2024</a>)
considered the history of the original NIEO, and concluded that “even a
united negotiating front is only as strong as its underlying balance of
power”. For Galant, a member of the PI’s Executive Committee, the
implication is that the movement must create “South-South collective
action” in the form of a “new critical minerals cartel” and a “club of
debtor nations”. As these statements make clear, the Progressive
International’s current attempts at renovating the NIEO are based on a
reconsideration of the exact strategies that were sorely missed during
the demise of the original. The PI knows that it is not enough to simply
seek a global consensus.
</div>
<div role="paragraph">
Still, the PI has not, for this reason, ignored the NIEO’s more
Prebischian goals and strategies. Its <em>Havana Declaration</em> (2023)
calls for a global consensus, or a “Planetary Bloc” supported by “all
peoples and nations”. Perhaps most interesting, however, is the fact
that some of the PI’s leaders are drawing – even if unwittingly – on
parts of Samir Amin’s critique of the NIEO. Within the eclectic
imaginaries of Yanis Varoufakis, the historical echoes of both Prebisch
and Amin can be heard in a new strategic synthesis. Like Amin’s critique
of “sub-imperialism” within the G77, Varoufakis (<a
href="#index.xhtml_CIT0062" class="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref"
data-xml-rid="CIT0062">2023</a>) has argued the PI “must not repeat the
mistake” of relying on “the elites of the Global South”. He made this
point with a counterfactual, arguing that: “Our New Non-Aligned Movement
will fail if we give it a narrow role of bringing together the G77 and
the BRICS in opposition to the West”. Varoufakis also reflects the
NIEO’s more moderate goals, even as Prebisch is sidelined for “Green
Keynesianism” (see also Schwartz <a href="#index.xhtml_CIT0053"
class="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref" data-xml-rid="CIT0053">2023</a>).
While believing, like Prebisch, that such reforms would address
capitalist crises, Varoufakis is sceptical that the capitalist class
will support “the very road that leads to its own salvation”. Instead,
he calls for “Genuine democracy” that will “be practised in the
citizens’ and the workers’ assemblies; not behind closed doors where
secretive oligarchs gather”. This is indicative of a key trend within
the PI’s “renovation” of the NIEO. In this new, still somewhat implicit
strategy, the PI is attempting to empower an NIEO from below, via its
movement of movements, or grass roots social forces.

<section id="index.xhtml_sec-6" data-type="conclusions">
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<div role="paragraph">
By focusing on the counterfactual logic used by Amin, Nkrumah, and
Prebisch, this article traced the broad strategies that underlined the
original NIEO, and which continue to shape the PI’s efforts to
“renovate” the project. This is important for both development studies
and the development industry, which have largely assumed that “there is
no alternative” to neo-liberal globalisation. The history of the
original NIEO, and the work of the PI, challenges these assumptions, for
both projects reflect real alternatives, or different strategic options.
The original NIEO failed to meet its stated objectives, but in many
ways, it succeeded. It succeeded in creating a global solidarity which
possessed powerful decision-making options. As such, key questions
remain about what would have happened if its power had been used
differently. As the NIEO was undermined during a global debt crisis, the
PI reconsiders the possibilities of a debtors’ cartel. Thus, just like
with the original NIEO, the PI hopes to use collective independence to
empower global reforms built on consensus. If chosen on a sufficiently
global scale, during an acute global crisis, such strategic syntheses
might again shape the future of global development. They might again
create possibilities for the structural transformation of
neo-colonialism, the highest stage of monopoly capitalism.
