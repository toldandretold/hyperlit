<span class="verse" id="E11_1">1 </span><a class="noteref" epub:type="noteref" href="#FN1">✡</a>Josias held the Passover in Jerusalem to his Lord, and offered the Passover the fourteenth day of the first month,  
<span class="verse" id="E11_2">2 </span>having set the priests according to their daily courses, being arrayed in their vestments, in the Lord’s temple.  
<span class="verse" id="E11_3">3 </span>He spoke to the Levites, <a class="noteref" epub:type="noteref" href="#FN2">✡</a>the temple servants of Israel, that they should make themselves holy to the Lord, to set the holy ark of the Lord in the house that King Solomon the son of David had built.  
<span class="verse" id="E11_4">4 </span>He said, “You no longer need to carry it on your shoulders. Now therefore serve the Lord your God, and minister to his people Israel, and prepare yourselves by your fathers’ houses and kindred,  
<span class="verse" id="E11_5">5 </span>according to the writing of King David of Israel, and according to the magnificence of Solomon his son. Stand in the holy place according to the divisions of your Levite families who minister in the presence of your kindred the descendants of Israel.  
<span class="verse" id="E11_6">6 </span>Offer the Passover in order, prepare the sacrifices for your kindred, and keep the Passover according to the Lord’s commandment, which was given to Moses.   </div>
<div class="p">
<span class="verse" id="E11_7">7 </span>To the people which were present, Josias gave thirty thousand lambs and kids, and three thousand calves. These things were given from the king’s possessions, as he promised, to the people and to the priests and Levites.  
<span class="verse" id="E11_8">8 </span>Helkias, Zacharias, and <a class="noteref" epub:type="noteref" href="#FN3">*</a>Esyelus, the rulers of the temple, gave to the priests for the Passover two thousand six hundred sheep, and three hundred calves.  
<span class="verse" id="E11_9">9 </span>Jeconias, Samaias, Nathanael his brother, Sabias, Ochielus, and Joram, captains over thousands, gave to the Levites for the Passover five thousand sheep and seven hundred calves.   </div>
<div class="p">
<span class="verse" id="E11_10">10 </span>When these things were done, the priests and Levites, having the unleavened bread, stood in proper order according to the kindred,  
<span class="verse" id="E11_11">11 </span>and according to the several divisions by fathers’ houses, before the people, to offer to the Lord as it is written in the book of Moses. They did this in the morning.  
<span class="verse" id="E11_12">12 </span>They roasted the Passover lamb with fire, as required. They boiled the sacrifices in the brazen vessels and caldrons with a pleasing smell,  
<span class="verse" id="E11_13">13 </span>and set them before all the people. Afterward they prepared for themselves and for their kindred the priests, the sons of Aaron.  
<span class="verse" id="E11_14">14 </span>For the priests offered the fat until night. The Levites prepared for themselves and for their kindred the priests, the sons of Aaron.  
<span class="verse" id="E11_15">15 </span>The holy singers also, the sons of Asaph, were in their order, according to the appointment of David: Asaph, Zacharias, and Eddinus, who represented the king.  
<span class="verse" id="E11_16">16 </span>Moreover the gatekeepers were at every gate. No one needed to depart from his daily duties, for their kindred the Levites prepared for them.   </div>
<div class="p">
<span class="verse" id="E11_17">17 </span>So the things that belonged to the Lord’s sacrifices were accomplished in that day, in holding the Passover,  
<span class="verse" id="E11_18">18 </span>and offering sacrifices on the altar of the Lord, according to the commandment of King Josias.  
<span class="verse" id="E11_19">19 </span>So the children of Israel which were present at that time held the Passover and the feast of unleavened bread seven days.  
<span class="verse" id="E11_20">20 </span>Such a Passover had not been held in Israel since the time of the prophet Samuel.  
<span class="verse" id="E11_21">21 </span>Indeed, none of the kings of Israel held such a Passover as Josias with the priests, the Levites, and the Jews, held with all Israel that were present in their dwelling place at Jerusalem.  
<span class="verse" id="E11_22">22 </span>This Passover was held in the eighteenth year of the reign of Josias.  
<span class="verse" id="E11_23">23 </span>The works of Josias were upright before his Lord with a heart full of godliness.  
<span class="verse" id="E11_24">24 </span>Moreover the things that came to pass in his days have been written in times past, concerning those who sinned and did wickedly against the Lord more than any other people or kingdom, and how they grieved him <a class="noteref" epub:type="noteref" href="#FN4">†</a>exceedingly, so that the Lord’s words were confirmed against Israel.   </div>
<div class="p">
<span class="verse" id="E11_25">25 </span><a class="noteref" epub:type="noteref" href="#FN5">✡</a>Now after all these acts of Josias, it came to pass that Pharaoh the king of Egypt came to make war at Carchemish on the Euphrates; and Josias went out against him.  
<span class="verse" id="E11_26">26 </span>But the king of Egypt sent to him, saying, “What do I have to do with you, O king of Judea?  
<span class="verse" id="E11_27">27 </span>I wasn’t sent out from the Lord God against you, for my war is against the Euphrates. Now the Lord is with me, yes, the Lord is with me hastening me forward. Depart from me, and don’t be against the Lord.”   </div>
<div class="p">
<span class="verse" id="E11_28">28 </span>However, Josias didn’t turn back to his chariot, but tried to fight with him, not regarding the words of the prophet Jeremy from the Lord’s mouth,  
<span class="verse" id="E11_29">29 </span>but joined battle with him in the plain of Megiddo, and the commanders came down against King Josias.  
<span class="verse" id="E11_30">30 </span>Then the king said to his servants, “Carry me away out of the battle, for I am very weak!” Immediately his servants carried him away out of the army.  
<span class="verse" id="E11_31">31 </span>Then he got into his second chariot. After he was brought back to Jerusalem he died, and was buried in the tomb of his ancestors.  
<span class="verse" id="E11_32">32 </span>All Judea mourned for Josias. Jeremy the prophet lamented for Josias, and the chief men with the women made lamentation for him to this day. This was given out for an ordinance to be done continually in all the nation of Israel.  
<span class="verse" id="E11_33">33 </span>These things are written in the book of the histories of the kings of Judea, and every one of the acts that Josias did, and his glory, and his understanding in the law of the Lord, and the things that he had done before, and the things now told, are reported in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah.   </div>
<div class="p">
<span class="verse" id="E11_34">34 </span><a class="noteref" epub:type="noteref" href="#FN6">✡</a> The people took <a class="noteref" epub:type="noteref" href="#FN7">‡</a>Joachaz the son of Josias, and made him king instead of Josias his father, when he was twenty-three years old.  
<span class="verse" id="E11_35">35 </span>He reigned in Judah and Jerusalem for three months. Then the king of Egypt deposed him from reigning in Jerusalem.  
<span class="verse" id="E11_36">36 </span>He set a tax upon the people of one hundred talents of silver and one talent of gold.  
<span class="verse" id="E11_37">37 </span>The king of Egypt also made King Joakim his brother king of Judea and Jerusalem.  
<span class="verse" id="E11_38">38 </span>And Joakim imprisoned the nobles and apprehended his brother Zarakes, and brought him up out of Egypt.   </div>
<div class="p">
<span class="verse" id="E11_39">39 </span><a class="noteref" epub:type="noteref" href="#FN8">✡</a>Joakim was twenty-five years old when he began to reign in Judea and Jerusalem. He did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord.  
<span class="verse" id="E11_40">40 </span>King Nabuchodonosor of Babylon came up against him, bound him with a chain of brass, and carried him to Babylon.  
<span class="verse" id="E11_41">41 </span>Nabuchodonosor also took some of the Lord’s holy vessels, carried them away, and stored them in his own temple at Babylon.  
<span class="verse" id="E11_42">42 </span>But those things that are reported of him, and of his uncleanness and impiety, are written in the chronicles of the kings.  
<span class="verse" id="E11_43">43 </span>Then Joakim his son reigned in his place. When he was made king, he was eighteen years old.  
<span class="verse" id="E11_44">44 </span>He reigned three months and ten days in Jerusalem. He did that which was evil before the Lord.   </div>
<div class="p">
<span class="verse" id="E11_45">45 </span>So after a year Nabuchodonosor sent and caused him to be brought to Babylon with the holy vessels of the Lord,  
<span class="verse" id="E11_46">46 </span>and made Sedekias king of Judea and Jerusalem when he was twenty-one years old. He reigned eleven years.  
<span class="verse" id="E11_47">47 </span>He also did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord, and didn’t heed the words that were spoken by Jeremy the prophet from the Lord’s mouth.  
<span class="verse" id="E11_48">48 </span>After King Nabuchodonosor had made him to swear by the name of the Lord, he broke his oath and rebelled. Hardening his neck and his heart, he transgressed the laws of the Lord, the God of Israel.  
<span class="verse" id="E11_49">49 </span>Moreover the governors of the people and of the priests did many things wickedly, exceeding all the defilements of all nations, and defiled the temple of the Lord, which was sanctified in Jerusalem.  
<span class="verse" id="E11_50">50 </span>The God of their ancestors sent by his messenger to call them back, because he had compassion on them and on his dwelling place.  
<span class="verse" id="E11_51">51 </span>But they mocked his messengers. In the day when the Lord spoke, they scoffed at his prophets  
<span class="verse" id="E11_52">52 </span>until he, being angry with his people for their great ungodliness, commanded to bring up the kings of the Chaldeans against them.  
<span class="verse" id="E11_53">53 </span>They killed their young men with the sword around their holy temple, and spared neither young man or young woman, old man or child; but he delivered all of them into their hands.  
<span class="verse" id="E11_54">54 </span>They took all the holy vessels of the Lord, both great and small, with the treasure chests of the Lord’s ark and the king’s treasures, and carried them away to Babylon.  
<span class="verse" id="E11_55">55 </span>They burned the Lord’s house, broke down Jerusalem’s walls, and burned its towers with fire.  
<span class="verse" id="E11_56">56 </span>As for her glorious things, they didn’t stop until they had brought them all to nothing. He carried the people who weren’t slain with the sword to Babylon.  
<span class="verse" id="E11_57">57 </span>They were servants to him and to his children until the Persians reigned, to fulfill the word of the Lord by the mouth of Jeremy:  
<span class="verse" id="E11_58">58 </span>“Until the land has enjoyed its Sabbaths, the whole time of her desolation shall she keep Sabbath, to fulfill seventy years.    </div>

<span class="verse" id="E12_2">2 </span>the Lord stirred up the spirit of King Cyrus of the Persians, and he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom, and also by writing,  
<span class="verse" id="E12_3">3 </span>saying, “Cyrus king of the Persians says: The Lord of Israel, the Most High Lord, has made me king of the whole world,  
<span class="verse" id="E12_4">4 </span>and commanded me to build him a house at Jerusalem that is in Judea.  
<span class="verse" id="E12_5">5 </span>If therefore there are any of you that are of his people, let the Lord, even his Lord, be with him, and let him go up to Jerusalem that is in Judea, and build the house of the Lord of Israel. He is the Lord who dwells in Jerusalem.  
<span class="verse" id="E12_6">6 </span>Therefore, of those who dwell in various places, let those who are in his own place help each one with gold, with silver,  
<span class="verse" id="E12_7">7 </span>with gifts, with horses, and cattle, beside the other things which have been added by vow for the temple of the Lord which is in Jerusalem.   </div>
<div class="p">
<span class="verse" id="E12_8">8 </span>Then the chief of the families of Judah and of the tribe of Benjamin stood up, with the priests, the Levites, and all whose spirit the Lord had stirred to go up, to build the house for the Lord which is in Jerusalem.  
<span class="verse" id="E12_9">9 </span>Those who lived around them helped them in all things with silver and gold, with horses and cattle, and with very many gifts that were vowed by a great number whose minds were so moved.   </div>
<div class="p">
<span class="verse" id="E12_10">10 </span>King Cyrus also brought out the holy vessels of the Lord, which Nabuchodonosor had carried away from Jerusalem and had stored in his temple of idols.  
<span class="verse" id="E12_11">11 </span>Now when King Cyrus of the Persians had brought them out, he delivered them to Mithradates his treasurer,  
<span class="verse" id="E12_12">12 </span>and by him they were delivered to <a class="noteref" epub:type="noteref" href="#FN10">*</a>Sanabassar the governor of Judea.  
<span class="verse" id="E12_13">13 </span>This was the number of them: one thousand gold cups, one thousand silver cups, twenty-nine silver censers, thirty gold bowls, two thousand four hundred ten silver bowls, and one thousand other vessels.  
<span class="verse" id="E12_14">14 </span>So all the vessels of gold and of silver were brought up, even five thousand four hundred seventy-nine,  
<span class="verse" id="E12_15">15 </span>and were carried back by Sanabassar, together with the returning exiles, from Babylon to Jerusalem.   </div>
<div class="p">
<span class="verse" id="E12_16">16 </span><a class="noteref" epub:type="noteref" href="#FN11">✡</a>In the time of King Artaxerxes of the Persians, Belemus, Mithradates, Tabellius, <a class="noteref" epub:type="noteref" href="#FN12">†</a>Rathumus, Beeltethmus, and <a class="noteref" epub:type="noteref" href="#FN13">‡</a>Samellius the scribe, with their other associates, dwelling in Samaria and other places, wrote to him against those who lived in Judea and Jerusalem the following letter:   </div>
<div class="p">
<span class="verse" id="E12_17">17 </span>“To King Artaxerxes our Lord, from your servants, Rathumus the recorder, Samellius the scribe, and the rest of their council, and the judges who are in Coelesyria and Phoenicia:  
<span class="verse" id="E12_18">18 </span>Let it now be known to our lord the king, that the Jews that have come up from you to us, having come to Jerusalem, are building that rebellious and wicked city, and are repairing its marketplaces and walls, and are laying the foundation of a temple.  
<span class="verse" id="E12_19">19 </span>Now if this city is built and its walls are finished, they will not only refuse to give tribute, but will even stand up against kings.  
<span class="verse" id="E12_20">20 </span>Since the things pertaining to the temple are now in hand, we think it appropriate not to neglect such a matter,  
<span class="verse" id="E12_21">21 </span>but to speak to our lord the king, to the intent that, if it is your pleasure, search may be made in the books of your ancestors.  
<span class="verse" id="E12_22">22 </span>You will find in the chronicles what is written concerning these things, and will understand that that city was rebellious, troubling both kings and cities,  
<span class="verse" id="E12_23">23 </span>and that the Jews were rebellious, and kept starting wars there in the past. For this cause, this city was laid waste.  
<span class="verse" id="E12_24">24 </span>Therefore now we do declare to you, O lord the king, that if this city is built again, and its walls set up again, you will from then on have no passage into Coelesyria and Phoenicia.”   </div>
<div class="p">
<span class="verse" id="E12_25">25 </span>Then the king wrote back again to Rathumus the recorder, Beeltethmus, Samellius the scribe, and to the rest that of their associates who lived in Samaria, Syria, and Phoenicia, as follows:   </div>
<div class="p">
<span class="verse" id="E12_26">26 </span>“I have read the letter which you have sent to me. Therefore I commanded to make search, and it has been found that that city of old time has fought against kings,  
<span class="verse" id="E12_27">27 </span>and the men were given to rebellion and war in it, and that mighty and fierce kings were in Jerusalem, who reigned and exacted tribute in Coelesyria and Phoenicia.  
<span class="verse" id="E12_28">28 </span>Now therefore I have commanded to prevent those men from building the city, and heed to be taken that there be nothing done contrary to this order,  
<span class="verse" id="E12_29">29 </span>and that those wicked doings proceed no further to the annoyance of kings.”  
<span class="verse" id="E12_30">30 </span>Then King Artaxerxes, his letters being read, Rathumus, and Samellius the scribe, and the rest of their associates, went in haste to Jerusalem with cavalry and a multitude of people in battle array, and began to hinder the builders. So the building of the temple in Jerusalem ceased until the second year of the reign of King Darius of the Persians.    </div>
<div class="psalmlabel" id="E13_0"> 3</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="verse" id="E13_1">1 </span>Now King Darius made a great feast for all his subjects, for all who were born in his house, for all the princes of Media and of Persia,  
<span class="verse" id="E13_2">2 </span>and for all the local governors and captains and governors who were under him, from India to Ethiopia, in the one hundred twenty seven provinces.  
<span class="verse" id="E13_3">3 </span>They ate and drank, and when they were satisfied went home. Then King Darius went into his bedchamber slept, but awakened out of his sleep.   </div>
<div class="p">
<span class="verse" id="E13_4">4 </span>Then the three young men of the bodyguard, who guarded the king, spoke one to another:  
<span class="verse" id="E13_5">5 </span>“Let every one of us state what one thing is strongest. King Darius will give he whose statement seems wiser than the others great gifts and great honors in token of victory.  
<span class="verse" id="E13_6">6 </span>He shall be clothed in purple, drink from gold cups, sleep on a gold bed, and have a chariot with bridles of gold, a fine linen turban, and a chain around his neck.  
<span class="verse" id="E13_7">7 </span>He shall sit next to Darius because of his wisdom, and shall be called cousin of Darius.”   </div>
<div class="p">
<span class="verse" id="E13_8">8 </span>Then they each wrote his sentence, sealed them, and laid them under King Darius’ pillow,  
<span class="verse" id="E13_9">9 </span>and said, “When the king wakes up, someone will give him the writing. Whoever the king and the three princes of Persia judge that his sentence is the wisest, to him shall the victory be given, as it is written.”  
<span class="verse" id="E13_10">10 </span>The first wrote, “Wine is the strongest.”  
<span class="verse" id="E13_11">11 </span>The second wrote, “The king is strongest.”  
<span class="verse" id="E13_12">12 </span>The third wrote, “Women are strongest, but above all things Truth is the victor.”   </div>
<div class="p">
<span class="verse" id="E13_13">13 </span>Now when the king woke up, they took the writing and gave it to him, so he read it.  
<span class="verse" id="E13_14">14 </span>Sending out, he called all the princes of Persia and of Media, the local governors, the captains, the governors, and the chief officers  
<span class="verse" id="E13_15">15 </span>and sat himself down in the royal seat of judgment; and the writing was read before them.  
<span class="verse" id="E13_16">16 </span>He said, “Call the young men, and they shall explain their own sentences. So they were called and came in.  
<span class="verse" id="E13_17">17 </span>They said to them, “Explain what you have written.”  </div>
<div class="p">Then the first, who had spoken of the strength of wine, began  
<span class="verse" id="E13_18">18 </span>and said this: “O sirs, how exceedingly strong wine is! It causes all men who drink it to go astray.  
<span class="verse" id="E13_19">19 </span>It makes the mind of the king and of the fatherless child to be the same, likewise of the bondman and of the freeman, of the poor man and of the rich.  
<span class="verse" id="E13_20">20 </span>It also turns every thought into cheer and mirth, so that a man remembers neither sorrow nor debt.  
<span class="verse" id="E13_21">21 </span>It makes every heart rich, so that a man remembers neither king nor local governor. It makes people say things in large amounts.  
<span class="verse" id="E13_22">22 </span>When they are in their cups, they forget their love both to friends and kindred, and before long draw their swords.  
<span class="verse" id="E13_23">23 </span>But when they awake from their wine, they don’t remember what they have done.  
<span class="verse" id="E13_24">24 </span>O sirs, isn’t wine the strongest, seeing that it forces people to do this?” And when he had said this, he stopped speaking.    </div>
<div class="psalmlabel" id="E14_0"> 4</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="verse" id="E14_1">1 </span>Then the second, who had spoken of the strength of the king, began to say,  
<span class="verse" id="E14_2">2 </span>“O sirs, don’t men excel in strength who rule over the sea and land, and all things in them?  
<span class="verse" id="E14_3">3 </span>But yet the king is stronger. He is their lord and has dominion over them. In whatever he commands them, they obey him.  
<span class="verse" id="E14_4">4 </span>If he tells them to make war the one against the other, they do it. If he sends them out against the enemies, they go, and conquer mountains, walls, and towers.  
<span class="verse" id="E14_5">5 </span>They kill and are killed, and don’t disobey the king’s commandment. If they win the victory, they bring everything to the king—all the plunder and everything else.  
<span class="verse" id="E14_6">6 </span>Likewise for those who are not soldiers, and don’t have anything to do with wars, but farm, when they have reaped again that which they had sown, they bring some to the king and compel one another to pay tribute to the king.  
<span class="verse" id="E14_7">7 </span>He is just one man! If he commands people to kill, they kill. If he commands them to spare, they spare.  
<span class="verse" id="E14_8">8 </span>If he commands them to strike, they strike. If he commands them to make desolate, they make desolate. If he commands to build, they build.  
<span class="verse" id="E14_9">9 </span>If he commands them to cut down, they cut down. If he commands them to plant, they plant.  
<span class="verse" id="E14_10">10 </span>So all his people and his armies obey him. Furthermore, he lies down, he eats and drinks, and takes his rest;  
<span class="verse" id="E14_11">11 </span>and these keep watch around him. None of them may depart and do his own business. They don’t disobey him in anything.  
<span class="verse" id="E14_12">12 </span>O sirs, how could the king not be the strongest, seeing that he is obeyed like this?” Then he stopped talking.   </div>
<div class="p">
<span class="verse" id="E14_13">13 </span>Then the third, who had spoken of women, and of truth, (this was Zorobabel) began to speak:  
<span class="verse" id="E14_14">14 </span>“O sirs, isn’t the king great, and men are many, and isn’t wine strong? Who is it then who rules them, or has the lordship over them? Aren’t they women?  
<span class="verse" id="E14_15">15 </span>Women have given birth to the king and all the people who rule over sea and land.  
<span class="verse" id="E14_16">16 </span>They came from women. Women nourished up those who planted the vineyards, from where the wine comes.  
<span class="verse" id="E14_17">17 </span>Women also make garments for men. These bring glory to men. Without women, men can’t exist.  
<span class="verse" id="E14_18">18 </span>Yes, and if men have gathered together gold and silver and any other beautiful thing, and see a woman who is lovely in appearance and beauty,  
<span class="verse" id="E14_19">19 </span>they let all those things go and gape at her, and with open mouth stare at her. They all have more desire for her than for gold, or silver, or any other beautiful thing.  
<span class="verse" id="E14_20">20 </span>A man leaves his own father who brought him up, leaves his own country, and joins with his wife.  
<span class="verse" id="E14_21">21 </span>With his wife he ends his days, with no thought for his father, mother, or country.  
<span class="verse" id="E14_22">22 </span>By this also you must know that women have dominion over you. Don’t you labor and toil, and bring it all to give to women?  
<span class="verse" id="E14_23">23 </span>Yes, a man takes his sword and goes out to travel, to rob, to steal, and to sail on the sea and on rivers.  
<span class="verse" id="E14_24">24 </span>He sees a lion and walks in the darkness. When he has stolen, plundered, and robbed, he brings it to the woman he loves.  
<span class="verse" id="E14_25">25 </span>Therefore a man loves his wife better than father or mother.  
<span class="verse" id="E14_26">26 </span>Yes, there are many who have lost their minds for women, and become slaves for their sakes.  
<span class="verse" id="E14_27">27 </span>Many also have perished, have stumbled, and sinned, for women.  
<span class="verse" id="E14_28">28 </span>Now don’t you believe me? Isn’t the king great in his power? Don’t all regions fear to touch him?  
<span class="verse" id="E14_29">29 </span>Yet I saw him and Apame the king’s concubine, the daughter of the illustrious Barticus, sitting at the right hand of the king,  
<span class="verse" id="E14_30">30 </span>and taking the crown from the king’s head, and setting it upon her own head. Yes, she struck the king with her left hand.  
<span class="verse" id="E14_31">31 </span>At this, the king gaped and gazed at her with open mouth. If she smiles at him, he laughs. But if she takes any displeasure at him, he flatters her, that she might be reconciled to him again.  
<span class="verse" id="E14_32">32 </span>O sirs, how can it not be that women are strong, seeing they do this?”   </div>
<div class="p">
<span class="verse" id="E14_33">33 </span>Then the king and the nobles looked at one another. So he began to speak concerning truth.  
<span class="verse" id="E14_34">34 </span>“O sirs, aren’t women strong? The earth is great. The sky is high. The sun is swift in its course, for it circles around the sky, and returns on its course again in one day.  
<span class="verse" id="E14_35">35 </span>Isn’t he who makes these things great? Therefore the truth is great, and stronger than all things.  
<span class="verse" id="E14_36">36 </span>All the earth calls upon truth, and the sky blesses truth. All works shake and tremble, but with truth there is no unrighteous thing.  
<span class="verse" id="E14_37">37 </span>Wine is unrighteous. The king is unrighteous. Women are unrighteous. All the children of men are unrighteous, and all their works are unrighteous. There is no truth in them. They shall also perish in their unrighteousness.  
<span class="verse" id="E14_38">38 </span>But truth remains, and is strong forever. Truth lives and conquers forevermore.  
<span class="verse" id="E14_39">39 </span>With truth there is no partiality toward persons or rewards, but truth does the things that are just, instead of any unrighteous or wicked things. All men approve truth’s works.  
<span class="verse" id="E14_40">40 </span>In truth’s judgment is not any unrighteousness. Truth is the strength, the kingdom, the power, and the majesty of all ages. Blessed be the God of truth!”   </div>
<div class="p">
<span class="verse" id="E14_41">41 </span>With that, he stopped speaking. Then all the people shouted and said, “Great is truth, and strong above all things!”   </div>
<div class="p">
<span class="verse" id="E14_42">42 </span>Then the king said to him, “Ask what you wish, even more than is appointed in writing, and we will give it to you, because you are found wisest. You shall sit next me, and shall be called my cousin.”   </div>
<div class="p">
<span class="verse" id="E14_43">43 </span>Then he said to the king, “Remember your vow, which you vowed to build Jerusalem, in the day when you came to your kingdom,  
<span class="verse" id="E14_44">44 </span>and to send back all the vessels that were taken out of Jerusalem, which Cyrus set apart when he vowed to destroy Babylon, and vowed to send them back there.  
<span class="verse" id="E14_45">45 </span>You also vowed to build the temple which the Edomites burned when Judea was made desolate by the Chaldeans.  
<span class="verse" id="E14_46">46 </span>Now, O lord the king, this is what I request, and what I desire of you, and this is the princely generosity that may proceed from you: I ask therefore that you make good the vow, the performance of which you have vowed to the King of Heaven with your own mouth.”   </div>
<div class="p">
<span class="verse" id="E14_47">47 </span>Then King Darius stood up, kissed him, and wrote letters for him to all the treasurers and governors and captains and local governors, that they should safely bring on their way both him, and all those who would go up with him to build Jerusalem.  
<span class="verse" id="E14_48">48 </span>He wrote letters also to all the governors who were in Coelesyria and Phoenicia, and to them in Libanus, that they should bring cedar wood from Libanus to Jerusalem, and that they should help him build the city.  
<span class="verse" id="E14_49">49 </span>Moreover he wrote for all the Jews who would go out of his realm up into Judea concerning their freedom, that no officer, no governor, no local governor, nor treasurer, should forcibly enter into their doors,  
<span class="verse" id="E14_50">50 </span>and that all the country which they occupied should be free to them without tribute, and that the Edomites should give up the villages of the Jews which they held at that time,  
<span class="verse" id="E14_51">51 </span>and that there should be given twenty talents yearly toward the building of the temple, until the time that it was built,  
<span class="verse" id="E14_52">52 </span>and another ten talents yearly for burnt offerings to be presented upon the altar every day, as they had a commandment to make seventeen offerings,  
<span class="verse" id="E14_53">53 </span>and that all those who would come from Babylonia to build the city should have their freedom—they and their descendants, and all the priests that came.  
<span class="verse" id="E14_54">54 </span>He wrote also to give them their support and the priests’ vestments in which they minister.  
<span class="verse" id="E14_55">55 </span>For the Levites he wrote that their support should be given them until the day that the house was finished and Jerusalem built up.  
<span class="verse" id="E14_56">56 </span>He commanded that land and wages should be given to all who guarded the city.  
<span class="verse" id="E14_57">57 </span>He also sent away all the vessels from Babylon that Cyrus had set apart, and all that Cyrus had given in commandment, he commanded also to be done and to be sent to Jerusalem.   </div>
<div class="p">
<span class="verse" id="E14_58">58 </span>Now when this young man had gone out, he lifted up his face to heaven toward Jerusalem, and praised the King of heaven,

<span class="verse" id="E14_61">61 </span>So he took the letters, went out, came to Babylon, and told it all his kindred.  
<span class="verse" id="E14_62">62 </span>They praised the God of their ancestors, because he had given them freedom and liberty

<span class="verse" id="E18_53">53 </span>Again we prayed to our lord about these things, and found him to be merciful.   </div>
<div class="p">
<span class="verse" id="E18_54">54 </span>Then I set apart twelve men of the chiefs of the priests,<a class="noteref" epub:type="noteref" href="#FN132">†</a> Eserebias, Assamias, and ten men of their kindred with them.  
<span class="verse" id="E18_55">55 </span>I weighed out to them the silver, the gold, and the holy vessels of the house of our Lord, which the king, his counselors, the nobles, and all Israel had given.  
<span class="verse" id="E18_56">56 </span>When I had weighed it, I delivered to them six hundred fifty talents of silver, silver vessels weighing one hundred talents, one hundred talents of gold,

<span class="verse" id="E18_58">58 </span>I said to them, “You are holy to the Lord, the vessels are holy, and the gold and the silver are a vow to the Lord, the Lord of our fathers.

<span class="verse" id="E18_60">60 </span>So the priests and the Levites who received the silver, the gold, and the vessels which were in Jerusalem, brought them into the temple of the Lord.   </div>

<span class="verse" id="E18_64">64 </span>All the weight of them was recorded at the same hour.  
<span class="verse" id="E18_65">65 </span>Moreover those who had come out of captivity offered sacrifices to the Lord, the God of Israel, even twelve bulls for all Israel, ninety-six rams,

<span class="verse" id="E18_70">70 </span>For both they and their sons have married with their daughters, and the holy seed is mixed with the foreign people of the land. From the beginning of this matter the rulers and the nobles have been partakers of this iniquity.”   </div>
<div class="p">
<span class="verse" id="E18_71">71 </span>And as soon as I had heard these things, I tore my clothes and my holy garment, and plucked the hair from off my head and beard, and sat down sad and full of heaviness.

<span class="verse" id="E18_73">73 </span>Then rising up from the fast with my clothes and my holy garment torn, and bowing my knees and stretching out my hands to the Lord,  
<span class="verse" id="E18_74">74 </span>I said, “O Lord, I am ashamed and confounded before your face,

<div class="p">
<span class="verse" id="E18_82">82 </span>“Now, O Lord, what shall we say, having these things? For we have transgressed your commandments which you gave by the hand of your servants the prophets, saying,

<span class="verse" id="E18_92">92 </span>Then Jechonias the son of Jeelus, one of the sons of Israel, called out, and said, “O Esdras, we have sinned against the Lord God, we have married foreign women of the heathen of the land, but there is still hope for Israel.  
<span class="verse" id="E18_93">93 </span>Let’s make an oath to the Lord about this, that we will put away all our foreign wives with their children,
