# A Non-Aligned Common Front: Strategic Imaginaries of the New International Economic Order 


> **Abstract**
>
> Fifty years after the Sixth Special Session, the Progressive
International has declared a strategy of \'rebuilding the Non-Aligned
movement\', and \'renovating the NIEO\'. However, key questions remain
about the praxis of the original. The draft declarations of the
programme of action and declaration on the establishment of a NIEO were
brought to the UN by the leaders of 95 states, caucused as the G77.
There proposals and strategies, therefore, were inherently plural. This
begs the question of how such a \'common front\' had even been possible.
This article offers a partial answer by exploring the strategic
imaginaries that underlined the project. It first establishes that the
Leninist ideas of Kwame Nkrumah and the liberal ideas of Raúl Prebisch
converged at the level of world order. Then, by drawing on the work of
Mohammed Bedjaoui, it shows that these contradictory tendencies were
successfully synthesised in practice.

What would a successful NIEO have looked like? Clearly, this can\'t be
known, because the core proposals of the NIEO were never tested in
practice. Still, as C.L.R. James showed in *The* *Black Jacobins*,
imaginary \'what if?\' scenarios are foundational to all strategic
decision making. To decide how to act, people imagine *what would happen
if* each option was taken. To understand the strategic decision making
of the NIEO, then, is to consider the project\'s strategic imaginaries.
How did G77 elites imagine a successful NIEO? A full answer to this
question is beyond the scope of this article. Here, I consider the
strategies of the NIEO more broadly, by focusing on on its intellectual
foundations. **The Declaration and Programme of Action** drew on two
distinct, but intertwined, praxes: Kwame Nkrumah\'s critique of
neo-colonialism and Raúl Prebisch\'s work on the declining terms of
trade. These organic intellectuals agreed on the need for liberal
reforms to world order. However, they did so for entirely different
reasons. Whereas Nkrumah imagined NIEO-style reforms as useful for
global socialism, Prebisch sought a global capitalism that worked as its
neo-classical boosters already believed it did. This strategic pluralism
allowed the G77 to forge global agreement amongst ideologically diverse
state elites. In this sense, the NIEO was a truly Non-Aligned \'common
front\'.[^1]

Understanding the strategic imaginaries of the original campaign is
essential for understanding the project\'s decision making. This, in
turn, is essential for the Progressive International\'s current goal of
\'renovating the NIEO\'.[^2] Unfortunately, the G77\'s decision making
has been systematically ignored by those disciplines best placed to
study it. As John Hobson and Alina Sajed have shown, both Orthodox and
Critical theories of International Relations are founded on Eurocentric
conceptions of non-Western agency.[^3] This is evident in the work of
two theorists who closely studied the NIEO in the 1970s. Then, both John
G. Ruggie and Robert W. Cox believed that a New International Economic
Order might be immanent.[^4] However, as soon as they realised that the
project had failed, they assumed that it had always been powerless.[^5]
For Cox, this dissmissal was based on an overt counterfactual-phobia.
Like the great E.H. Carr, Cox dismissed counterfactuals as the stuff of
idealism.[^6] The implication was that there was no need to consider the
strategic decision making of G77 elites. Their initial failure was
enough to conclude that the NIEO had never stood a chance of succeeding,
and this was enough to conclude that the NIEO was irrelevant to any
historical materialist theory of world order.

An exception to this counterfactual-phobia came from the political
economy of Samir Amin. In 1982, Amin wrote *After the NIEO*, a radical
critique of the praxis of the G77, which he had opposed throughout the
1970s. Despite his opposition, Amin posed the key historical questions
of G77 decision making, or agency. He asked why the project failed, and
questioned whether it had been inevitable. Fifty years after the Sixth
Special Session, similar questions are being asked by the Progressive
International. Yanis Varoufakis, for example, called on the
International to ask itself: \'**why did we fail the last time
round?\'** To answer this, and to \'renovate the NIEO\', the
International must reckon with Amin\'s critique, including his Leninist
counterfactual. That is the task of this article. After exploring
Amin\'s strategic imaginary of the NIEO, I compare it to those that
guided the project. These included the Leninism of Kwame Nkrumah and the
liberalism of Raúl Prebisch. Then, I consider the strategic imaginary of
the Algerian jurist, and active participant in the original NIEO
campaign, Mohammed Bedjaoui. His work is evidence, I argue, that the
contradictory visions of what a NIEO would achieve were successfully
synthesised in practice.

**Samir Amin\'s Leninist Rejection of the NIEO\'s Praxis**

In 1981, US banks ---- in league with the IMF ---- exported the first
financial crisis of the then-nascent neoliberal world disorder onto the
worlds poorest people. While witnessing this latest example of
imperialist savagery, Samir Amin posed fundamental historical questions
of the praxis of the original NIEO campaign. He considered whether \'the
factors behind the clearly visible failure\' were \'purely contingent\'
aspects of the economic crisis, or \'traceable to the \"tactical
errors\" of the Third World\'.[^7] His answer drew on a Leninist theory
of imperialism as monopoly capitalism. Whereas advocates described the
G77 as a group of \'proletarian nations\', or a \'trade union of the
poor\', Amin assessed G77 states according to their ruling classes.[^8]
To him, the G77 was a group of \'peripheral capitalist states and their
bourgeoisies\' who were opposed by \'the monopolies and the imperialist
states\'.[^9] Despite this tension, the NIEO had not sought to overthrow
the fundamental economic basis of imperialism: monopoly capitalism.
Instead, Amin wrote that its \'programme permits an increase in the rate
of profit on a world scale and can only be read therefore, as a
contribution to global capitalist development.\'[^10] In the end, \'the
monopolies and the imperialist states\' won, something Amin observed in
the so-called Third World Debt Crisis. This \'resurgence of finance
capital\' saw the IMF collude with US banks to install a \'tutellage
regime reminiscent of the protectorates established in the 19th Century
in the East and Latin America\'.

By framing the emergence of the NIEO as a breakdown in the
inter-imperial bargain of Bretton Woods, and its defeat as the result of
a resurgent global finance, Amin was relying on a consistent Leninist
theory of imperialism.[^11] For Lenin, imperialism was not simply a form
of domination, but a historical era, the final stage of capitalism.[^12]
This followed *an age of freely competitive capitalism*, a period when
liberal economic theory more closely approximated international trade,
and when industrialisation was more easily replicated by competing
national economies.[^13] For Lenin, this stage \'reached its limit in
the 1860s and 1870s\'. Following this, the concentration and scale of
capitalist production became so great that industrialisation could no
longer be easily replicated. The implication is that industrialisation
in the periphery is far more difficult than it had been under the age of
freely competitive capitalism. Peripheral industrialisation is an uphill
struggle against the imperial core, which actively seeks its
underdevelopment. This is why Amin presents the G77 as \'peripheral
capitalist states and their bourgeoisies\' and the global North as \'the
monopolies and imperialist states\'.

Seen in this light, Amin saw the NIEO as part of the ongoing process of
inter-imperial bargaining that is inherent to monopoly capitalism. It
was a strategy of strengthening \'the Third World against the centres of
the system through a common front\'. For Amin, the failure of this
strategy exposed the impossibilities of resisting imperialism on a
pro-capitalist basis. To make this claim, Amin pointed to internal
divisions, and the problem of \'sub-imperialism\', which had plagued the
G77.[^14] As it turned out, the NIEO campaign allowed the relatively
stronger partners \'to occupy a short term favourable position in the
International Division of Labour even at the expense of the
others.\'[^15] This cemented Amin\'s theory that economic development
within the global capitalist system was especially impossible for \'the
\"less advanced\" countries for whom even dependent development is a
mirage.\'[^16] As such, the NIEO was not just a failed strategy. For
Amin, it was a dangerous distraction.[^17] The G77 had resisted monopoly
capitalism, but only from a petit-bourgeois basis, and only with
petit-bourgeois demands. As such, it had been destined to fail. The task
of peripheral industrialisation could only succeed, Amin argued, by
promoting grass roots social forces, those same social forces that had
created the global wave of decolonisation.[^18]

In articulating this damning dismissal of the NIEO\'s praxis, Amin
relied on a Leninist counterfactual. He considered what it would mean if
the NIEO Project could succeed in \'transforming this dependency
relationship and compelling the adjustment of the world system\':

> \'If that should turn out to be the case one should be able to look
> back on imperialism as merely a stage - an intermediate stage - in the
> expansion of capitalism on a world scale and not as the highest stage
> of capitalism; it would have proved, that is, as the stage that
> ushered in the transition from a system characterised by the
> asymetrical centre-periphery relationships that define it to a
> homogeneous global system dominated by capitalist relations.\'[^19]

As I show below, this was precisely the vision of Raúl Prebisch: not to
overthrow global capitalism but to revive it. However, the NIEO had not
only drawn on the liberalism of Raúl Prebisch. It also drew on the
Leninist political economy of Kwame Nkrumah, who imagined an entirely
different future for NIEO-style reforms.

**The Strategic Imaginary of Kwame Nkrumah**

Nkrumah agreed with Amin that imperialism was the final stage of
capitalism. His classic work on neo-colonialism hadn\'t revised Lenin\'s
theory, but applied it to the post-WWII world disorder. Nkrumah made
this point explicitly, arguing that:

> [']{dir="rtl"}Colonialism has achieved a new guise. It has become
> neo-colonialism, the last stage of imperialism; its final bid for
> existence, as monopoly-capitalism or imperialism is the last stage of
> capitalism.[']{dir="rtl"}[^20]

Like Amin, then, Nkrumah understood the task of economic development in
the periphery as a struggle against global finance.[^21] Indeed, Nkrumah
saw neo-colonialism as \'the empire of finance capital, in fact if not
in name, a vast sprawling network of intercontinental activity on a
highly diversified scale that controls the lives of millions of people
in the most widely separated parts of the world\'.[^22] Unlike Amin,
Nkrumah took a pragmatic approach to this empire, arguing that \'it is
impossible for any of us to avoid dealing with monopoly in some form or
another.\'[^23] For Nkrumah the question was not whether to deal with
monopolies, but how. With international solidarity, Non-Aligned state
elites could \'maintain the integrity of our financial institutions\'
and \'leave ourselves room to manoeuvre away\' from
neo-colonialism.[^24] So whereas Amin advocated for state-led autarkic
development, Nkrumah advocated for regional and global collaboration to
mitigate the worst effects of imperialism. Here, his focus was on
pan-African socialism, but he also supported \'a strengthening of the
Afro-Asian Solidarity Organisation and the spirit of Bandung\', as well
as solidarity \'on an increasingly formal basis\' with \'our Latin
American brothers.\'[^25] Thus, whereas Amin criticised the NIEO\'s
\'common front\' strategy, Nkrumah helped create it. He argued that
newly-independent states must act \'in a combination that will give
strength to our bargaining power and eliminate so many of the
duplications that give greater force and greater advantage to the
imperialists and their strategy of neo-colonialism.\'[^26]

In calling for international solidarity, Nkrumah imagined global reforms
that would become key pillars of the campaign for a New International
Economic Order. These included calls for aid to be distributed by
multilateral organisations operating democratically, a \'continental
code to govern foreign investment\', and support for increased free
trade.[^27] Nkrumah didn\'t believe these reforms would succeed in
isolation, but thought they would be useful. By mitigating the worst
effects of imperialism, these proposals would boost economic development
in the periphery, and heighten the contradiction between capital and
labour in the imperial core.[^28] Thus, despite what Amin might consider
Nkrumah\'s \"imperialist reformism\", this was pure Lenin. For Lenin had
argued that monopolistic superprofits allowed imperialists to \'bribe
the labour leaders and the upper stratum of the labour
aristocracy.\'[^29] Nkrumah built on this directly, reasoning that any
mitigation of such superprofits would heighten class conflict in the
core:

> \'When Africa becomes economically free and politically united, the
> monopolists will come face to face with their own working class in
> their own countries, and a new struggle will arise within which the
> liquidation and collapse of imperialism will be complete.\'[^30]

This is a wildly different Leninism to Samir Amin. For Amin, NIEO-style
reform was a dangerous distraction. In Nkrumah\'s imaginary, NIEO-style
reforms were strategically useful. They would assist with economic
development in the periphery while heightening class contradictions in
the imperial core.

**Raúl Prebisch\'s Liberal Anti-Imperialism**

As the founding Secretary General of the United Nations Conference on
Trade and Development, Raúl Prebisch coined the idea of a \'new
international order\', and theorised the foundations of the NIEO\'s
political economy. At the level of world order, Prebisch\'s work
overlapped with Nrkumah\'s. Both agreed that global capitalism was not
functioning as it had in the 19th century, and both believed that these
structural constraints could be mitigated by liberal reforms. This
overlap allowed their ideas to be synthesised in the founding
declarations of the NIEO. However, beneath the surface of this \'common
front\' were two distinct strategic imaginaries. Nkrumah wanted to
transcend capitalism. Prebisch wanted to fix it with a more rational
form of global economic management.[^31] As such, he believed NIEO-style
reforms would benefit development in the core just as much as in the
periphery.

Just like Lenin, Nkrumah and Amin, Prebisch appreciated that the history
of colonisation had changed the structure and function of global
capitalism. He published this historical sociology in a founding UNCTAD
document, *Towards a New Trade Policy For Development*. Her argued that
in the 19th century, the United Kingdom had \'applied no protectionist
tariffs\'. In this \'propitious international setting\',
industrialisation in the core could \'turn outwards\', and reap \'the
benefits of specialisation and of an adequate scale of
production.\'[^32] The opposite is true for industrialisation following
the Great Depression. Then, elites in the United States and the United
Kingdom erected protectionist barriers, which forced industrialisation
in the periphery to take place in a closed and hostile world economy.
For Prebisch, this forced these states to rely on the necessary evil of
import-substitution.[^33] In Latin America a wave of industrialisation
followed, but it pushed into limits that hadn\'t existed in the 19th
century. Whereas Europe and Japan benefited from large, global export
markets, Latin American industrialisation \'proceeded piecemeal in a
large number of watertight compartments with little inter-communication,
to the serious detriment of productivity.\'[^34]

Prebisch appreciated that this context of restricted and declining world
trade was mitigated by the establishment of the Bretton Woods
institutions, especially the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
(GATT). Still, he criticised its assumption that \'the free play of
international economic forces by itself leads to the optimum expansion
of trade and the most efficient utilization of the world\'s productive
resources.\'[^35] Whereas the \'free play concept is admissible in
relations between countries that are structurally similar\', Prebisch
argued that it didn\'t apply between \'the industrially advanced and the
developing countries.\'[^36] For as Prebisch famously showed alongside
Hans Singer, the commodity exports from the periphery showed a long term
tendency to decline relative to industrial imports from the core.[^37]
This was a direct result of the history of colonisation, which had
conditioned the economies of the periphery to serve the interests of the
core. For Prebisch, this meant that despite the best intentions of the
GATT, its principles perpetuated economic dependency. By demanding that
an unequal world lower trade barriers equally, the Bretton Woods system
was hindering, rather than helping, economic development.[^38]

This historical critique was used to devise practical measures to boost
global trade and development. The goal was to mitigate the structural
forces making peripheral industrialisation harder than it had been in
the 19th century. This would require a real transfer of wealth from the
core to the periphery; the establishment of commodity agreements to
regulate and increase the price of peripheral exports; and a general
system of preferences. Here, tariffs would be lowered on exports from
the periphery, as a means of encouraging exports, particularly for
processed, or more highly value-added goods.[^39] However, Prebisch
never believed that these measures would be sufficient. He made this
point with a counterfactual, arguing that:

> \'If the peripheral countries manage to secure a larger share for
> their primary exports in the consumption of the industrial countries,
> this, together with the transfer of income from the latter countries
> to the former to offset the effects of the deterioration in the terms
> of trade, will help to narrow the trade gap but will not in itself be
> enough to close it. These measures will be palliatives, and the relief
> they afford, though considerable in some cases, will be of limited
> scope owing to the size of the gap. Hence, the absolute necessity of
> building up trade in industrial exports.\'[^40]

Just like Nkrumah, then, Prebisch saw NIEO-style reforms as
complimentary to the crucial task of industrialisation. Also like
Nkrumah, Prebisch believed that this would require regional cooperation.
In isolation, he reasoned, most peripheral states lacked the scale
needed for competitive export industries. As an alternative, Prebisch
advocated the collective promotion of infant industries on a regional,
and global, scale.[^41] As Prebisch was well aware, it was \'not a
matter of controversy among economists that national protection of
infant industries is justifiable wherever such industries have a
long-run prospect of reaching a high level of efficiency.\'[^42] This
efficiency required access to wider markets, both in the core and
periphery. As such, Prebisch made two core proposals:

> \'(a) developing countries should give preference to imports from
> other developing countries in their own markets; (b) developed
> countries should give preference to imports from developing countries
> in their own markets.\'[^43]

For Prebisch\'s neo-classical critics, this vision was a protectionist
nightmare. Anticipating this, he stressed that they did \'not have to be
a permanent phenomenon.\'[^44] The entire purpose, in fact, was to
create a world capitalist system in which no such interventions were
needed. As peripheral exports grew, the \'disparity\' with the core
\'can be levelled out gradually.\'[^45]

Here lay the biggest difference between Prebisch and Nkrumah. Despite
agreeing on the need for liberal reforms to world trade, they did so for
entirely different reasons. Nkrumah saw NIEO-style policies as useful
for creating global socialism. Prebisch saw them as paving the way for a
world capitalist system that worked as its neo-classical boosters
already believed it did. Thus, he wrote that:

> *\'With an effort of the imagination it is possible to visualize a
> situation of dynamic equilibrium in the distant future in which the
> trend in question disappears as a result of the world-wide process of
> industrialization.\'*[^46]

Here lay the NIEO\'s essentially capitalist vision, that which was
dismissed by Samir Amin. Prebisch appreciated that the history of
colonisation had distorted international trade, such that comparative
advantage didn\'t function properly between the core and periphery.
However, he didn\'t want to transcend but to fix this. In doing so,
Prebisch imagined NIEO-style reforms as benefitting the core just as
much as the periphery.[^47] This couldn\'t have been more different to
Nrkumah\'s vision, which assumed that any reduction in imperialist
superprofits would heighten contradictions in the core.

**Bedjaoui: The Strategic Imaginaries in Practice**

Despite their clear differences, the strategic imaginaries of Nkrumah
and Prebisch were synthesised in the founding declarations of the New
International Economic Order. Echoing Nkrumah, the NIEO called for
multilateral disbursement of foreign aid, a code of conduct to regulate
global monopolies, and the overthrow of neo-colonialism. Echoing
Prebisch, the NIEO called for the regulation of commodity markets, trade
preferences, and real compensation for the declining terms of trade.
This \'common front\', as Amin described it, was essential for the
solidarity of the G77. It allowed capitalist and socialist state elites
to find common ground. Nevertheless, this compromise masked fundamental
strategic differences. As Nkrumah imagined it, NIEO-style reforms would
damage the interests of imperialists. If true, then the G77\'s goal of
reaching a global consensus in the UN General Assembly was unrealistic.
It would be better for Non-Aligned state elites to act independently.
For Prebisch, NIEO-style reforms were imagined as a more rational form
of economic management. If true, a global consensus could be reached and
it would benefit all. In practice, both tendencies were fused in a
changing and contradictory synthesis. Each G77 leader, and each
diplomat, had to strike a balance between these two imaginaries. This
was an essential part of their decision making. An example of this
synthesis can be found in the pioneering work of the Algerian jurist,
and active participant in the NIEO, Mohammed Bedjaoui.

Bedjaoui embraced the NIEO\'s contradictory synthesis, and grappled with
its strategic tensions. Indeed, the stated gaol of **his book** was \'to
make a rapid diagnosis of the present economic order and add a forecast
of what it will be or might become, after weighing up the contradictory
demands of the various groups of protagonists in the world and
identifying the balance of power between them as expressed by their
antagonistic relations.\'[^48] For Bedjaoui, this meant understanding
the contradictory possibilities of international law itself. Like
Nkrumah, he saw international law as a creation, and perpetuator, of
colonisation. However, he argued that it could be changed by
decolonisation.[^49] \'On this basis\', he believed it \'should be
possible, firstly, to determine the impact of these world-wide economic
demands on the future of international law\', and \'to draw up a
[']{dir="rtl"}legal strategy[']{dir="rtl"} for seeking ways and means by
which international law could in turn contribute to the establishment of
this new international economic order.[']{dir="rtl"}[^50] In doing so,
Bedjaoui relied on an eclectic mix of the intellectuals discussed in
this article. He drew on Prebisch\'s theory of the declining terms of
trade, a Nkrumahist theory of neo-colonialism, and Amin\'s work on
dependency and underdevelopment.[^51]

The result does not always seem consistent. At one time Bedjaoui sides
with Prebisch by concluding that a New International Economic Order
would be beneficial to both the core and periphery.[^52] At another he
sides with Nkrumah, arguing that a NIEO would necessarily damage the
interests of the core.[^53] These conflicting conclusions reflect the
long view of Bedjaoui\'s strategic imaginary, which included three
phases \'in the contradictory relationship which has grown up between
imperialism and the new order\':

> \'In the first phase, imperialism is still strong enough to wage war
> against the still hesitant idea of establishing a new international
> order. In the second phase, imperialism comes to terms with the new
> order when it realizes either that disorder is too prejudicial to its
> own interests or that it may [']{dir="rtl"}co-opt[']{dir="rtl"} the
> new order and exploit it to its own advantage. In the third stage,
> imperialism loses out to the victorious new order, and a new
> structural revolution triumphs over the old structures.\'[^54]

By the \'second stage\', a co-opted NIEO would be in in the interests of
the core. By the \'third stage\' the core and periphery would not longer
exist. Until then, Bedjaoui imagined the G77 as \'a trade union of the
poor\' struggling against the contradictions of the first phase.

The immediate task, he argued, lay in enshrining the principle of
states\' \'permanent rights over their natural resources\'.[^55] This
was essential for tackling the core problem of neo-colonialism, the fact
that postcolonial states had gained political but not economic
sovereignty.[^56] It also reflected the new balance of forces in the
1970s. By quadrupling the price of oil, OPEC implemented its right to
permanent sovereignty of its natural resources in practice. In doing so,
OPEC elites acted in accordance with Nkrumah\'s vision, whereby the
solidarity of postcolonial states could challenge global monopolies, and
heighten contradictions within the imperial core. Under Algerian
leadership, the NAM leveraged OPEC\'s new source of power ---- its
control of strategic pools of global finance ---- to call for the Sixth
Special Session.[^57] There, the G77 sought to legitimise OPEC\'s
actions via the global consensus of the UN General Assembly. This tactic
of building global consensus reflected the Prebischian belief that
NIEO-style reforms would be beneficial to all. Thus, the NIEO\'s two
strategic imaginaries were synthesised in practice, just as they were in
theory.

This contradictory synthesis was appreciated in Bedjaoui\'s critical
support of the NIEO project. He viewed the project\'s legal strategy as
a success because it had ---- for the first time ---- created a
foundational contradiction within international law. The founding
documents of the Sixth Special Session, passed by a global majority,
meant that the \'right\' of international law no longer correspond to
the \'might\' of the global minority.[^58] Still, Bedjaoui was critical
of how the G77 came to side with the more Prebischian goal of building
global consensus. To show this, he compared the declarations of the
Sixth Special Session to the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of
States. The founding documents of the NIEO declared the principle of
permanent sovereignty over natural resources without any qualification.
Only **one year later**, in an attempt at reaching consensus, the G77
made key concessions. For Bedjaoui, this compromise was a mistake. The
imperialists continued to deny the G77 a consensus position, but the G77
had now qualified the principle of permanent sovereignty, conceding that
states might have to pay compensation. In reflecting on this decision
making, Bedjaoui claimed that all faith in global consensus building was
over.[^59]

Varoufakis**

[^13]: [']{dir="rtl"}Thus, the principal stages in the history of
    monopolies are the following: (1) 1860-70, the highest stage, the
    apex of development of free competition; monopoly is in the barely
    discernible, embryonic stage. (2) After the crisis of 1873, a
    lengthy period of development of cartels; but they are still the
    exception. They are not yet durable. They are still a transitory
    phenomenon. (3) The boom at the end of the nineteenth century and
    the crisis of 1900-03. Cartels become one of the foundations of the
    whole of economic life. Capitalism has been transformed into
    imperialism.[']{dir="rtl"}

    \...

    [']{dir="rtl"}Half a century ago, when Marx was writing Capital,
    free competition appeared to the overwhelming majority of economists
    to be a ["]{dir="rtl"}natural law". Official science tried, by a
    conspiracy of silence, to kill the works of Marx, who by a
    theoretical and historical analysis of capitalism had proved that
    free competition gives rise to the concentration of production,
    which, in turn, at a certain stage of development, leads to
    monopoly. Today, monopoly has become a fact. Economists are writing
    mountains of books in which they describe the diverse manifestations
    of monopoly, and continue to declare in chorus that
    ["]{dir="rtl"}Marxism is refuted." But facts are stubborn things, as
    the English proverb says, and they have to be reckoned with, whether
    we like it or not. The facts show that differences between
    capitalist countries, e.g., in the matter of protection or free
    trade, only give rise to insignificant variations in the form of
    monopolies or in the moment of their appearance; and that the rise
    of monopolies, as the result of the concentration of production, is
    a general and fundamental law of the present stage of development of
    capitalism.[']{dir="rtl"}

    \...

    \'[']{dir="rtl"}Competition becomes transformed into monopoly. The
    result is immense progress in the socialisation of production. In
    particular, the process of technical invention and improvement
    becomes socialised.

    This is something quite different from the old free competition
    between manufacturers, scattered and out of touch with one another,
    and producing for an unknown market. Concentration has reached the
    point at which it is possible to make an approximate estimate of all
    sources of raw materials (for example, the iron ore deposits) of a
    country and even, as we shall see, of several countries, or of the
    whole world. Not only are such estimates made, but these sources are
    captured by gigantic monopolist associations. An approximate
    estimate of the capacity of markets is also made, and the
    associations ["]{dir="rtl"}divide" them up amongst themselves by
    agreement. Skilled labour is monopolised, the best engineers are
    engaged; the means of transport are captured---railways in America,
    shipping companies in Europe and America. Capitalism in its
    imperialist stage leads directly to the most comprehensive
    socialisation of production; it, so to speak, drags the capitalists,
    against their will and consciousness, into some sort of a new social
    order, a transitional one from complete free competition to complete
    socialisation.

    Production becomes social, but appropriation remains private. The
    social means of production remain the private property of a few. The
    general framework of formally recognised free competition remains,
    and the yoke of a few monopolists on the rest of the population
    becomes a hundred times heavier, more burdensome and
    intolerable.[']{dir="rtl"}

    antagonisms it is to exploit them in furtherance of the strategies
    of established emergent dependent bourgeoises aspiring to improve
    their position on the world system at the expense of the weak. Nor
    is the recourse to external powers a pure accident, for the
    intervention of these powers is needed to make up for the weaknesses
    of a strategy which cannot but be weak because it is not rooted in
    the profound aspirations of the popular masses but can, at best,
    only associate them in the pursuit of limited objectives consistent
    with the path chosen by the exploiting classes. Each passing day
    carries with it more evidence that this strategy has the effect of

[^21]: In fact, the idea of neo-colonialism can be seen already in
    Lenin\'s work on imperialism:

    [']{dir="rtl"}Since we are speaking of colonial policy in the epoch
    of capitalist imperialism, it must be observed that finance capital
    and its foreign policy, which is the struggle of the great powers
    for the economic and political division of the world, give rise to a
    number of transitional forms of state dependence. Not only are the
    two main groups of countries, those owning colonies, and the
    colonies themselves, but also the diverse forms of dependent
    countries which, politically, are formally independent, but in fact,
    are enmeshed in the net of financial and diplomatic dependence,
    typical of this epoch. We have already referred to one form of
    dependence---the semi-colony. An example of another is provided by
    Argentina.\'

[^41]: \'The stress just laid on industrial exports does not mean that
    import substitution policy should be abandoned. On the contrary, it
    should be maintained. In calculating the potential trade gap, it was
    assumed that the tempo of the substitution process will remain the
    same as in the past. There is still a margin for import
    substitution, although it has shrunk considerably in those
    peripheral countries which have made more headway with
    industrialization. The margin could be appreciably widened if
    substitution were to be carried out, not within each individual
    country\'s domestic market, but within groupings of countries so as
    to reap more easily the benefits of competition, specialization and
    economies of scale.

    This more rational form of substitution policy could be applied to
    imports not only of goods but also of services, such as freight and
    insurance, which form an important component of the potential gap.
    Furthermore, in some cases the export of these services might be
    increased if a collective approach were to be adopted through such
    groupings. But the difficulties in the way are by no means
    negligible.

    forecast of what it will be or might become, after weighing up the
    contradictory demands of the various groups of protagonists in the
    world and identifying the balance of power between them as expressed
