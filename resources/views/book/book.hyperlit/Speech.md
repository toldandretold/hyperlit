In this talk I will survey some of the key counterfactuals — or imaginary “what if?” scenarios — that were foundational to the creation and leadership of the original NIEO project. That means surveying how several key intellectual and political leaders imagined NIEO style reforms. How, that is, did they answer the key question, of what would happen if NIEO-style reforms were successfully implemented.

## Why? ##

For some, counterfactuals should be ignored, for they are entirely imaginary. As such, they are considered only the stuff of fiction. 

This misses that imaginary “what if?” Scenarios are foundational to decision making.

When deciding to come to this presentation, we had to imagine the alternatives. Possible futures where we instead learned about other interesting topics, or perhaps futures where we simply sat outside, and had some quality alone time. How you imagined these futures affected your choice to attend this session.

It is in this sense that imaginary “what if?” scenarios are of fundamental historical significance. They are how consciousness creates its own history. 

The same is true for the strategic decision making that has shaped the history of world order and global development. 

When deciding to create the campaign for a NIEO, G77 elites imagined what would happen if they did, and what would happen if they didn’t. 

To get to the heart of these strategic imaginaries, then, is to search for the counterfactual logic they depend on.

I will not consider this in full historical detail. I will not, that is, consider the strategic decision making of each G77 elite. Instead, I focus on the counterfactuals used by the two political economists, and leaders, which the NIEO’s proposals drew most inspiration from. These were Kwame Nkrumah and Raul Prebisch. 

Before doing so, however, I begin with Samir Amin. Amin was not a proponent of the NIEO. He was a radical critic of it. His criticism is unique in that it did not ignore questions of G77 decision making, nor uncertain economic contingencies. What’s more, his critique has devastating implications for  those movements — like the Progressive International — that are presently seeking to revive the NAM and renovate the NIEO. For if Amin is correct, the NIEO was not just a weak strategy, it was a dangerous one.

### *After the NIEO* (1982) ###

Unlike other critics or dismissers of the NIEO, Amin did not ignore questions of the project's strategic decision making, nor of economic contingencies outside of the project's control. Indeed, writing in 1982, during the Third World Debt crisis, he was one of the first to pose such questions:

>"<ins>What are the factors behind the clearly visible failure? Are those factors purely contingent (the economic crisis)? Are they traceable to the "tactical errors" of the Third World (to its divisions and weaknesses, for example).</ins> Or do this crisis and these weaknesses reflect the impossibility of auto-centred self reliant development within the periphery of the contemporary capitalist system?
>
>No doubt, the present crisis, which we believe to be essentially a structural crisis in the international division of labour, is a persistent one, as witnessed by the failure of short-term (monetary) or neo-Keynesian "solutions". This crisis, which began in the mid-60's as a crisis in inter-imperialist relations following the collapse of the Bretton Woods arrangements has now reached beyond that particular framework to affect the very foundations of economic life and production systems.
>
>It is not possible to "foresee" how the crisis is going to evolve, pregnant as it is with contradictory possibilities. The various struggles triggered by the crisis can lead, in effect, to the break-up of the integrated international market - under the hegemony of the United States - which has been the feature of the world system over the last quarter century."" p. 436.






### On what was the NIEO, in relation to world capitalist system ###

>'The objectives of the NIEO constitute a coherent programme responsive to the aspirations of the states of Third World. The internal logic of the programme - raising the prices of raw resources exported by the Third World; a new push in export oriented industrialisation geared to developed country markets and based on cheap manpower and the abundance of natural resources; and the acceleration, at reduced cost to developing countries, of technological transfer - reflects the contradictory nature of the accumulation of capital on a world-scale. On the one hand, this programme can only be predicated on a deepening of the international division of labour: by increasing the rate of extractable surplus-value (through the superexploitation of labour in the periphery), the programme permits an increase in the rate of profit on a world scale and can only be read therefore, as a contribution to global capitalist development. On the other hand contradictions emerge within the accepted framework of capitalist development between the strategies of the monopolies and the imperialist states on the one hand and those of the peripheral capitalist states and their bourgeoises on the other.' p. 432.




>"Even when, as sometimes happens, recourse is made to old antagonisms it is to exploit them in furtherance of the strategies of established emergent dependent bourgeoises aspiring to improve their position on the world system at the expense of the weak. Nor is the recourse to external powers a pure accident, <ins>for the intervention of these powers is needed to make up for the weaknesses of a strategy which cannot but be weak because it is not rooted in the profound aspirations of the popular masses but can, at best, only associate them in the pursuit of limited objectives consistent with the path chosen by the exploiting classes. Each passing day carries with it more evidence that this strategy has the effect of turning the Third World into a fair game for the rival superpowers.</ins>
>
>When the "crisis" of the New International Economic Order is perceived within the context of the thrusts of the world system it reveals the two dimensional and contradictory nature of ongoing transformations, transformations which can be analysed as a stage in the development of capitalism on a world scale but also as its crisis stage and as a stage of "transition to socialism".
>...
>Nor is it any more of an accident that prior to the initiation and, subsequent betrayal of socialism, capitalist expansion proceeded through peripherisation. The challenge of national liberation thus remains very much on the agenda, even if the specific ties have naturally changed, as they have always done in the past. <ins>A new wave of popular struggles is thus to be expected, the rise of populism in the Third World being a pointer in that direction. Not for the first time the peoples of the Third World may well lead the processes of world transformation.</ins>' pp. 447-448.
