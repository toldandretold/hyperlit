<p>A Non-Aligned Common Front: Strategic Imaginaries of the New
International Economic Order (NIEO)</p>
<p>Fifty years after the Sixth Special Session, the Progressive
International (PI) has declared a strategy of "renovating the NIEO".
However, key questions remain about the decisions that created and led
the original campaign. The NIEO's draft declarations were brought to the
UN General Assembly by the leaders of 95 states, caucused as the G77.
Their solidarity was necessarily pluralistic, drawing on Marxist and
Liberal visions of what Adom Getachew called “post-imperial
worldmaking”. This raises the question of how this global "common front"
was possible, and what the PI might do differently this time. As a
partial explanation, I compare two of the project's strategic
imaginaries, showing that they were successfully synthesised in
practice. As this legacy inspires the PI's focus on the possibilities of
sovereign debt crises, the NIEO continues to play an important
historical role. It alludes to possible options, or alternative futures,
of world order and global development.1</p>

<p>This article is part of a Special Issue commemorating the fiftieth
anniversary of the campaign for a NIEO (UN 1974a; 1974b), but the
project's significance transcends the past. Right now, the Progressive
International (PI) is seeking to "Renew the Non-Aligned Movement" and
"Renovate the NIEO" (Havana Congress 2023). The original project
attempted to resolve an uncertain world economic crisis by reaching a
global consensus on the reformation of the post-WWII world order, or the
rules and institutions of global trade, finance and debt. For example,
the <em>Declaration on the Establishment of a NIEO</em> explained that:
"Since 1970, the world economy has experienced a series of grave crises
which have had severe repercussions, especially on the developing
countries because of their generally greater vulnerability to external
economic impulses." It also stated that it had been "impossible to
achieve an even and balanced development of the international community
under the existing international economic order" (UN 1974a). The passing
of the NIEO's founding declarations led to a wholesale reconsideration,
across the entire United Nations system, of the global architecture of
development. After the "assassination" of the NIEO Project by US
imperialist elites (Prashad 2007), these strategic debates were silenced
by a neo-colonial "common sense".[^2] For decades, Development Studies and
the development industry have largely assumed that "there is no
alternative" to neo-liberal globalisation (Berger and Weber 2014, 24-25,
81; Fisher 2009; Prashad 2007, 214-219). The PI's goal of renovating the
NIEO is a renewed attempt at creating precisely such alternatives.</p>
<p>Launched in May 2020, the PI is a movement of movements aiming to
unite progressive forces globally, and its NIEO campaign is based on a
sober assessment of the original. In calling to seize "the opportunity
of the present historical juncture", its <em>Havana Declaration On The
NIEO</em> notes that "the crisis of the existing world system can either
entrench inequalities or embolden the call to reclaim Southern
protagonism" (Havana Congress 2023). This is a lesson from the rise and
decline of the solidarity of the original NIEO campaign. Initially, when
the Non-Aligned Movement leveraged the new power of the Organization of
the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), "Southern protagonism" was
emboldened. However, this was eventually crushed during the so-called
Third World Debt Crisis. This presents the Progressive International
with the problem of understanding, as Yanis Varoufakis (2023) has asked:
"Why did we lose last time round?" Unfortunately, the academic
literature is still struggling to answer this question. Despite the
historical reconsideration of the NIEO that followed Vijay Prashad's
pioneering histories of "the Third World Project" (Gilman 2015, 2023;
Prashad 2007, 2014; Schwartz 2023), fundamental questions remain about
the NIEO's strategic decision making (Thornton 2022; Venzka 2018). This
article provides a partial, and broad-brush answer. By relying on the
method of C.L.R. James, I trace the counterfactuals –– or imaginary
"what if?" scenarios –– that animated two of the NIEO's dominant
strategic imaginaries. That is, the imaginary futures which were used to
devise and decide between the available options, or strategic choices. I
then show how these strategic imaginaries were synthesised, first
theoretically and then in practice. This is important, I argue, because
the same strategic imaginaries continue to inspire the efforts of the
Progressive International to revive the project. This proves, as Nils
Gilman (2023) has argued, that the NIEO is a "usable past". It offers
badly needed alternatives to world order and global development.</p>
<p>The question of strategic decision making</p>
<p>[^2]: fuck...</p>
<p>By the early 1980s, scholars began to realise that the core proposals
of the NIEO would not be implemented. Instead, G77 solidarity crumbled
amidst the so-called Third World Debt Crisis (Prashad 2007, 210). In
this climate, a strange consensus emerged amongst those who had once
viewed it as either a serious threat or opportunity. From the
imperialist Henry Kissinger (1982), to the theorist of embedded
liberalism, John Ruggie (Bhagwati and Ruggie 1984) and the historical
materialist Robert W. Cox (1981), all agreed. The demise of the NIEO
proved that it had never stood a chance. This dismissive consensus
became the baseline assumption across the social sciences, including in
development studies. The pioneering Global Political Economist, Susan
Strange, went so far as to describe the NIEO's hopes as "an illusion"
(Strange [1988] 2015, 263). In Gilbert Rist's critique of development,
he argued that the NIEO's ambivalent proposals do "no more than
reinforce the existing order of things" (1999, 49-150). There is nothing
wrong with these conclusions, per se.2 The problem is that they were made
without historical research into the decision making which had created
and led the NIEO. To prove that the NIEO was powerless, one must
understand the available options. Had G77 elites considered choices
which, if taken, might have led to more success? In short, no one knew,
and until Vijay Prashad's pioneering histories of the "Third World
Project" (2007; 2014), no one bothered to find out. Instead, the NIEO's
original failure was deemed sufficient evidence to prove its
powerlessness. As a result, scholars and practitioners of development
have largely ignored this most pivotal moment, and the political
strategies that made it possible (For a key exception: Berger and Weber
2014, 14).</p>
<p>Of course, such counterfactual scenarios are imaginary, so can't be
tested with historical research. Still, as C.L.R. James argued, the
point of analysing historical decision making is not just to understand
what actually could have been decided, but to understand what "should"
have been ([1938]1989, 282). It is only through such questions that
consciousness can use the past to guide decision making in the present.
This is made clear in the lead up to the Progressive International's
2024 Havana Congress, when it asked: "Should we form a club of debtor
nations to navigate the crisis of sovereign debt?" This fits a more
general tendency within the movement towards the NIEO's Nkrumahist
strategic tradition. By acknowledging that the original NIEO "was won
through the exercise of collective power in the coordinated production
of petroleum", the PI declares that its own "vision today can only be
realized through the collective action of the South". To explore such
strategic possibilities, Michael Galant (2024) considered the history of
the original NIEO, and concluded that "even a united negotiating front
is only as strong as its underlying balance of power". For Galant, a
member of the PI's Executive Committee, the implication is that the
movement must create "South-South collective action" in the form of a
"new critical minerals cartel" and a "club of debtor nations". As these
statements make clear, the Progressive International's current attempts
at renovating the NIEO are based on a reconsideration of the exact
strategies that were sorely missed during the demise of the original.
The PI knows that it is not enough to simply seek a global
consensus.</p>
<p>Still, the PI has not, for this reason, ignored the NIEO's more
Prebischian goals and strategies. Its <em>Havana Declaration</em> (2023)
calls for a global consensus, or a "Planetary Bloc" supported by "all
peoples and nations". Perhaps most interestingly, however, is the fact
that some of the PI's leaders are drawing –– even if unwittingly –– on
parts of Samir Amin's critique of the NIEO. Within the eclectic
imaginaries of Yanis Varoufakis, the historical echos of both Prebisch
and Amin can be heard in a new strategic synthesis. Like Amin's critique
of "sub-imperialism" within the G77, Varoufakis (2023) has argued the
the PI "must not repeat the mistake" of relying on "the elites of the
Global South". He made this point with a counterfactual, arguing that:
"Our New Non-Aligned Movement will fail if we give it a narrow role of
bringing together the G77 and the BRICS in opposition to the West."
Varoufakis also reflects the NIEO's more moderate goals, even as
Prebisch is sidelined for "Green Keynesianism" (See also: Schwartz
2023). While believing like Prebisch that such reforms would address
capitalist crises, Varoufakis is skeptical that the capitalist class
will support "the very road that leads to its own salvation." Instead,
he calls for “Genuine democracy” that will “be practised in the
citizens’ and the workers’ assemblies; not behind closed doors where
secretive oligarchs gather.” This is indicative of a key trend within
the PI's "renovation" of the NIEO. In this new, still somewhat implicit
strategy, the PI is attempting to empower a NIEO from below, via the its
movement of movements, or grass roots social forces.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>By focusing on the counterfactuals used by Amin, Nkrumah and
Prebisch, this article traced the broad strategies that underlined the
original NIEO, and which continue to shape the PI's efforts to
"renovate" the project. This is important for both development studies
and the development industry, which have largely assumed that "there is
no alternative" to neo-liberal globalisation. The history of the
original NIEO, and the work of the PI, challenges these assumptions, for
both projects reflect real alternatives, or different strategic options.
The original NIEO failed, but it also succeeded. It succeeded in
creating a global solidarity which possessed powerful decision making
options. Its unique strategic synthesis continues to pose important
"what if?s": what might have been possible then and what might be
possible now? As the NIEO was crushed during a global debt crisis, the
PI reconsiders the possibilities of a debtors' cartel. In this way, the
history of the NIEO continues to present alternative choices. To ignore
this is to ignore the past, present and possible futures of
neo-colonialism, global capitalism, and –– indeed –– "development".</p>
