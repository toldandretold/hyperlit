 A Non-Aligned Common Front: Strategic Imaginaries of the New
International Economic Order (NIEO)
</p>
<p>
 Fifty years after the Sixth Special Session, the Progressive
International (PI) has declared a strategy of "renovating the NIEO".
However, key questions remain about the decisions that created and led
the original campaign. The NIEO's draft declarations were brought to the
UN General Assembly by the leaders of 95 states, caucused as the G77.
Their solidarity was necessarily pluralistic, drawing on Marxist and
Liberal visions of what Adom Getachew called &ldquo;post-imperial
worldmaking&rdquo;. This raises the question of how this global "common front"
was possible, and what the PI might do differently this time. As a
partial explanation, I compare two of the project's strategic
imaginaries, showing that they were successfully synthesised in
practice. As this legacy inspires the PI's focus on the possibilities of
sovereign debt crises, the NIEO continues to play an important
historical role. It alludes to possible options, or alternative futures,
of world order and global development.

 This article is part of a Special Issue commemorating the fiftieth
anniversary of the campaign for a NIEO
 (
 <a class="in-text-citation" href="#assemblygeneralnationsungaunited1974a">
  UN 1974a
 </a>
 ;
 1974b
 )
 , but the
project's significance transcends the past. Right now, the Progressive
International (PI) is seeking to "Renew the Non-Aligned Movement" and
"Renovate the NIEO"
 (
 <a class="in-text-citation" href="#havana2023">
  Havana Congress 2023
 </a>
 )
 . The original project
attempted to resolve an uncertain world economic crisis by reaching a
global consensus on the reformation of the post-WWII world order, or the
rules and institutions of global trade, finance and debt. For example,
the
 <em>
  Declaration on the Establishment of a NIEO
 </em>
 explained that:
"Since 1970, the world economy has experienced a series of grave crises
which have had severe repercussions, especially on the developing
countries because of their generally greater vulnerability to external
economic impulses." It also stated that it had been "impossible to
achieve an even and balanced development of the international community
under the existing international economic order"
 (
 <a class="in-text-citation" href="#assemblygeneralnationsungaunited1974a">
  UN 1974a
 </a>
 )
 . The passing
of the NIEO's founding declarations led to a wholesale reconsideration,
across the entire United Nations system, of the global architecture of
development. After the "assassination" of the NIEO Project by US
imperialist elites
 (
 <a class="in-text-citation" href="#prashad2007">
  Prashad 2007
 </a>
 )
 , these strategic debates were silenced
by a neo-colonial "common sense". For decades, Development Studies and
the development industry have largely assumed that "there is no
alternative" to neo-liberal globalisation
 (
 <a class="in-text-citation" href="#berger2014">
  Berger and Weber 2014, 24-25,

 ;
 Fisher 2009
 ;
 <a class="in-text-citation" href="#prashad2007">
  Prashad 2007, 214-219
 </a>
 )
 . The PI's goal of renovating the
NIEO is a renewed attempt at creating precisely such alternatives.
</p>
<p>
 Launched in May 2020, the PI is a movement of movements aiming to
unite progressive forces globally, and its NIEO campaign is based on a
sober assessment of the original. In calling to seize "the opportunity
of the present historical juncture", its
 <em>
  Havana Declaration On The
NIEO
 </em>
 notes that "the crisis of the existing world system can either
entrench inequalities or embolden the call to reclaim Southern
protagonism"
 (
 <a class="in-text-citation" href="#havana2023">
  Havana Congress 2023
 </a>
 )
 . This is a lesson from the rise and
decline of the solidarity of the original NIEO campaign. Initially, when
the Non-Aligned Movement leveraged the new power of the Organization of
the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), "Southern protagonism" was
emboldened. However, this was eventually crushed during the so-called
Third World Debt Crisis. This presents the Progressive International
with the problem of understanding, as Yanis Varoufakis
 (
 <a class="in-text-citation" href="#varoufakisyanis2023">
  2023
 </a>
 )
 has asked:
"Why did we lose last time round?" Unfortunately, the academic
literature is still struggling to answer this question. Despite the
historical reconsideration of the NIEO that followed Vijay Prashad's
pioneering histories of "the Third World Project"
 (

 </a>
 ;
 <a class="in-text-citation" href="#schwartz2023">

 , fundamental questions remain about
the NIEO's strategic decision making
 (
 <a class="in-text-citation" href="#thornton2022">
  Thornton 2022
 </a>
 ;
 Venzka 2018
 )
 . This
article provides a partial, and broad-brush answer. By relying on the
method of C.L.R. James, I trace the counterfactuals &ndash;&ndash; or imaginary
"what if?" scenarios &ndash;&ndash; that animated two of the NIEO's dominant
strategic imaginaries. That is, the imaginary futures which were used to
devise and decide between the available options, or strategic choices. I
then show how these strategic imaginaries were synthesised, first
theoretically and then in practice. This is important, I argue, because
the same strategic imaginaries continue to inspire the efforts of the
Progressive International to revive the project. This proves, as Nils
Gilman
 (
 <a class="in-text-citation" href="#gilman2023">
  2023
 </a>
 )
 has argued, that the NIEO is a "usable past". It offers
badly needed alternatives to world order and global development.
</p>
<p>
 The question of strategic decision making
</p>
<p>
 By the early 1980s, scholars began to realise that the core proposals
of the NIEO would not be implemented. Instead, G77 solidarity crumbled
amidst the so-called Third World Debt Crisis
 (
 <a class="in-text-citation" href="#prashad2007">
  Prashad 2007, 210
 </a>
 )
 . In
this climate, a strange consensus emerged amongst those who had once
viewed it as either a serious threat or opportunity. From the
imperialist Henry Kissinger
 (
 <a class="in-text-citation" href="#henrykissinger1982">
  1982
 </a>
 )
 , to the theorist of embedded
liberalism, John Ruggie
 (
 <a class="in-text-citation" href="#bhagwati1984">
  Bhagwati and Ruggie 1984
 </a>
 )
 and the historical
materialist Robert W. Cox
 (
 <a class="in-text-citation" href="#cox1981">
  1981
 </a>
 )
 , all agreed. The demise of the NIEO
proved that it had never stood a chance. This dismissive consensus
became the baseline assumption across the social sciences, including in
development studies. The pioneering Global Political Economist, Susan
Strange, went so far as to describe the NIEO's hopes as "an illusion"
 (
 <a class="in-text-citation" href="#strange2015">
  Strange [1988] 2015, 263
 </a>
 )
 . In Gilbert Rist's critique of development,
he argued that the NIEO's ambivalent proposals do "no more than
reinforce the existing order of things"
 (
 1999, 49-150
 )
 . There is nothing
wrong with these conclusions, per se. The problem is that they were made
without historical research into the decision making which had created
and led the NIEO. To prove that the NIEO was powerless, one must
understand the available options. Had G77 elites considered choices
which, if taken, might have led to more success? In short, no one knew,
and until Vijay Prashad's pioneering histories of the "Third World
Project"
 (
 2007
 ;
 2014
 )
 , no one bothered to find out. Instead, the NIEO's
original failure was deemed sufficient evidence to prove its
powerlessness. As a result, scholars and practitioners of development
have largely ignored this most pivotal moment, and the political
strategies that made it possible
 (
 For a key exception: Berger and Weber
2014, 14
 )
 .
</p>
<p>
 This dismissive consensus rested on a rejection of the counterfactual
analysis that is essential for making and understanding decisions.
Counterfactuals are imagined, "what if?" scenarios. For Robert W. Cox,
the rejection of counterfactuals was explicit. He viewed them as "the
stuff of idealism rather than of historical materialism"
 (
 <a class="in-text-citation" href="#cox1991">
  Cox 1991,
175
 </a>
 )
 . Without counterfactual analysis, however, Cox was unable to
properly consider the decision making, and therefore power, of the NIEO
project. This can be appreciated by considering the method of C.L.R.
James, whose groundbreaking research uncovered the previously neglected
power that had created and led the Haitian Revolution. In
 <em>
  The Black
Jacobins
 </em>
 (
 [1938] 1989
 )
 , James explored the key decisions made by
the leaders of global social forces. To do so, he relied extensively on
counterfactuals. For example, he analysed not just Napoleon's decision
to invade Haiti, but his deeply-considered option not to
 (
 <a class="in-text-citation" href="#james1989">
  James [1938]
1989, 270-271, 373
 </a>
 )
 . In doing so, James considered not just what
happened, but what
 <em>
  might have been if
 </em>
 things had been decided
differently. This meant imagining entirely different futures for world
order (136). For example, James reasoned that with better leadership
Napoleon's attack on the nation of freed slaves "would have been
crippled at the start" (299-300). From this position of strength the
former slave and revolutionary leader, Toussaint, might have succeeded
in forming an alliance with the French republic (285). In doing so,
James showed how imaginary "what if?" scenarios are foundational to
decision making. To choose between option a, b, or c, a person imagines
 <em>
  what would happen if
 </em>
 each option were taken. To understand the
agency that created and led the original NIEO, therefore, it is
necessary to search for the counterfactuals that the project relied on,
even if implicitly.
</p>
<p>
 Of course, understanding the decision making that created and led the
NIEO is difficult
 (
 <a class="in-text-citation" href="#ingovenzke2018">
  Venzke 2018
 </a>
 )
 . As C.L.R. James
 (
 <a class="in-text-citation" href="#james1989">
  [1938] 1989, x
 </a>
 )
 was
well aware, decisions are not made in a vacuum. They are embedded within
historical forces which people did not choose. The NIEO presents
additional difficulties, for it was created by political leaders and
diplomats from 95 diverse states, who held contradictory beliefs about
the possibilities of changing the post-WWII world order
 (
 <a class="in-text-citation" href="#thornton2022">
  Thornton 2022
 </a>
 ;
 <a class="in-text-citation" href="#lal2015">
  Lal 2015
 </a>
 ;
 <a class="in-text-citation" href="#byrne2016">
  Byrne 2016
 </a>
 )
 . This was shown brilliantly in Adom Getachew's
 (
 2019
 )
 <em>
  Worldmaking After Empire
 </em>
 , which offers a deep
exploration of the NIEO's intellectual foundations. In doing so,
Getachew traced the project's ideological contradictions, including the
fact that it had been "Marxist in its diagnosis of economic dependence"
but liberal in terms of its prescriptions
 (
 2019, 145
 )
 . For Getachew,
this was only one of the project's many "internal limitations and
inconsistencies", which were only hidden because "external challenges
ensured that the project never had the opportunity for its internal
contradictions to unfold" (171). This argument is similar to Cox's
original claim that the NIEO lacked "a sufficiently clear view of an
alternative world political economy"
 (
 Cox 1982, 150-151
 )
 , and to Henry
Kissinger's claim that the NIEO's "philosophical framework seems to me
to be extremely elusive"
 (
 1982, 153
 )
 . Others have gone further, arguing
that the group's internal contradictions rendered it incapable of
negotiating its core demands
 (
 <a class="in-text-citation" href="#thomasweiss1986">
  Weiss 1986, 6-7, 44-47
 </a>
 ;
 <a class="in-text-citation" href="#amritanarlikar2003">
  Narlikar 2003,
58-69.
 </a>
 )
 . In other words, there never were alternative options which G77
elites could have taken.
</p>
<p>
 This theory that the original NIEO had been so marred by internal
disagreements, and so lacking in a coherent vision of an alternative,
raises the question of how the project had been possible in the first
place. How could so many different state elites, with deep ideological
and material conflicts, create a global solidarity that forced
imperialists &ndash;&ndash; like Kissinger &ndash;&ndash; to negotiate? For the astonishing
thing about the NIEO is not that it had so many ideological and material
contradictions. That is a necessary part of any global solidarity. What
is remarkable is that these contradictions were synthesised in praxis.
To show this, I draw on C.L.R. James' counterfactual analysis to trace
the strategic imaginaries that inspired the decision making of the
original NIEO. Of course, it is beyond the scope of this article to
consider the many decisions made by each individual G77 elite. Instead,
I trace the counterfactual analyses used in two of the NIEO's
foundational theories of global development, Kwame Nkrumah's
 <em>
  Neocolonialism: The Last Stage of Imperialism
 </em>
 (
 1965
 )
 , and Ra&uacute;l
Prebisch&rsquo;s
 <em>
  Towards a New Trade Policy For Development
 </em>
 (
 1964
 )
 .
Each text relied on distinct counterfactual claims about what NIEO-style
reforms would achieve. Nkrumah saw them as useful for the eventual goal
of creating global socialism. Prebisch saw them as temporary measures
useful for creating a properly functioning global capitalist system.
Nevertheless, at the level of world order Nrkumah's Leninism and
Prebisch's liberalism overlapped
 (
 <a class="in-text-citation" href="#nicholls2019">
  Nicholls 2019, 59-61
 </a>
 )
 . Even if Nkrumah
and Prebisch disagreed about what NIEO-style reforms to world order
would achieve, they both supported the reforms
 (
 <a class="in-text-citation" href="#bockman2015">
  Bockman 2015
 </a>
 )
 . Here lies
the theoretical basis, I argue, for the non-aligned common front that
created and led the original NIEO campaign. This contradictory synthesis
allowed the G77 to win support from Leninists to Liberals, and anyone in
between. Whether one sought global socialism, or properly-functioning
global free trade, there was a historical, and therefore counterfactual,
case to be made for NIEO-style reforms.
</p>
<p>
 Of courese, the common front's divergent goals reflected
contradictory social forces
 (
 <a class="in-text-citation" href="#aminsamir1982">
  Amin 1982, 445
 </a>
 ;
 <a class="in-text-citation" href="#prashad2007">
  Prashad 2007, 52
 </a>
 )
 . By
envisioning, and seeking, a properly-functioning global capitalism,
Prebisch believed NIEO-style reforms would be equally beneficial to the
core and periphery. This implied a strategy of seeking a consensus with
capitalist elites in the core. Nkrumah disagreed. He thought the idea
that "the developed nations should effectively assist the poorer parts
of the world" had "little prospect" of taking place
 (
 <a class="in-text-citation" href="#nkrumah1965">
  Nkrumah 1965, xix
 </a>
 )
 .
He imagined that NIEO-style reforms would be damaging to the interests
of imperialists. Thus, instead of seeking global consensus, non-aligned
elites should forge collective independence. In practice, both
strategies were synthesised. First, OPEC elites acted in accordance with
Nkrumah&rsquo;s strategic vision. Working collectively, they seized control of
the global oil market, which heightened the global crisis. Then, this
new power was used to call for the Sixth Special Session of the UN
General Assembly. There, the G77 acted in accordance with the
Prebischian strategy of seeking global consensus. Thus, collective
independence that deepened global crisis was used to power the
possibility of a global consensus that benefited the North and South
alike.
</p>
<p>
 For C.L.R. James, the point of counterfactual analysis was not simply
to understand the history of past decision making. It was to use this
history to inform strategic decision making in the present. For James,
this meant asking not just what could have been decided, but what should
have been
 (
 <a class="in-text-citation" href="#james1989">
  James [1938] 1989, 282
 </a>
 )
 . It is for this purpose that Yanis
Varoufakis
 (
 <a class="in-text-citation" href="#varoufakisyanis2023">
  2023
 </a>
 )
 has called on the PI to ask itself: "Why did we lose
last time round?" Curiously, similar questions were asked by Samir Amin
 (
 <a class="in-text-citation" href="#aminsamir1982">
  1982
 </a>
 )
 during the project's demise. Despite agreeing with the emerging
consensus that the NIEO had been powerless, Amin embraced counterfactual
analysis. This allowed him to ask key questions of the project's praxis,
including whether it had failed because of "tactical errors", or
unpredictable economic contingencies
 (
 <a class="in-text-citation" href="#aminsamir1982">
  Amin 1982, 436
 </a>
 )
 . For Amin, there
was nothing that G77 elites could have done to avoid the destruction
brought in the wake of the NIEO. In fact, he thought the G77's "common
front" had been dangerous. As such, this article starts with Amin.
</p>
<p>
 Samir Amin's Leninist Rejection of the NIEO
</p>
<p>
 Despite contributing to the scholarly consensus that the NIEO's
failure was inevitable, Samir Amin's historical materialism did not
ignore questions of the project's decision making. He asked whether "the
factors behind the clearly visible failure" were "purely contingent"
aspects of the economic crisis, or "traceable to the 'tactical errors'
of the Third World"
 (
 <a class="in-text-citation" href="#aminsamir1982">
  Amin 1982, 436
 </a>
 )
 . Amin could consider decision
making because he was open to counterfactual analysis
 (
 <a class="in-text-citation" href="#heikki2019">
  Patom&auml;ki 2019
 </a>
 )
 .
Indeed, his answer to these questions drew upon an imaginary "what if?"
scenario. He asked what it would mean if the G77 succeeded in
"transforming this dependency relationship and compelling the adjustment
of the world system":
</p>
<p>
 If that should turn out to be the case one should be able to look
back on imperialism as merely a stage - an intermediate stage - in the
expansion of capitalism on a world scale and not as the highest stage of
capitalism; it would have proved, that is, as the stage that ushered in
the transition from a system characterised by the asymmetrical
centre-periphery relationships that define it to a homogeneous global
system dominated by capitalist relations.
 (
 <a class="in-text-citation" href="#aminsamir1982">
  Amin 1982, 441-2
 </a>
 )
</p>
<p>
 In this sense, the NIEO project was an important experiment, which
tested the nature of imperialism itself. To explain why he thought the
project could never have succeeded, Amin constructed a theoretically
consistent account of imperialism, understood as a stage of capitalism
dominated by global monopoly capital. Within this Leninist imaginary,
the G77's "common front" was defined by its ruling classes
 (
 <a class="in-text-citation" href="#aminsamir1982">
  Amin 1982,
445
 </a>
 )
 . Thus, whereas some advocates described the G77 as a group of
"proletarian nations", or a "trade union of the poor"
 (
 <a class="in-text-citation" href="#getachew2019">
  Getachew 2019,
168
 </a>
 ;
 <a class="in-text-citation" href="#sauvant2014">
  Sauvant 2014, 9
 </a>
 ;
 <a class="in-text-citation" href="#moyn2019">
  Moyn 2019, 103-104
 </a>
 )
 , Amin defined them as a group
of "peripheral capitalist states and their bourgeoisies"
 (
 <a class="in-text-citation" href="#aminsamir1982">
  Amin 1982,
432
 </a>
 )
 . In their struggle to industrialise, the peripheral bourgeoisies
were opposed by "the monopolies and the imperialist states". Despite
this resistance to the core, Amin noted that the NIEO "permits an
increase in the rate of profit on a world scale and can only be read
therefore, as a contribution to global capitalist development." What's
more, Amin pointed to the problem of "sub-imperialism" within the G77,
and argued that the NIEO had the "effect of turning the Third World into
a fair game for the rival superpowers"
 (
 1982, 447-8
 )
 .
</p>
<p>
 Despite imagining the NIEO as both dangerous and ultimately
powerless, Amin did not, like other historical materialists, ignore
non-Western agency
 (
 <a class="in-text-citation" href="#alinahobsonjohnsajed2017">
  Hobson and Sajed 2017
 </a>
 )
 . To explain the "atmosphere"
which had made it "possible to contemplate" a NIEO, Amin pointed to a
global upsurge of popular forces across the global South
 (
 1982, 439
 ;
 see
also: Berger and Weber 2014, 70-71
 ;
 <a class="in-text-citation" href="#prashad2007">
  Prashad 2007, 2014
 </a>
 )
 , and predicted a
"new wave of popular struggles" (447-448). Citing the anti-colonial
revolutions that had created the post-WWII world order, Amin looked
towards the future. "Not for the first time," he argued, "the peoples of
the Third World may well lead the process of world transformation"
(447-448). This critique has devastating implications for the
Progressive International (PI). If Amin is right, their is no point in
attempting to "Renovate the NIEO". Instead, the PI would be better
placed to focus solely on the development of domestic, and revolutionary
social forces. However, other counterfactuals are possible.
</p>
<p>
 The strategic imaginary of Kwame Nkrumah
</p>
<p>
 Nkrumah agreed with Amin that imperialism was the final stage of
capitalism. His classic work on neo-colonialism had not revised Lenin's
theory, but applied it to the post-WWII world order, a point which
Nkrumah made explicit:
</p>
<p>
 Colonialism has achieved a new guise. It has become neo-colonialism,
the last stage of imperialism; its final bid for existence, as
monopoly-capitalism or imperialism is the last stage of capitalism.
 (
 1965, 31
 )
</p>
<p>
 Thus, like Amin, Nkrumah understood the task of economic development
in the periphery as a struggle against "the empire of finance capital"
(35-36). Unlike Amin, Nkrumah
 (
 <a class="in-text-citation" href="#nkrumah1965">
  1965, 32
 </a>
 )
 adopted a working relationship
with this empire, arguing that "it is impossible for any of us to avoid
dealing with monopoly in some form or another." He believed that with
international solidarity, non-aligned state elites could "maintain the
integrity of our financial institutions" and "leave ourselves room to
manoeuvre away" from neo-colonialism
 (
 <a class="in-text-citation" href="#nkrumah1965">
  Nkrumah 1965, 32
 </a>
 )
 . Here, his focus
was on pan-Africanism, but he also supported "a strengthening of the
Afro-Asian Solidarity Organisation and the spirit of Bandung", as well
as solidarity "on an increasingly formal basis" with "our Latin American
brothers"
 (
 <a class="in-text-citation" href="#nkrumah1965">
  Nkrumah 1965, 253-254
 </a>
 )
 . Thus, whereas Amin criticised the
NIEO's common-front strategy, Nkrumah helped create it. He argued that
newly-independent states must act "in a combination that will give
strength to our bargaining power and eliminate so many of the
duplications that give greater force and greater advantage to the
imperialists and their strategy of neo-colonialism"
 (
 <a class="in-text-citation" href="#nkrumah1965">
  Nkrumah 1965,
30-31
 </a>
 )
 .
</p>
<p>
 In calling for international solidarity, Nkrumah &ndash;&ndash; like other
socialists &ndash;&ndash; had not opposed foreign direct investment or free trade
 (
 <a class="in-text-citation" href="#amabiney2011">
  Biney 2011, 108
 </a>
 ;
 <a class="in-text-citation" href="#bockman2015">
  Bockman 2015
 </a>
 )
 . Indeed, he had imagined global reforms
that would become key pillars of the NIEO. Besides calling to overthrow
neo-colonialism
 (
 <a class="in-text-citation" href="#unga1974b">
  UNGA 1974b, Chapter II, Section 1(a
 </a>
 )
 : i-xii), the
founding declarations called for:
</p>
<p>
 aid to be distributed multilaterally

<p>
 a "continental code to govern foreign investment"

 ; and

<p>
 support for increased free trade

 </a>
 )
 ).
</p>
<p>
 Nkrumah did not believe these reforms would succeed in isolation, but
thought they would be useful. By mitigating the worst effects of
imperialism, these proposals would boost economic development in the
periphery, and heighten the contradiction between capital and labour in
the imperial core
 (
 <a class="in-text-citation" href="#nkrumah1965">
  Nkrumah 1965, 255-256
 </a>
 )
 . Lenin
 (
 <a class="in-text-citation" href="#ilyichleninvladimir2008">

 )
 had
argued that monopolistic "superprofits" allowed imperialists to "bribe
the labour leaders and the upper stratum of the labour aristocracy."
Nkrumah built on this directly, reasoning that any mitigation of
superprofits would heighten class conflict in the core:
</p>
<p>
 When Africa becomes economically free and politically united, the
monopolists will come face to face with their own working class in their
own countries, and a new struggle will arise within which the
liquidation and collapse of imperialism will be complete.
 (
 1965,
255-256
 )
</p>
<p>
 Of course, Nkrumah never imagined that this would be possible solely
with NIEO-style reforms. Nor did he imagine that they would be won
through diplomatic consensus
 (
 Getachew 2009, 149-150
 )
 . Within his
imaginary, NIEO-style reforms would damage the interests of imperialist
elites. As such, Nkrumah focused on building non-aligned coalitions, and
regional ordering, like his proposed "All-African Union Government"
 (
 <a class="in-text-citation" href="#nkrumah1965">
  Nkrumah 1965, 35-36
 </a>
 ;
 <a class="in-text-citation" href="#getachew2019">
  Getachew 2019, 102
 </a>
 )
 . This was justified by his
counterfactual analysis, or strategic imaginary. For if NIEO-style
reforms would assist economic development in the periphery while
heightening class contradictions in the imperial core, then there was
little chance of imperialist concessions. Instead, non-aligned elites
would have to create NIEO-style reforms and institutions themselves.
Importantly, this aspect of Nkrumah's
 <em>
  Neo-colonialism
 </em>
 isn't
found in the NIEO's founding declarations. These claimed that the NIEO
would be just as beneficial to the core as to the periphery. Nkrumah's
strategic imaginary should be understood as operating beneath the
surface of these formal, diplomatic documents. Indeed, his strategy of
collective independence was a core part of the Non-Aligned Movement. As
I show bellow, it was this collective independence that had underlined
the NIEO's initial moment of possibility.
</p>
<p>
 Ra&uacute;l Prebisch's strategy of a liberal consensus
</p>
<p>
 Whereas Nkrumah imagined NIEO-style reforms as useful for creating
global socialism, Prebisch believed they would help create a global
capitalism that functioned as it was already supposed to. As his report
as the founding Secretary General of UNCTAD made clear, Prebisch sought
to achieve this by reforming the post-WWII Bretton Woods system from
within. Take, for example, his criticism of the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade (GATT), the precursor to the World Trade Organisation
(WTO). Prebisch didn't oppose its core goal of promoting free trade, but
its historical blindness. It ignored the fact that the benefits of free
trade did not apply between "the industrially advanced and the
developing countries"
 (
 <a class="in-text-citation" href="#prebisch1964">
  Prebisch 1964, 29
 </a>
 ;
 <a class="in-text-citation" href="#bockman2015">
  Bockman 2015, 115
 </a>
 )
 . For, as
Prebisch established alongside Hans Singer, exports from the periphery
showed a long-term tendency to decline relative to their industrial
imports
 (
 <a class="in-text-citation" href="#jfj2003">
  Toye 2003
 </a>
 )
 . Thus, if the GATT's rules and norms were applied
equally between the core and periphery, they would constrain, rather
than help, economic development
 (
 <a class="in-text-citation" href="#prebisch1964">
  Prebisch 1964
 </a>
 )
 . To amend this, Prebisch
sought to unify the newly-formed G77 behind a set of reforms aimed at
supporting peripheral industrialisation
 (
 <a class="in-text-citation" href="#dosman2008">
  Dosman 2008, 394-395
 </a>
 )
 . These
measures included a real transfer of wealth from the core to the
periphery and the establishment of commodity agreements to regulate and
increase the price of peripheral exports. Like Nkrumah, Prebisch never
believed that these reforms would be sufficient. He made this point with
a counterfactual, imagining that:
</p>
<p>
 If the peripheral countries manage to secure a larger share for their
primary exports in the consumption of the industrial countries, this,
together with the transfer of income from the latter countries to the
former to offset the effects of the deterioration in the terms of trade,
will help to narrow the trade gap but will not in itself be enough to
close it.
 (
 <a class="in-text-citation" href="#prebisch1964">
  Prebisch 1964, 20
 </a>
 )
</p>
<p>
 What's more, none of Prebisch's proposed reforms were intended to be
permanent
 (
 1964, 31
 )
 . As peripheral industrialisation grew, the
"disparity" with the core "can be levelled out gradually"
 (
 <a class="in-text-citation" href="#prebisch1964">
  Prebisch
1964, 31
 </a>
 )
 . Indeed, Prebisch wrote that: "With an effort of the
imagination it is possible to visualise a situation of dynamic
equilibrium in the distant future in which [the declining terms of
trade] disappears as a result of the world-wide process of
industrialization"
 (
 <a class="in-text-citation" href="#prebisch1964">
  Prebisch 1964, 15
 </a>
 )
 .
</p>
<p>
 Here lies the biggest difference between Prebisch and Nkrumah. For
Prebisch, NIEO-style reforms would not significantly threaten the
profits of state elites from the global North. For these were not
radical nor permanent reforms, and would have the effect of increasing
economic development in both the core and periphery. This had important
strategic implications. If true, the G77 could create global reforms to
world order through "joint responsibilities, common objectives, and
convergent measures"
 (
 Prebisch 1984, 183
 )
 . This strategic imaginary was
a fundamental part the NIEO's founding declarations, which claimed that
it would help both North and South alike
 (
 <a class="in-text-citation" href="#assemblygeneralnationsungaunited1974a">
  UN 1974a
 </a>
 )
 . It also shaped the
G77's legal strategy, which sought to reform the United Nations from
within, on the basis of global consensus
 (
 <a class="in-text-citation" href="#bedjaoui1979">
  Bedjaoui 1979, 196-197
 </a>
 )
 . It is
this moderate tendency that scholars have used to describe the NIEO as
an essentially "Keynesian liberal" project
 (

 .
</p>
<p>
 Decision making: the strategic imaginaries in practice
</p>
<p>
 So far, this article has shown that Nkrumah and Prebisch contributed
conflicting visions of what NIEO-style reforms would achieve, and how
they could be created. The more radical strategy of collective
independence was promoted within the NAM, which Nkrumah helped found
 (
 <a class="in-text-citation" href="#sauvant2014">
  Sauvant 2014, 5
 </a>
 )
 . The more moderate strategy of seeking a global
consensus was promoted within UNCTAD, which Prebisch helped found, and
the G77
 (
 Prebisch 1984, 183
 )
 . In this section, I turn to consider how
these strategies related to the rise and decline of the original NIEO.
In key turning points, how did G77 elites choose between the options
made available by these two strategic traditions? I argue that the NIEO
was created by a non-aligned common front that was originally empowered
by a synthesis of both strategies. Initially, in late 1973, Western
elites used the petrodollar crisis as a pretext to end the IMF's
"radical" attempt at creating "a quantum jump into a new [monetary]
system"
 (
 <a class="in-text-citation" href="#boardexecutiveimf1972">
  IMF 1972, 4
 </a>
 ;
 <a class="in-text-citation" href="#degarritsenmargaretvries1985">
  De Vries 1985, 240-242
 </a>
 )
 . In response, Algerian
president Houari Boum&eacute;di&egrave;ne leveraged OPEC's new power to call for the
Sixth Special Session, where decisions would be made on all matters of
global development
 (
 <a class="in-text-citation" href="#sauvant2014">
  Sauvant 2014, 5
 </a>
 )
 . In this way, the strategy of
collective independence, via the NAM and OPEC, was used to empower the
strategy of reaching a global consensus within the UN General Assembly
 (
 UNGA 1974
 )
 .
</p>
<p>
 This strategic synthesis, which empowered the NIEO's initial moment
of possibility, peaked at the Seventh Special Session in September 1975.
At this time, the world economic crisis had been marked by continued
uncertainty, and a decline in the value of the recently-floated
US-dollar. This reduced the value of OPEC's petrodollar surpluses, and
made OPEC's
 (
 <a class="in-text-citation" href="#opec1975">
  1975
 </a>
 )
 <em>
  Solemn Declaration
 </em>
 all the more believable.
In it, OPEC heads of state explicitly tied their oil and financial power
to the goal of a NIEO. This had an obvious effect. In the lead up to the
Seventh Special Session, CIA analysts feared what they called "the
radicals, led by Algeria"
 (
 <a class="in-text-citation" href="#cia1975">
  CIA 1975
 </a>
 )
 . Because the radicals wanted "a big
transfer of resources" and "have a lot of power", the CIA argued that a
"compromise may need to be struck in regards to commodities". This
accords with Kissinger's strategy at the Special Session, which
projected what appeared like a genuine willingness to compromise
 (

 </a>
 ;
 <a class="in-text-citation" href="#dietrich2017">
  Dietrich 2017, 284-289
 </a>
 )
 .
However, by the end of the Paris Conference on International Economic
Cooperation (CIEC) in 1977, the exchange rate of the US-dollar seemed to
have stabilised. As OPEC's capital appeared relatively more stable
within a US-led order, the option of investing in the NIEO became
relatively more risky
 (
 <a class="in-text-citation" href="#nicholls2019">
  Nicholls 2019, 146-149
 </a>
 )
 . Through massive
increases in US arms sales, Iran and Saudi Arabia chose instead to
strengthen ties with imperialism
 (

 ;
 <a class="in-text-citation" href="#prashad2007">
  Prashad 2007, 186-189
 </a>
 ;
 Wright 2014
 )
 . As a
result, US negotiators dropped their apparent willingness to compromise.
Indeed, at the CIEC, they dismissed all concerns about the growing debt
crisis, claiming that it would fix itself
 (
 <a class="in-text-citation" href="#una1976">
  UNA 1976
 </a>
 ;
 <a class="in-text-citation" href="#nicholls2019">
  Nicholls 2019,
150-151
 </a>
 )
 . With the conference ending in failure, G77 solidarity
collapsed.
</p>
<p>
 The rise and decline of this original strategic synthesis raises two
counterfactual questions. First, as Samir Amin considered in 1982, is
the question of unpredictable economic contingencies. What if the
economic crisis had deepened, from 1975-1977, rather than apparently
stabilising? Would key OPEC elites have then been more likely to finance
experiments in the NIEO, like UNCTAD's proposed Common Fund? Even if the
Common Fund failed to underlie a new wave of commodity price agreements,
it seems likely that significant OPEC investment would have boosted G77
solidarity, for it would have legitimised the strategic synthesis that
had made the NIEO project possible in the first place. Secondly, if G77
solidarity had been strengthened before the debt crisis, could the group
have formed a debtors' cartel, as proposed by Cuba?
 (
 <a class="in-text-citation" href="#prashad2007">
  Prashad 2007,
214-219
 </a>
 )
 The counterfactual of a debtors' cartel is tantalising because
of how close the world economic crisis came, even without a cartel, to
collapsing the US financial system
 (
 <a class="in-text-citation" href="#corbridge1993">
  Corbridge 1993, 44-45
 </a>
 ;
 <a class="in-text-citation" href="#helleiner1996">

1996, 176
 </a>
 ;
 <a class="in-text-citation" href="#markmazower2013">
  Mazower 2013, 351
 </a>
 )
 . To avoid a collapse, US state and
financial elites employed their own strategy of collective independence,
wielding the full weight of their monopoly finance capital to quash
economic development in South America and Africa for over a decade
 (
 <a class="in-text-citation" href="#bazbauers2021">
  Bazbauers and Engel 2021
 </a>
 ;
 <a class="in-text-citation" href="#easterly2001">

 </a>
 ;
 <a class="in-text-citation" href="#harvey2005">
  Harvey 2005, 29
 </a>
 ;
 <a class="in-text-citation" href="#prashadvijay2014">
  Prashad 2014,
5-7
 </a>
 ;
 <a class="in-text-citation" href="#francesstewart2012">
  Stewart 2012, 88, 92
 </a>
 )
 . With a debtors' cartel, things might have
happened differently. By risking a systemic collapse of the
still-bourgeoning neo-liberal world disorder, a debtors' cartel could
have forced the North-South dialogue back to the future of the early
1970s, when most global elites still supported some form of reformed
Bretton Woods
 (
 <a class="in-text-citation" href="#degarritsenmargaretvries1985">
  De Vries 1985, 242-243, 255-256
 </a>
 )
 . Thus, again, the
strategic synthesis between the NIEO's more radical, non-aligned
strategy, and its more moderate, consensus-seeking strategy, would have
helped decide the future of world order, and global development.
</p>
<p>
 Of course, such counterfactual scenarios are imaginary, so can't be
tested with historical research. Still, as C.L.R. James argued, the
point of analysing historical decision making is not just to understand
what actually could have been decided, but to understand what "should"
have been
 (
 <a class="in-text-citation" href="#james1989">
  [1938]1989, 282
 </a>
 )
 . It is only through such questions that
consciousness can use the past to guide decision making in the present.
This is made clear in the lead up to the Progressive International's
2024 Havana Congress, when it asked: "Should we form a club of debtor
nations to navigate the crisis of sovereign debt?" This fits a more
general tendency within the movement towards the NIEO's Nkrumahist
strategic tradition. By acknowledging that the original NIEO "was won
through the exercise of collective power in the coordinated production
of petroleum", the PI declares that its own "vision today can only be
realized through the collective action of the South". To explore such
strategic possibilities, Michael Galant
 (
 <a class="in-text-citation" href="#galantmichael2024">
  2024
 </a>
 )
 considered the history of
the original NIEO, and concluded that "even a united negotiating front
is only as strong as its underlying balance of power". For Galant, a
member of the PI's Executive Committee, the implication is that the
movement must create "South-South collective action" in the form of a
"new critical minerals cartel" and a "club of debtor nations". As these
statements make clear, the Progressive International's current attempts
at renovating the NIEO are based on a reconsideration of the exact
strategies that were sorely missed during the demise of the original.
The PI knows that it is not enough to simply seek a global
consensus.
</p>
<p>
 Still, the PI has not, for this reason, ignored the NIEO's more
Prebischian goals and strategies. Its
 <em>
  Havana Declaration
 </em>
 (
 2023
 )
 calls for a global consensus, or a "Planetary Bloc" supported by "all
peoples and nations". Perhaps most interestingly, however, is the fact
that some of the PI's leaders are drawing &ndash;&ndash; even if unwittingly &ndash;&ndash; on
parts of Samir Amin's critique of the NIEO. Within the eclectic
imaginaries of Yanis Varoufakis, the historical echos of both Prebisch
and Amin can be heard in a new strategic synthesis. Like Amin's critique
of "sub-imperialism" within the G77, Varoufakis
 (
 <a class="in-text-citation" href="#varoufakisyanis2023">
  2023
 </a>
 )
 has argued the
the PI "must not repeat the mistake" of relying on "the elites of the
Global South". He made this point with a counterfactual, arguing that:
"Our New Non-Aligned Movement will fail if we give it a narrow role of
bringing together the G77 and the BRICS in opposition to the West."
Varoufakis also reflects the NIEO's more moderate goals, even as
Prebisch is sidelined for "Green Keynesianism"
 (
 <a class="in-text-citation" href="#schwartz2023">
  See also: Schwartz
2023
 </a>
 )
 . While believing like Prebisch that such reforms would address
capitalist crises, Varoufakis is skeptical that the capitalist class
will support "the very road that leads to its own salvation." Instead,
he calls for &ldquo;Genuine democracy&rdquo; that will &ldquo;be practised in the
citizens&rsquo; and the workers&rsquo; assemblies; not behind closed doors where
secretive oligarchs gather.&rdquo; This is indicative of a key trend within
the PI's "renovation" of the NIEO. In this new, still somewhat implicit
strategy, the PI is attempting to empower a NIEO from below, via the its
movement of movements, or grass roots social forces.
</p>
<p>
 Conclusion
</p>
<p>
 By focusing on the counterfactuals used by Amin, Nkrumah and
Prebisch, this article traced the broad strategies that underlined the
original NIEO, and which continue to shape the PI's efforts to
"renovate" the project. This is important for both development studies
and the development industry, which have largely assumed that "there is
no alternative" to neo-liberal globalisation. The history of the
original NIEO, and the work of the PI, challenges these assumptions, for
both projects reflect real alternatives, or different strategic options.
The original NIEO failed, but it also succeeded. It succeeded in
creating a global solidarity which possessed powerful decision making
options. Its unique strategic synthesis continues to pose important
"what if?s": what might have been possible then and what might be
possible now? As the NIEO was crushed during a global debt crisis, the
PI reconsiders the possibilities of a debtors' cartel. In this way, the
history of the NIEO continues to present alternative choices. To ignore
this is to ignore the past, present and possible futures of
neo-colonialism, global capitalism, and &ndash;&ndash; indeed &ndash;&ndash; "development".
