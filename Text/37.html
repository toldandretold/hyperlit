    <div class="indent3" id="notei--5">
      The marxological tradition that portrays Marx as an authoritarian has a subtradition, according to which he
      represented the intellectuals’ aspiration for domination over the workers. For it cannot be denied that he was an
      intellectual himself (according to sundry definitions of that term) and of notoriously bourgeois origin at that;
      and it has been proved that he had no inhibition against treating even certified proletarians with disrespect. In
      this connection his definitive offense is sometimes taken to be his confrontation with Wilhelm Weitling in
      Brussels in 1846.<a id="noteien1-r" class="calibre4"></a><a class="nounder4" id="notei--7" href="43.html#noteien1">*</a>
    </div>

    <div class="indent3" id="notei--8">
      The scenario goes as follows. On the one hand there is Weitling, then the best-known figure in the fledgling
      circles of German communism or socialism—ceremoniously referred to in some marxological works as a “born
      proletarian.” On the other hand, there is the bourgeois intellectual Marx, seconded by the Manchester capitalist
      Engels, both of whom in 1846 are engaged in plotting to take over the communist movement. This is a very bold
      plot, since there is no such movement as yet. At a portentous meeting on March 30, 1846, the Intellectual argues
      the hapless Proletarian down, and seizes control—of something—thus dramatizing the Dictatorship of the
      Intellectuals over the proletariat.
    </div>

    <div class="indent3" id="notei--9">
      This is a stirring tale, but the facts are even more interesting. To get at them, some irrelevancies must first
      be cleared away.
    </div>

    <div class="indent3" id="notei--10">
      1. There was no decision-making meeting involved. There was a discussion gathering of members of the Communist
      Correspondence Committee, which was Marx’s creation. Weitling had been living in London, where he was losing
      influence; on his way back to the Continent he stopped in Brussels, where he was invited to discuss his <a id="page_655" class="calibre4"></a>views at Marx’s house. There was no question of a vote on anything—just talk—and there were only a
      handful present besides the principals. The main reason this soirée is well known is that a Russian visitor named
      P. V. Annenkov happened to be present, and in 1880 published an account of it in a book of memoirs. To be sure,
      it is dubious whether Annenkov altogether understood all that went on, or that his memory was fresh a third of a
      century later, but fortunately nothing hinges on this uncertainty.
    </div>

    <div class="indent3" id="notei--12">
      2. There was no problem about combating Weitling’s influence in the movement, though of course this would
      otherwise have had to be done. By this time Weitling had <em id="notei--13" class="calibre19">already</em> lost the support of the
      main circle of German communists abroad, the League of the Just in London (soon to become the Communist League),
      and he enjoyed no credit with the Brussels people around Marx. During the preceding two years, while Weitling had
      been in England, with no Marx around to argue him down, he had succeeded singlehandedly in convincing the London
      group that he was passé.<sup id="notei--14" class="calibre21"><a id="noteifn2" class="calibre22"></a><a class="nounder5" id="notei--16" href="39_split_001.html#noteifn2-r">2</a></sup>
    </div>

    <div class="indent3" id="notei--17">
      3. By this time, as we are told in some detail by his sympathetic biographer Wittke, Weitling had become
      “increasingly psychopathic.” His mentally disturbed condition, or its manifestations at any rate, had begun in
      1843-1844 in jail.<sup id="notei--18" class="calibre21"><a id="noteifn3" class="calibre22"></a><a class="nounder5" id="notei--20" href="39_split_001.html#noteifn3-r">3</a></sup>
    </div>

    <div class="indent3" id="notei--21">
      4. For what it is worth (little), let us record that Weitling was no proletarian, born or otherwise, but had
      begun as a typical guild artisan of the time. Illegitimate son of a French officer and a German maidservant, he
      was apprenticed to a tailor and went through the guild route to become a journeyman and eventually a high-paid
      high-fashion ladies’ tailor, later an independent small tradesman, and, at the end, a small businessman nearing
      bankruptcy.<sup id="notei--22" class="calibre21"><a id="noteifn4" class="calibre22"></a><a class="nounder5" id="notei--24" href="39_split_001.html#noteifn4-r">4</a></sup> Much more important is this: unlike other artisans who became communists,
      Weitling remained utterly alien to the proletarian condition. Biographer Wittke, a staunch anti-Marxist who
      usually has no truck with class analysis, summarizes his outlook as follows: “Weitling wrote with the rage and
      fire of the craftsman, the artisan and the petit bourgeois who were beginning to disintegrate under the impact of
      large-scale industry and were struggling for deliverance from forces that were depressing them into the
      proletariat.” That Weitling’s mentality <em id="notei--25" class="calibre19">feared</em> descent into the abyss of the “unskilled
      city proletariat” is repeated by his biographer in even more detail later.<sup id="notei--26" class="calibre21"><a id="noteifn5" class="calibre22"></a><a class="nounder5" id="notei--28" href="39_split_001.html#noteifn5-r">5</a></sup> In the March 30
      discussion, Marx put it accurately when he attacked his “artisan-communism,” thus differentiating Weitlingism in
      class terms.<sup id="notei--29" class="calibre21"><a id="noteifn6" class="calibre22"></a><a class="nounder5" id="notei--31" href="39_split_001.html#noteifn6-r">6</a></sup>
    </div>

    <div class="indent3" id="notei--32">
      5. At the March 30 meeting it was Weitling who was the best-known intellectual star, not a hapless worker. Though
      now on the decline, he was still an internationally known author, editor, journalist, and lecturer <a id="page_656" class="calibre4"></a>in at least three languages, with almost a decade of fame behind him. Two years before, Marx, a
      brand-new convert to socialism, had praised him as a “proletarian” thinker, for this was indeed how he was widely
      regarded.<sup id="notei--34" class="calibre21"><a id="noteifn7" class="calibre22"></a><a class="nounder5" id="notei--36" href="39_split_001.html#noteifn7-r">7</a></sup> All the “intellectual” advantage was on Weitling’s side—except that now he had
      nothing of interest to say to the movement.
    </div>

    <div class="indent3" id="notei--37">
      It was because of the “proletarian” label that Annenkov was surprised at his appearance: “The tailor-agitator
      Weitling turned out to be a fair-haired, handsome young man [he was over 37], wearing an elegant style of surtout
      and a coquettishly close-cropped beard, looking more like a traveling salesman than the stern and wrathful zealot
      I had presumed I would meet.”<sup id="notei--38" class="calibre21"><a id="noteifn8" class="calibre22"></a><a class="nounder5" id="notei--40" href="39_split_001.html#noteifn8-r">8</a></sup>
    </div>

    <div class="indent3" id="notei--41">
      Engels writes of this meeting in his 1885 article on the history of the Communist League, after giving Weitling
      full marks for his early impulsion to the movement: “But he was no longer the naive young journeyman tailor who,
      astonished at his own talents, was trying to clarify in his own mind just what a communist society would look
      like. He was now the great man, persecuted by the envious on account of his superiority, who scented rivals,
      secret enemies and traps everywhere—the prophet…”<sup id="notei--42" class="calibre21"><a id="noteifn9" class="calibre22"></a><a class="nounder5" id="notei--44" href="39_split_001.html#noteifn9-r">9</a></sup> Evidently Engels did not suspect a mental disorder in the
      clinical sense, even later when he poked fun at Weitling’s “great works (including a new grammar, in which the
      dative case was abolished as an invention of the aristocrats).”<sup id="notei--45" class="calibre21"><a id="noteifn10" class="calibre22"></a><a class="nounder5" id="notei--47" href="39_split_001.html#noteifn10-r">10</a></sup> Weitling’s inventions
      included a theory of the earth as center of the solar system, and other eccentricities.<sup id="notei--48" class="calibre21"><a id="noteifn11" class="calibre22"></a><a class="nounder5" id="notei--50" href="39_split_001.html#noteifn11-r">11</a></sup>
    </div>

    <div class="indent3" id="notei--51">
      The foregoing aspects of the marxological tale are, however, irrelevancies because they do not bear on the real
      point of the March 30 episode precisely from the standpoint of the much-feared Dictatorship of the Intellectuals.
      <em id="notei--52" class="calibre19">Among the protagonists in that discussion there was indeed an advocate of a Dictatorship of
      the Intellectuals in communist society</em> —one who had openly set forth his plan in some detail. It was
      Weitling.
    </div>

    <div class="indent3" id="notei--53">
      This is not controversial. It is not just a question of Weitling’s completely candid advocacy of a messianic
      dictatorship and his consistently ferocious denunciation of democracy and democratic methods. In his writings he
      worked out a blueprint for a hierarchy of learned men, scientists and technicians ruling his communist society
      from the top down in the name of <em id="notei--54" class="calibre19">Intelligenz.</em> “In the first place,” he wrote, “I adopted
      the principle which is admitted as an axiom in the learned world that philosophy must bear rule … What steps
      should be taken … to hand over the direction of the social order to knowledge?” At the apex of public power,
      therefore, he placed a triumvirate of Great <a id="page_657" class="calibre4"></a>Philosopher-Scientists; beneath them, in serried
      ranks, selected by competitive examination, were the lesser lights of learning constituting various assemblies of
      masters, and so on.<sup id="notei--56" class="calibre21"><a id="noteifn12" class="calibre22"></a><a class="nounder5" id="notei--58" href="39_split_001.html#noteifn12-r">12</a></sup> This is the framework of “his intellectual-socialistic state,” as one
      historian has called it.<sup id="notei--59" class="calibre21"><a id="noteifn13" class="calibre22"></a><a class="nounder5" id="notei--61" href="39_split_001.html#noteifn13-r">13</a></sup>
    </div>

    <div class="indent3" id="notei--62">
      Weitling was by no means alone in envisioning hierarchic communisms—virtually all the utopia-makers excelled in
      this department. But not since Plato dreamed of Philosopher-Kings had anyone focused so completely on a vision of
      the future under a Dictatorship of Intellectuals or something like it. This, then, is the champion of the
      proletariat chosen by myth-makers to counter the plot for a Dictatorship of the Intellectuals …
    </div>

    <div class="indent3" id="notei--63">
      This artisan-intellectual was also the representative of a crude sort of anti-intellectualism. The combination is
      not as bizarre as may be supposed.
    </div>

    <div class="indentb1" id="notei--64">
      According to Annenkov’s account, this was what the discussion blew up over.<a id="noteien2-r" class="calibre4"></a><a class="nounder4" id="notei--66" href="43.html#noteien2">*</a> In his first rambling presentation Weitling made a thrust
      against the idea that it was necessary to “think up new economic theories,” implying that only practical
      propaganda work was in order. For all necessary theories and the content of the propaganda had already been
      settled by Weitling’s works. Annenkov reports Marx’s reply as follows:
    </div>

    <div class="bq4" id="notei--67">
      The gist of his sarcastic speech was that to arouse the population without giving it firm and thoroughly reasoned
      out bases for its actions meant simply to deceive it. The stimulation of fantastic hopes that had just been
      mentioned [by Weitling] —Marx observed further on—led only to the ultimate ruin, and not the salvation, of the
      oppressed. Especially in Germany, to appeal to the workers without a rigorous scientific idea and without a
      positive doctrine had the same value as an empty and dishonest game at playing preacher, with someone supposed to
      be an inspired prophet on the one side and only asses listening to him with mouths agape allowed on the other.
    </div>

    <div class="noindenttb1" id="notei--68">
      In Annenkov’s Russia, added Marx, there might still be room for a role <a id="page_658" class="calibre4"></a>like Weitling’s which
      could unite “nonsensical prophets and nonsensical followers.” But—
    </div>

    <div class="bq4" id="notei--70">
      In a civilized country like Germany, Marx continued, developing his idea, people could do nothing without a
      positive doctrine and, in fact, had done nothing up to now except to make noise, cause harmful outbreaks, and
      ruin the very cause they had espoused.<sup id="notei--71" class="calibre21"><a id="noteifn16" class="calibre22"></a><a class="nounder5" id="notei--73" href="39_split_001.html#noteifn16-r">16</a></sup>
    </div>

    <div class="noindenttb1" id="notei--74">
      “The color rose in Weitling’s pale cheeks,” and “in a voice quivering with emotion” he vaunted his achievements
      and boasted of the letters of gratitude he had received from all parts of Germany (the messiah touch), adding
    </div>

    <div class="bq4" id="notei--75">
      that his modest, preparatory work was, perhaps, more important for the general cause than criticism and closet
      analyses of doctrines in seclusion from the suffering world and the miseries of the people. On hearing these last
      words, Marx, at the height of fury, slammed his fist down on the table so hard that the lamp on the table
      reverberated and tottered, and jumping up from his place, said at the same time: “Ignorance has never yet helped
      anybody.”<sup id="notei--76" class="calibre21"><a id="noteifn17" class="calibre22"></a><a class="nounder5" id="notei--78" href="39_split_001.html#noteifn17-r">17</a></sup><a id="noteien3-r" class="calibre4"></a><a class="nounder4" id="notei--80" href="43.html#noteien3">*</a>
    </div>

    <div class="indentt2" id="notei--81">
      If the theoretician of the Dictatorship of Intelligence sneered at the work of theory (criticism and analysis),
      the paradox is not hard to explain. There had to be a division of labor: it was the Prophet’s task to invent the
      theory, and the task of the others to propagandize for it amidst the suffering world. In the future society, the
      Triumvirate of Great Philosophers would not take kindly to unlicensed upstarts who trespassed on their
      prerogative. The Dictatorship of the Intellectuals would brook no intellectual competition.<a id="noteien4-r" class="calibre4"></a><a class="nounder4" id="notei--83" href="43.html#noteien4">**</a>
    </div>

    <div class="indentb1" id="notei--84">
      This same combination of a form of intellectual elitism with a form <a id="page_659" class="calibre4"></a>of anti-intellectualism
      was noted by Engels in a late work, reminiscing about the early Weitlingian artisan-communists of the 1840s in
      French Switzerland. At a time when the true messiah himself was in jail, a “revolutionary” confidence-man named
      Kuhlmann worked the pockets of his supporters.
    </div>

    <div class="bq4" id="notei--86">
      They who were otherwise arch-democrats and extreme equalitarians to the extent of fostering ineradicable
      suspicion against any schoolmaster, journalist, and any man generally who was not a manual worker as being an
      “erudite” who was out to exploit them, let themselves be persuaded by the melodramatically arrayed Kuhlmann that
      in the “new world” it would be the wisest of all, i.e., Kuhlmann who would regulate the distribution of pleasures
      and that therefore, even then, in the old world, the disciples ought to bring pleasures by the bushel to that
      same wisest of all while they themselves had to be content with crumbs.<sup id="notei--87" class="calibre21"><a id="noteifn21" class="calibre22"></a><a class="nounder5" id="notei--89" href="39_split_001.html#noteifn21-r">21</a></sup>

    <div class="noindentt2" id="notei--90">
      In other words: class solidarity consists in letting yourself be exploited not by bourgeois intellectuals but by
      annointed worker-messiahs. This is an example of the “proletarianism” which long masqueraded as leftism, but it
      had nothing to do with Marx’s proletarian socialism.
