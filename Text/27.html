    MOVEMENT</strong></h2>

    <div class="indent" id="ch18--3">
      The preceding chapter has already paid considerable attention to the role of intellectuals not merely in society
      at large but also inside the socialist and working-class movement. Now we turn to some specific problems under
      the latter head, and to some specific cases.
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="ch18--4">
      One important overall feature of the attitude taken by Marx and Engels is that it requires a “fight on two
      fronts” at almost every point, that is, the rejection of bisymmetrical mistakes. If, on the one hand, some in the
      movement welcomed intellectuals uncritically and without a sifting scrutiny, there was the opposite error of
      others who proposed an exclusionary policy with or without a theory of “proletarianism” (<em id="ch18--5" class="calibre8">ouvriérisme</em>). There was a constant tendency for vivid appreciation of the dangers of one course to
      bring about sympathy for the opposite mistake, in a familiar pattern.
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="ch18--6">
      Marx recognized that there was a positive role for intellectuals in the movement, but that it had to be a limited
      one.<sup id="ch18--7" class="calibre13"><a id="ch18en1-r" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch18--9" href="43.html#ch18en1">*</a></sup>
      Both sides of this view are to be traced through the following sections.
    </div>

    <h3 class="h2" id="ch18lev1">1. THE POSITIVE ROLE</h3>

    <div class="indent" id="ch18--11">
      If Marx’s mistrust of intellectuals who approached the movement made it clear that he was not inclined to
      exaggerate their virtues, he was <a id="page_540" class="calibre6"></a>nevertheless far from blind to the needs they could fill.
      We have seen this in connection with “exceptional cases” in general.
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="ch18--13">
      The positive role of intellectuals for the socialist movement may be conveniently divided into three aspects: one
      distinctive of the earliest days of the movement, a second becoming prominent as the movement grew, and a third
      that looked toward the socialist future. Though there is the usual overlap, these three roles did not necessarily
      involve the same people or the same kind of people.
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="ch18--14">
      1. <em id="ch18--15" class="calibre8">Ideological innovators and initiators.</em> This was the frequent role of the most important
      figures in the early days of the movement, but, as we have already discussed, this involved extraordinary
      individuals for the most part, not class strata. Where socialism began as an ideological innovation, whether by
      an educated bourgeois or an educated worker, the next historical problem was always the <em id="ch18--16" class="calibre8">fusion</em> of the socialist idea with a real working-class movement that was groping its way to
      consciousness. This, and not the mode of innovation, was the crucial pass: what happened at this point was more
      important than whether the idea originally came from a bourgeois or a proletarian cranium.
    </div>

    <div class="indenttb" id="ch18--17">
      Young Engels grasped this problem before his association with Marx, in fact immediately after coming to England,
      and he set it forth in his early work on <em id="ch18--18" class="calibre8">The Condition of the Working Class in England.</em> At
      this point “socialism” meant Owenism, a mixed-class group around a bourgeois innovator; but alongside it was a
      class movement of the proletariat organized in the Chartist movement (which, to be sure, also had its
      middle-class reform wing).
    </div>

    <div class="bq" id="ch18--19">
      In its present form, Socialism [Owenism] can never become the common possession of the working class; it must
      even condescend to return for a moment to the Chartist standpoint. But true proletarian socialism, having passed
      through Chartism and been purified of its bourgeois elements—as is true of how it has already developed in the
      case of many socialists and many Chartists, who are nearly all socialists—will indeed assume, within a short
      time, an important role in the history of the development of the English people….
    </div>

    <div class="bqi" id="ch18--20">
      We see, therefore, that the workers’ movement is divided into two sections, the Chartists and the Socialists. The
      Chartists are <a id="page_541" class="calibre6"></a>the most backward, the least developed, but in exchange they are genuine
      proletarians in the flesh, the representatives of the proletariat. The Socialists are more far-seeing, proposing
      practical measures against distress, but they come originally from the bourgeoisie and for this reason are
      incapable of amalgamating with the working class. The fusion of Socialism with Chartism, the reproduction of
      French Communism in an English manner, will be the next step, and has partly already begun. Only when this has
      been brought about will the working class really be the ruler of England …<sup id="ch18--22" class="calibre13"><a id="ch18fn2" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch18--24" href="39_split_001.html#ch18fn2-r">2</a></sup>
    </div>

    <div class="indenttb" id="ch18--25">
      Quite complete here is the general conception of the fusion of socialist ideas (with or without the ideologists)
      and the proletarian movement. When he looked back to this period from the vantage point of 1871, Engels’ picture
      was naturally a bit different. He told an Italian comrade that his situation in Naples was much like that of the
      early German movement twenty-five years before:
    </div>

    <div class="bq" id="ch18--26">
      At that time we had only a few men among the proletariat in Switzerland, France and England [as well as Germany]
      who were imbued with socialist and communist ideas, we had few means of working among the masses, and like you we
      had to find supporters among the schoolmasters, journalists and students. Fortunately, in this period of the
      movement such men, who did not exactly belong to the working class, were easily found; later, when the
      workingpeople dominated the movement as a mass, they certainly became rare.<sup id="ch18--27" class="calibre13"><a id="ch18fn3" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch18--29" href="39_split_001.html#ch18fn3-r">3</a></sup>
    </div>

    <div class="noindentt" id="ch18--30">
      This was written soon after the fall of the Paris Commune, and for a whole dark period socialism was not exactly
      swamped by an influx of educated, or uneducated, bourgeois recruits.
    </div>

    <div class="indentb" id="ch18--31">
      When the movement got going again, there was a great deal of variation from country to country. One of the
      contrasts was between the largely proletarian character of the German movement and the relatively nonproletarian
      makeup of the socialist revival in England in the 1880s which began with Hyndman’s Democratic (later Social
      Democratic) Federation. In 1883 Engels wrote to Bebel:
    </div>

    <div class="bq" id="ch18--32">
      … in the last period there emerged out of the bourgeoisie a large number of young heads who—to the shame of the
      English workers it must be said—grasp things better and take them up more ardently than do the workers. For even
      in the Democratic Federation the workers mostly accept the new program only <a id="page_542" class="calibre6"></a>reluctantly and
      outwardly…. Don’t for anything in the world be taken in by the claim there is a really proletarian movement going
      on here. I know Liebknecht would like to make himself and everyone else believe this, but it is not the case. The
      elements now active can become important, now that they have accepted our theoretical program and thus acquired a
      basis-, but only in case a spontaneous movement breaks out here among the workers and they succeed in getting
      control of it. Till then they will remain individual heads, behind whom there is only a hodgepodge of confused
      sects, remnants of the great movement of the ’40s, and nothing more.<sup id="ch18--34" class="calibre13"><a id="ch18fn4" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch18--36" href="39_split_001.html#ch18fn4-r">4</a></sup>
    </div>

    <div class="indenttb" id="ch18--37">
      The root of the difference lay in the favored economic position of England, of its working class as well as its
      bourgeoisie, as Engels explained more than once. He thought the turn of industrial depression was reducing this
      difference, and indeed by the end of the decade it did. In 1884 Engels wrote Bebel that this was “the secret of …
      the present sudden emergence of a socialist movement here” in England:
    </div>

    <div class="bq" id="ch18--38">
      Till now the organized workers—trade unions—have still remained quite remote from it; the movement is going on
      among “educated” elements derived from the bourgeoisie, who here and there seek contact with the masses and in
      places find it. These elements are of very varying value morally and intellectually, and it will take some time
      before they sort themselves out and things become clarified. But it will hardly go altogether back to sleep
      again.<sup id="ch18--39" class="calibre13"><a id="ch18fn5" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch18--41" href="39_split_001.html#ch18fn5-r">5</a></sup>
    </div>

    <div class="indentt" id="ch18--42">
      2. <em id="ch18--43" class="calibre8">Ideological services to an ongoing movement.</em> This was the main problem, and as such we
      have kept it in the forefront up to now; it need not be further discussed at this point. However, it must be
      understood that the recruitment of intellectuals was only one type of solution; the other was the training and
      outfitting of workers to take over these posts and responsibilities, the most important of which were not the
      literary ones, such as editing, but party leadership and parliamentary representation.
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="ch18--44">
      The talents of educated recruits were in sore demand especially as the movement grew. Socialist periodicals
      multiplied, but could a competent editor be made on the spot out of a worker without experience? On the other
      hand, how readily could a revolutionary proletarian propagandist and publicist be made out of an <em id="ch18--45" class="calibre8">Ex-Studiosus?</em>
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="ch18--46">
      3. <em id="ch18--47" class="calibre8">Intellectual labor for a socialist society.</em> We have already seen this <a id="page_543" class="calibre6"></a>need emphasized, especially in connection with students:<sup id="ch18--49" class="calibre13"><a id="ch18fn6" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch18--51" href="39_split_001.html#ch18fn6-r">6</a></sup> specialists, technicians, and
      scientific talents in the productive work of society.
    </div>

    <div class="indentb" id="ch18--52">
      Far from seeing socialist society as overrun with intellectuals, Engels thought the big problem at the beginning
      would be the lack of intellectual laborers capable of shucking their bourgeois training and working loyally for a
      workers’ state. In the letter already quoted to a correspondent who implied that the mass of people were too
      lacking in reasoning ability to lead society,<sup id="ch18--53" class="calibre13"><a id="ch18fn7" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch18--55" href="39_split_001.html#ch18fn7-r">7</a></sup> Engels asserted his belief that the organized workers had already
      shown they were more competent to carry on their own affairs than bourgeois elements. But what if the educated
      bourgeois refuse to lend their talents to build a socialist society, or even try to stab it in the back?
    </div>

    <div class="bq" id="ch18--56">
      To be sure, we still lack technicians, agronomists, engineers, chemists, architects, etc., but if worse comes to
      worst we can buy these just as well as the capitalists do; and if a stern example is made of a few traitors—which
      are sure to crop up among this lot—then they will find it in their own interest to stop robbing us. But outside
      of such specialists, among whom I also count the schoolteachers, we can get along very well without the rest of
      the “educated people” …<sup id="ch18--57" class="calibre13"><a id="ch18fn8" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch18--59" href="39_split_001.html#ch18fn8-r">8</a></sup>
    </div>

    <div class="indenttb" id="ch18--60">
      Note that the intellectual laborers with whom Engels is concerned here are not the ideological manipulators but
      those whose work is closely related to the production of material wealth, for he is thinking especially of the
      first struggles of socialist society to win the economic battle for survival. The same concern is evident in two
      letters to Bebel, which say much the same thing in somewhat different ways. The first takes off from an
      apparently unrelated question, his hope that there will be no war for the following reason:
    </div>

    <div class="bqi" id="ch18--61">
      In order to take over the ownership and operation of the means of production, we need people who have been
      technically trained, and in mass numbers at that. These we don’t have; till now we have even been rather glad
      that we have been largely spared the “educated” people.
    </div>

    <div class="noindentb" id="ch18--62">
      This is an interesting statement; it is followed by Engels’ typical optimism about the self-healing powers of the
      movement:
    </div>

    <div class="bq" id="ch18--63">
      Now it’s different. Now we are strong enough to be able to stand any quantity of educated Quarcks and digest
      them; and I foresee that in the next 8-10 years we will recruit enough young technical <a id="page_544" class="calibre6"></a>people, physicians, lawyers and schoolmasters to have the factories and big estates administered
      for the nation by party comrades. Then, therefore, our entry into power will be quite natural and will come off
      smoothly—relatively speaking. On the other hand, if we come to the helm prematurely, the technical people will be
      our main enemies, and they will deceive and betray us wherever they can; we will have to use terror against them,
      and still get done in anyway. That is what <em id="ch18--65" class="calibre8">constantly</em> happened on a small scale to the
      French revolutionaries: even in routine administration they had to leave the subordinate posts where the real
      work was done in the hands of the old reactionaries, and the latter obstructed and crippled everything. That is
      why I hope and desire that our splendid and sure development which is advancing with the calm and inescapability
      of a natural process will remain on its natural lines.<sup id="ch18--66" class="calibre13"><a id="ch18fn9" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch18--68" href="39_split_001.html#ch18fn9-r">9</a></sup>
    </div>

    <div class="noindenttb" id="ch18--69">
      And a couple of weeks later, after Bebel’s encouraging reply:
    </div>

    <div class="bqi" id="ch18--70">
      I am glad to hear that there is so much of a trend in our direction already in force among the technically
      educated circles at present. However, in 1848 and 1870-71 I had too many nice experiences with the French
      republicans—who indeed were even bourgeois, showing how far one gets with such followers and sympathizers who
      keep quiet in time of danger, and how horribly one can compromise oneself—not to wish that, for such an important
      business as the socialization of big industry and big agriculture, we should still have a few years’ more time to
      give the gentlemen a closer inspection in advance as to their ability and character. That would not only avoid
      friction; in a critical moment it might also avert an otherwise inevitable decisive defeat. Otherwise there will
      be colossal blunders en masse; that is indeed inevitable. In fact you yourself say that among the bids enough are
      from people who have more things they want from us than they have talent or knowledge; and I haven’t forgotten
      what Singer told me the nun said of the students who were being driven into the Social Democracy out of fear of
      the examinations. Yet the fact is, <em id="ch18--71" class="calibre8">they are coming</em>, a token of what is in the
      offing.<sup id="ch18--72" class="calibre13"><a id="ch18fn10" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch18--74" href="39_split_001.html#ch18fn10-r">10</a></sup>
    </div>

    <div class="indenttb" id="ch18--75">
      Confidence that “they are coming”—that socialist society would get an adequate supply of “brain workers” or
      “educated proletariat”—was expressed in the party press by an article of E. Bernstein’s to which Engels gave
      considerable praise. This article saw them coming from two <a id="page_545" class="calibre6"></a>sources, eventually if not
      immediately: a technically trained stratum of government employees formed especially by Bismarck’s statification
      measures; and the “overproduction” of brain workers (“chemists, architects, engineers of all kinds, accountants,
      etc.”) who were being spewed out of the educational institutions into unsuitable jobs at low salary—“in short, an
      educated proletariat, an army of starveling ‘intellectuals,’ is in existence and grows from day to day, people
      whose lot is in no wise more enviable than that of the ‘ordinary’ wage-worker.” These elements are seen as
      playing a necessary but auxiliary role; above all, it is clear that a leadership role in politics or in the party
      is not reserved for such an “educated proletariat,” let alone for the bourgeois <em id="ch18--77" class="calibre8">Intelligenzen</em>.<sup id="ch18--78" class="calibre13"><a id="ch18fn11" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch18--80" href="39_split_001.html#ch18fn11-r">11</a></sup>
    </div>

    <h3 class="h2" id="ch18lev2">2. ANTI-INTELLECTUALISM AND EXCLUSIONISM</h3>

    <div class="indent" id="ch18--82">
      A critical attitude toward, or political mistrust of, bourgeois intellectual elements is not
      “anti-intellectualism,” just as intellectual integrity is not defined as the integrity of intellectuals.
      Anti-intellectualism is another sprawling term that it would be unprofitable to pin down, but for practical
      purposes we mean hostility to theory and theoretical work, to education as such, to the cultural heritage of the
      past, to the need for serious study, and similar backward hostilities.
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="ch18--83">
      Such anti-intellectualist tendencies were far from rare in the early socialist movement, and not unknown later;
      they cropped up often enough to draw Marx’s denunciation and scorn. It is hardly necessary to document Marx’s
      insistence on the need for theoretical development, education (especially inside the movement), and the
      absorption of the best of society’s learning and culture as the legacy to be taken over by socialist
      society.<a id="ch18en2-r" class="calibre6"></a><a class="nounder1" id="ch18--85" href="43.html#ch18en2">*</a> But a look at some of
      the concrete issues leads to a more important problem: the exclusionary tendency.
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="ch18--86">
      <a id="page_546" class="calibre6"></a>Marx had to go through no developmental change on the question of “proletarian”
      anti-intellectualism. We have seen that from the beginning, as a new-fledged socialist, he was struck with
      admiration for the spirit he encountered in the Paris workers’ clubs of the 1840s: “the studiousness, the craving
      for knowledge,” and their “unceasing urge for development” and thirst for education, all of which testified to
      the “nobility” of the movement.<sup id="ch18--88" class="calibre13"><a id="ch18fn13" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch18--90" href="39_split_001.html#ch18fn13-r">13</a></sup> It is indeed an important fact, too often overlooked in historical accounts,
      that the organized socialist movement had a far-ranging cultural-educational impact on the workers who joined it,
      culminating in the production of what later came to be called “worker-intellectuals,” meaning workers who
      developed their literary and other intellectual skills to the point where they could carry out tasks thought
      peculiar to bourgeois educated elements. We have noted the pride with which Marx in 1850 introduced an article
      written for his magazine by a working tailor (who was later to become secretary of the International): before the
      proletariat wins on the barricades, he wrote, “it announces the coming of its rule by a series of intellectual
      victories.”<sup id="ch18--91" class="calibre13"><a id="ch18fn14" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch18--93" href="39_split_001.html#ch18fn14-r">14</a></sup>
    </div>

    <div class="indentb" id="ch18--94">
      In sharp contrast was another type not uncommon in the Paris of 1850. That year, discussing the Blanquist-type
      conspiratorialists who infested the movement, Marx noted that they
    </div>

    <div class="bq" id="ch18--95">
      look with deepest disdain on a more theoretical clarification of the workers as to their class interests. Hence
      their irritation—which is not proletarian but plebeian—at the <em id="ch18--96" class="calibre8">habits noirs</em> [frock coats],
      the more or less educated people who represent this side of the movement, people from whom, as the official
      representatives of the party, they can never make themselves entirely independent.<sup id="ch18--97" class="calibre13"><a id="ch18fn15" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch18--99" href="39_split_001.html#ch18fn15-r">15</a></sup>
    </div>

    <div class="noindentt" id="ch18--100">
      These left-Jacobin types scorned theory—that is, the development of the workers’ movement on the basis of ideas
      as well as struggle—because they viewed “action” (in practice, putsches) as a substitute for theory. A resolute
      band needed only a minimum of primitive ideas in order to carry out futile gestures; but a movement of the class
      could mature <a id="page_547" class="calibre6"></a>only on the basis of an overall view of social change, that is, of theory.
    </div>

    <div class="indentb" id="ch18--102">
      Among the German artisan-communist elements Marx more often encountered a different kind of anti-intellectual
      primitivism: a know-nothing denunciation of educated people or intellectual laborers as such, accompanied by
      self-preening as “professional proletarians.” This type of narrow mentality Marx and Engels associated with the
      <em id="ch18--103" class="calibre8">Straubinger</em> and the <em id="ch18--104" class="calibre8">Knote</em>—two words that occur very often in
      their correspondence in this connection.<a id="ch18en3-r" class="calibre6"></a><a class="nounder1" id="ch18--106" href="43.html#ch18en3">*</a> They are shorthand labels, as in this typical remark of Marx’s, writing about a Chartist
      meeting held in 1856 on the anniversary of the 1848 revolution:

      … the German bumpkin <em id="ch18--108" class="calibre8">Scherzer</em> (°old boy°) came forward and in truly awful <em id="ch18--109" class="calibre8">Straubinger</em> style denounced the German “men of learning” [<em id="ch18--110" class="calibre8">Gelehrten</em>],
      the “intellectual workers” who had left them (the bumpkins) in the lurch and thus forced them to make fools of
      themselves in front of the other nations.<sup id="ch18--111" class="calibre13"><a id="ch18fn17" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch18--113" href="39_split_001.html#ch18fn17-r">17</a></sup>
    </div>

    <div class="noindentt" id="ch18--114">
      Marx had only scorn for the kind of “professional proletarian” (real or alleged) who exhibited horny hands (real
      or alleged) as proof of political superiority and moral purity. This tactic, incidentally, was mainly directed to
      naive intellectuals engaged in Going to the People or in slumming; it was not calculated to impress other
      workers.
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="ch18--115">
      The same pattern, elevated from an individual’s ploy to a sect’s theory, became the <em id="ch18--116" class="calibre8">ouvriérisme</em> characteristic especially of parts of the later syndicalist movement. This
      “proletarianism,” a basically mystical doctrine ascribing virtue only to certified proletarians, was the other
      side of the medal to intellectualism, if the latter is taken to mean a one-sided glorification of

      In some cases, both sides of this picture can be seen fading into each other, like a lap-dissolve in the movies.
      Since the crux of intellectualism is its one-sidedness, Marx was mistrustful not only of bourgeois intellectuals
      but of the sort of ex-worker who emulated their vices. A case in point was Johann Most, who had a much-publicized
      career first as a <a id="page_548" class="calibre6"></a>muddlehead in the German movement and later as an anarchist in America. A
      bookbinder turned writer and editor,<sup id="ch18--119" class="calibre13"><a id="ch18en4-r" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch18--121" href="43.html#ch18en4">*</a></sup> Most was in 1877 the most vociferous Social-Democratic supporter of Professor
      Eugen Dühring, an academic who aspired to become the leading theoretician both of socialism and anti-Semitism. It
      was Most who organized the effort to have the party press stop publishing Engels’ articles against Dühring, later
      collected into a book.<sup id="ch18--122" class="calibre13"><a id="ch18fn19" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch18--124" href="39_split_001.html#ch18fn19-r">19</a></sup> Engels’ demolition of Dühringism was especially resented by the party’s Berlin
      intelligentsia, then a small factor; Most carried more weight. A month before Most’s interdiction attempt, Marx
      had commented on Most’s attitude: “if Herr Most has not understood that much can be learned from Engels’ positive
      elucidations not only by ordinary workers, but even by ex-workers like himself who imagine they can get to know
      and pass judgment on everything in a twinkling, but also by people who are really scientifically educated, then I
      feel sorry for his powers of judgment.”<sup id="ch18--125" class="calibre13"><a id="ch18fn20" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch18--127" href="39_split_001.html#ch18fn20-r">20</a></sup> The campaign by Most and the Berlin intellectuals to gag Engels’ articles
      on Dühring failed, but not without causing some turmoil in the party. In the autumn of that year Marx wrote a
      friend (in the same letter that dealt with the “superwise doctors” of the Höchberg group):
    </div>

    <div class="bqi" id="ch18--128">
      Workers themselves, when they give up working, like Herr Most &amp; Co., and become <em id="ch18--129" class="calibre8">literati

      muddleheads from the allegedly “learned” caste.<sup id="ch18--130" class="calibre13"><a id="ch18fn21" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch18--132" href="39_split_001.html#ch18fn21-r">21</a></sup>

    <div class="noindentt" id="ch18--133">
      Cases naturally had to be judged on their merits, not on the class credentials of an individual.
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="ch18--134">
      A more important case in point, the most talented <em id="ch18--135" class="calibre8">Straubinger</em> of all, was Wilhelm
      Weitling. As we have seen, the maturity of the young Marx can almost be measured by the advance in his
      understanding of what Weitling represented, from his initial enthusiasm of 1844 to his confrontation with him in
      1846. It was one day in 1846 that Weitling’s scorn of theoretical analysis caused Marx to strike the table and
      cry: “Ignorance has never yet helped anybody.” The target of this anger was <a id="page_549" class="calibre6"></a>not merely
      Weitling but the <em id="ch18--137" class="calibre8">Straubinger</em> type of artisan-radicalism in general.<a id="ch18en5-r" class="calibre6"></a><a class="nounder1" id="ch18--139" href="43.html#ch18en5">*</a>
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="ch18--140">
      The German artisan-communists who were organized in London as the League of the Just also faced a confrontation
      between the old <em id="ch18--141" class="calibre8">Straubinger</em> radicalism of Weitling and the new proletarian communism
      being developed by Marx. By 1847, not only had Weitling himself departed but the decisive leadership—Karl
      Schapper at its head—had opted for Marx. Still, when the newly named Communist League held its first congress in
      the summer of that year, there was still a rearguard seeking to hang on to the old narrow ideas.
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="ch18--142">
      A typical pattern resulted. Here were two bourgeois-educated newcomers of high intellectual attainment, Marx and
      Engels, who were proposing a new orientation; and although the League’s own leaders were sponsoring them, they
      were vulnerable to <em id="ch18--143" class="calibre8">Straubinger</em> prejudices. One of the members, Friedrich Lessner, who had
      himself been originally radicalized by reading Weitling, later recalled that “the opponents of Marx raised the
      cry of ‘down with the “intellectuals,” ’ not only at the first congress, but all through the intervening period
      to November,” and even at the second congress of November-December where Marx and Engels were assigned to write
      the Manifesto.<sup id="ch18--144" class="calibre13"><a id="ch18fn22" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch18--146" href="39_split_001.html#ch18fn22-r">22</a></sup> This cry did not get very far here, where it rang as an echo of the past; but
      it still had a flourishing future in every nook and cranny of the working-class movement that was still in
      process of clarification and maturation.
    </div>

    <div class="indentb" id="ch18--147">
      Some significant cases affecting Marx are considered in the following sections; but another typical case may be
      mentioned here, as seen through Engels’ eyes. In 1881 Engels characterized as follows the French socialist group
      represented by the paper <em id="ch18--148" class="calibre8">Le Prolétaire</em>, which was in process of forming the
      social-reformist movement (“Possibilists”) opposed to the Marxist party:
    </div>

    <div class="bqi" id="ch18--149">
      <em id="ch18--150" class="calibre8">Le Prolétaire</em> was the paper put out by the very narrowest-minded clique among all the
      Paris workers who liked to write. It had a rule that only real manual workers could collaborate with advice or by
      writing for it. The most thickheaded Weitlingite kind of hatred against “men of learning” [<em id="ch18--151" class="calibre8">Gelehrten</em>, i.e., university-educated people] was on the order of the day. Therefore this paper
      was also absolutely empty of content, but it claimed to be the purest expression of the Paris
      proletariat.<sup id="ch18--152" class="calibre13"><a id="ch18fn23" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch18--154" href="39_split_001.html#ch18fn23-r">23</a></sup>
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="ch18--155">
      <a id="page_550" class="calibre6"></a>In this case, as in many others, a form of “proletarianism” was institutionalized by an
      exclusionary policy: in the best cases, as a way of keeping workers uncontaminated by bourgeois influences—a
      quite futile way; in the worst cases, as a means of keeping control of a group or movement in the hands of a
      “proletarian” coterie, which then utilized its control of this little section of the class to become its broker
      in accommodations with the bourgeois state and society. This is one reason why a façade of “proletarianism” often
      constituted a store front for merchandising quite ordinary social-reformism.
    </div>

    <h3 class="h2" id="ch18lev3">3. THE CASE OF THE WILLICH-SCHAPPER GROUP</h3>

    <div class="indent" id="ch18--158">
      The pattern exemplified by the “Down with the intellectuals” sentiment at the first congress of the Communist
      League in 1847 was repeated in that organization following the 1848-1849 defeat of the revolution; but whereas it
      was unsuccessful when the movement was on the upswing, it flowered as part of the process of disintegration. The
      new impulsion was similar to the old, and recurred in the socialist movement hundreds of times in the next
      hundred years: in an internal fight over policy and ideas, one faction claims that its own proletarian
      composition (real or alleged) guarantees its political correctness or purity, and denounces the nonproletarian
      composition of its opponent faction (real or alleged) all the more enthusiastically in proportion to its
      inability to refute its arguments.
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="ch18--159">
      In the Communist League, of course, since Marx and Engels were the outstanding nonproletarians, anyone who
      disliked their ideas had this brittle weapon to hand. In 1850 in the backwash of defeat and disappointment,
      Schapper—the key figure in the old leadership who had been instrumental in aligning it with Marx in 1847—reverted
      to the “old crap” (to use a favorite nontechnical term of Marx’s). This veteran of the movement, six years older
      than Marx, had been an active radical since his student days seventeen years before; son of a poor rural parson,
      he had gone through high school to the University of Giessen, studying forestry. After helping to organize a
      conspiratorial putsch by the nationalist-democratic movement, after a jail sentence, and after involvement in
      bourgeois-republican revolutionism, he became a traveling <a id="page_551" class="calibre6"></a>professional revolutionary. As
      such, he worked at odd jobs to earn a living till he became a skilled typesetter. This ex-student, turned
      peripatetic organizer, advanced from the ideology of Young Germany and Mazzini to the artisan-communism of
      Weitling, the socialist utopianism of Cabet, and the left-Jacobinism of the Babouvist-Blanquist type of
      conspiratorial sects that arose between the revolutions of 1830 and 1848.<sup id="ch18--161" class="calibre13"><a id="ch18fn24" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch18--163" href="39_split_001.html#ch18fn24-r">24</a></sup>
    </div>

    <div class="indentb" id="ch18--164">
      Except for Schapper’s beginnings as a university student, this course of development was typical of the artisan
      membership of the groups that he was active in organizing, particularly the League of the Just, which changed its
      name to Communist League in June 1847 under Marx’s influence. Of this type, Schapper was one of the best. When
      young Engels met him and his comrades Joseph Moll and Heinrich Bauer, they were already experienced
      revolutionists. Four decades later, old Engels paid them homage in an essay on the history of the Communist
      League: “They were the first revolutionary proletarians whom I met … I shall never forget the deep impression
      that these three real men made upon me, who was then still only wanting to become a man.”<sup id="ch18--165" class="calibre13"><a id="ch18fn25" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch18--167" href="39_split_001.html#ch18fn25-r">25</a></sup> Further
      on in this essay Engels puts the matter of the League’s social composition less lyrically and more precisely: the
      members of the League, he explained, were “almost exclusively artisans.”<sup id="ch18--168" class="calibre13"><a id="ch18fn26" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch18--170" href="39_split_001.html#ch18fn26-r">26</a></sup>
    </div>

    <div class="bq" id="ch18--171">
      The greatest honor is due to them, in that they, who were themselves not yet full proletarians but only an
      appendage of the petty-bourgeoisie, an appendage which was passing into the modern proletariat but which did not
      yet stand in direct opposition to the bourgeoisie, that is, to big capital—in that these artisans were capable of
      instinctively anticipating their future development and of constituting themselves, even if not yet with full
      consciousness, the party of the proletariat.<sup id="ch18--172" class="calibre13"><a id="ch18fn27" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch18--174" href="39_split_001.html#ch18fn27-r">27</a></sup>
    </div>

    <div class="noindentt" id="ch18--175">
      This is what had separated them from an unreconstructed <em id="ch18--176" class="calibre8">Straubinger</em> like Weitling, whose
      personal background was very similar to theirs but who had evolved in a different direction.
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="ch18--177">
      “But,” Engels continued, “it was also inevitable that their old handicraft prejudices should be a stumbling-block
      to them at every moment …” Although, unlike Weitling, they sought to identify themselves with the modern
      proletariat, their notion of what this meant was as vague as the term was amorphous. When Schapper wrote the
      leading <a id="page_552" class="calibre6"></a>article for the League’s <em id="ch18--179" class="calibre8">Kommunistische Zeitschrift</em> in
      September 1847 (having already met Engels but not Marx), he defined the proletariat in the old sense of the
      propertyless, and specified: “Proletarians in present-day society are all who cannot live on their capital: the
      worker as well as the man of learning, the artist as well as the small bourgeois …”<sup id="ch18--180" class="calibre13"><a id="ch18fn28" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch18--182" href="39_split_001.html#ch18fn28-r">28</a></sup>
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="ch18--183">
      The past to which Schapper reverted in 1850 was that of the putschist Jacobinism of the old bourgeois-republican
      movement, and indeed for the next few years he allied himself with the pink Democracy. This collapse to the right
      was initially presented with a brave roar which sounds to our modern ears as ultraleftist: as the Communist
      League split in September 1850 Schapper supported the group that insisted the revolution was still around the
      corner and that an insurrection must be hothouse-forced. As we have seen, Marx vigorously opposed this
      course.<sup id="ch18--184" class="calibre13"><a id="ch18fn29" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch18--186" href="39_split_001.html#ch18fn29-r">29</a></sup>
    </div>

    <div class="indentb" id="ch18--187">
      In this situation Schapper picked up the blunt instrument of “proletarianism” as a handy argument-substitute. At
      the meeting of the Central Committee on September 15, the ex-student strove to paint the dispute as one between
      the “proletariat” (meaning his own supporters among the worker-artisans of the group) and “the people who
      represent the party on the theoretical side”; or between “those who work with the pen” and “those who work in
      other ways.”<sup id="ch18--188" class="calibre13"><a id="ch18fn30" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch18--190" href="39_split_001.html#ch18fn30-r">30</a></sup> We will see in a moment the reason for this strange dichotomy: writers and
      nonwriters, of all things. The extant minutes do not record that Schapper at this meeting explicitly advocated
      limiting membership to workers. Shortly thereafter, the Cologne committee of the League (which had now become the
      Central Committee following the split) criticized the documents it had received from Schapper’s group:
    </div>

    <div class="bq" id="ch18--191">
      … the attempt to expel the Majority [Marx’s supporters] of the central committee was based … partly on the
      general principle that the League should expel all writers. It was argued that the League was exclusively
      intended for factory workers and artisans and that if these groups only had the will they would be able to seize
      the reins of power as soon as revolution should break out again and so would be able to carry out the communist
      reorganization of society without further ado.<sup id="ch18--192" class="calibre13"><a id="ch18fn31" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch18--194" href="39_split_001.html#ch18fn31-r">31</a></sup>
    </div>

    <div class="indentt" id="ch18--195">
      This emphasis on getting rid of <em id="ch18--196" class="calibre8">writers</em> rather than nonworkers in general had a reason.
      We have not yet mentioned the inspiritor of the Willich-Schapper group: August von Willich, who had kept silent
      during <a id="page_553" class="calibre6"></a>the September 15 debate and let Schapper do the talking. Schapper, at least, had long
      made his livelihood as a journeyman and was quite at home in the workers’ milieu. Willich was quite another
      matter—though no one could accuse him of being a writer or having any proclivities “on the theoretical side.”
      This new recruit to communism was a military martinet who had fought with the rebels in the 1849 uprising and had
      then moved left. Sprung from an old aristocratic family, he had been a Prussian career officer before his recent
      radicalization, after which he had converted to an artisanal occupation (carpenter) like his predecessors.<a id="ch18en6-r" class="calibre6"></a><a class="nounder1" id="ch18--199" href="43.html#ch18en6">*</a> It would have been difficult for
      him to pass himself off as a proletarian or reasonable facsimile thereof.
    </div>

    <div class="indentb" id="ch18--200">
      The Willich-Schapper group, therefore, could make only gingerly use of its appeal to <em id="ch18--201" class="calibre8">Straubinger</em> prejudices; but it could be more scornful of the people “on the theoretical side”
      who appealed to theory as well as practical sense to oppose the idea of instant-revolutionism. The Cologne
      committee’s statement included also a contrast between the Willich-Schapper form of anti-intellectualism and
      Marx’s viewpoint:
    </div>

    <div class="bq" id="ch18--202">
      According to the Manifesto and the Address [to the Communist League, of March], the course of development of the
      proletarian movement goes as follows: the proletariat, once having come to consciousness of its own class
      situation, absorbs into this situation all the educational elements of the old society, and thus attains an
      understanding in theoretical terms of the lines of development of a communist revolution [and then proceeds to
      practice] … In contrast, this new-old standpoint [of Willich-Schapper] declares all theoretical work to be
      settled, sets itself in hostile contradiction to all writing activity, and thinks it can realize the end-goal of
      the movement on the basis of the present-day development, in particular, of a new German revolution. So it is
      consequently quite natural that these same people, who apparently represent the interests of the “pure
      proletariat” so exclusively, trumpet forth the bare phrase <em id="ch18--203" class="calibre8">revolution</em> in their latest
      proclamation sent out into the world in the name of a “democratic-socialist committee” in partnership with
      Frenchmen, Poles and Hungarians and present themselves as the champions of the <a id="page_554" class="calibre6"></a><em id="ch18--205" class="calibre8">petty-bourgeois</em> social-democratic republic. In this way, then, the proletariat … is once again
      summoned into battle in the interests of another class …<sup id="ch18--206" class="calibre13"><a id="ch18fn33" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch18--208" href="39_split_001.html#ch18fn33-r">33</a></sup>
    </div>

    <div class="indentt" id="ch18--209">
      The group’s scorn of theoretical work was useful in its subsequent career: these self-proclaimed champions of the
      proletariat against writers and theoreticians shortly entered into close collaboration with the petty-bourgeois
      Democracy in emigration, the same elements who had been denounced in Marx’s and Engels’ “Address to the Communist
      League” in March 1850—but not until they had written various fire-breathing putschist-conspiratorial documents
      which were a godsend to the Prussian government’s prosecution of the Communists in Cologne and provided much of
      the ammunition for it in the show-trial of 1852.<sup id="ch18--210" class="calibre13"><a id="ch18fn34" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch18--212" href="39_split_001.html#ch18fn34-r">34</a></sup>
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="ch18--213">
      By this time it was clear in practice that this group’s seemingly ultraleftist stance, with its demand for
      instant revolution, was only the other side of the coin of simple opportunism, with its usual get-rich-quick
      calculations, and that the former had transformed itself into the latter without difficulty. Marx—fulfilling his
      function on the theoretical side—had already pointed this very pattern out in so many words in the September 15,
      1850, debate. There he showed in advance that the actual politics of the revolution-mongers was, in fact,
      opportunistic: German-patriotic rather than internationalist, and “social-democratic” rather than
      proletarian-communist. They were using the term <em id="ch18--214" class="calibre8">proletariat</em> merely ritualistically. “To
      make this phrase effective,” Marx said, “it was necessary to describe the petty-bourgeois as proletarians so that
      in practice it was the petty-bourgeois and not the proletarians who were represented. The actual revolutionary
      process had to be replaced by revolutionary catchwords.”<sup id="ch18--215" class="calibre13"><a id="ch18fn35" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch18--217" href="39_split_001.html#ch18fn35-r">35</a></sup> (This same substitution had been made by Schapper

    <div class="indent" id="ch18--219">
      In practice it turned out that the <em id="ch18--220" class="calibre8">Straubinger</em> who wanted to use “proletarianism” as an
      exclusionary principle became a wing of the petty-bourgeois Democracy, where they functioned as brokers between
      their own “proletarian” clientele and the middle-class Democrats. The connection was not fortuitous: an
      independent proletarian movement can afford to admit a leavening of educated recruits breaking from the bourgeois
      world, but “proletarian” brokers, approaching an alien class movement for a deal, like to have pure merchandise
      to sell.

    <h3 class="h2" id="ch18lev4"><a id="page_555" class="calibre15"></a>4. EXCLUSIONISM IN THE FIRST INTERNATIONAL</h3>

    <div class="indent" id="ch18--223">
      A proposal for the exclusion of nonworkers from membership or leadership of the movement came up later in the
      International, with several similarities to the Willich-Schapper case. It came from the Proudhonists, who
      dominated the French section of the International. Since they had been, with the British trade-unionists, the
      initiatory force in 1864, this was a very serious problem which could not simply be voted out of existence by the
      General Council.
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="ch18--224">
      Here was the pattern: the advocacy of exclusionism came from that national current in the International which
      most systematically represented the old petty-bourgeois radicalism of the artisan stratum, the French <em id="ch18--225" class="calibre8">Straubinger;</em> while the staunchest opposition to exclusionism came from the representatives of
      the British trade unions, which constituted by far the most proletarian part of the movement.
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="ch18--226">
      From the beginning Marx was naturally aware of the danger that the new organization might be swamped by
      intellectual radicals without any class commitment. As we have seen, for him the absolute test was not the social
      origin of an individual but rather the overall social composition of the organization. There was consensus in the
      International on the test for nonworker individuals: personal life-commitment to the working-class movement
      without careerist motivation. With this approach, a sprinkling of recruits from the educated classes could be a
      help, although the flooding of the organization with intellectual elements would be a disaster calling in
      question the class character of the movement. It was a question of a qualitative change due to an overdose, like
      the amount of pepper in soup or the proportion of arsenic in a medical compound.
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="ch18--227">
      In the General Council, the first question along these lines concerned the “honorable member” category for
      notables, a custom that saddled the rolls of workers’ organizations with bourgeois radicals who were willing to
      accept homage but not responsibility and to give their names but no loyalty. Louis Blanc had made a bid to become
      such an Hon. Member of the new International. Marx wrote to Engels: “Surmising that an attempt of this sort would
      be made, I had however already put through the by-law, fortunately, that no one (outside of workers’ <em id="ch18--228" class="calibre8">societies</em>) was to be <em id="ch18--229" class="calibre8">invited</em>, and that no person could be an <em id="ch18--230" class="calibre8">honorary member.”</em><sup id="ch18--231" class="calibre13"><a id="ch18fn36" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch18--233" href="39_split_001.html#ch18fn36-r">36</a></sup> At the same time, as he discusses in the same letter, he <a id="page_556" class="calibre6"></a>worked closely with people of bourgeois origin (like Fox and Lefort<sup id="ch18--235" class="calibre13"><a id="ch18fn37" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch18--237" href="39_split_001.html#ch18fn37-r">37</a></sup>) who were scarcely as
      socialistic as Louis Blanc but who had entered into the work of the International as responsible and loyal
      members and committed activists. On this issue, too, the test was not simply individual ideology but personal
      commitment to the class movement.
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="ch18--238">
      Hence the pattern of the fight on two fronts. If Louis Blanc had to be kept at arm’s length, people like Lefort
      had to be allowed to contribute their loyal service. Lefort was a radical-republican reformer oriented to
      parliamentary democracy, no revolutionary, but he had played a useful part in founding the International and was
      sincerely devoted to building it. However, the working-class membership of the French section followed the
      Proudhonist leadership of Tolain; and the Proudhonists decided there was room in France only for their own
      tendency. They could not Proudhonize the whole International but they could make it a Proudhonist sect in their
      own country. To this end they presented the General Council with an ultimatum: Lefort, who was the
      International’s press agent in Paris, had to be dismissed.<sup id="ch18--239" class="calibre13"><a id="ch18fn38" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch18--241" href="39_split_001.html#ch18fn38-r">38</a></sup> Thus the Proudhonists adopted the policy of
      exclusionism, at least from posts, in order to ensure their own monopoly of ideas and control in the
      organization.
    </div>

    <div class="indentb" id="ch18--242">
      This presented Marx and the General Council with a dilemma. Marx had been initially impressed quite favorably
      with Tolain in spite of his ideology, especially because he had recently run as an independent working-class
      candidate.<sup id="ch18--243" class="calibre13"><a id="ch18fn39" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch18--245" href="39_split_001.html#ch18fn39-r">39</a></sup> On their part the Proudhonists had no criticism of Marx’s functioning in the
      affairs of the International.<a id="ch18en7-r" class="calibre6"></a><a class="nounder1" id="ch18--247" href="43.html#ch18en7">*</a>
      <a id="page_557" class="calibre6"></a>There was no tension in this area. The conflict was over the presence of the French
      republicans in the International, with Lefort the crux. The Proudhonists’ ultimatum was: <em id="ch18--249" class="calibre8">him
      or us.</em> Reluctantly Marx had to conclude that the Proudhonist sectists could not be persuaded to utilize
      Lefort’s talents rather than demand his head, and that the General Council had no practical alternative to
      sacrificing Lefort in order to appease them and preserve the movement. When the French row started, Marx summed
      it up for Engels as follows:
    </div>

    <div class="bq" id="ch18--250">
      … it seems to me that this time both sides do each other an injustice … There is the following added
      circumstance:The workers [of the French section] seem to be set on <em id="ch18--251" class="calibre8">excluding</em> every
      °literary man,° which however is nonsense, since they need them in the press, but it is excusable in view of the
      continual betrayal by °literary men.° On the other side, the latter are suspicious of <em id="ch18--252" class="calibre8">every
      workers’ movement</em> which behaves in a way contrary to them.…
    </div>

    <div class="bqi" id="ch18--253">
      So then: in Paris too there are, on the one side, <em id="ch18--254" class="calibre8">Lefort</em> (a literary man, well-to-do in
      addition, therefore “a bourgeois,” but a man of purest reputation and, as far as La Belle France is concerned,
      the real founder of our society) and, on the other, <em id="ch18--255" class="calibre8">Tolain, Fribourg, Limousin</em>, etc., who
      are workers. Well, I will let you know the outcome.<sup id="ch18--256" class="calibre13"><a id="ch18fn40" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch18--258" href="39_split_001.html#ch18fn40-r">40</a></sup>
    </div>

    <div class="noindentt" id="ch18--259">
      In a memorandum Marx jotted down the two motivations for the choice that had to be made: “<em id="ch18--260" class="calibre8">International character of the Society is endangered”</em> (if the Proudhonists pulled out), since
      the lack of a French section at this point would mean there was no large Continental contingent to balance the
      British presence; and “<em id="ch18--261" class="calibre8">The class character of the movement.</em>”<sup id="ch18--262" class="calibre13"><a id="ch18fn41" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch18--264" href="39_split_001.html#ch18fn41-r">41</a></sup> True, the class character
      of the Proudhonist group was similar to that of the old Communist League, that is, based largely on artisanal
      workers (though without the proletarian-communist orientation of people like Schapper, Moll and H. Bauer); Tolain
      and Fribourg were engravers; but the International’s hope was that through these workers it could reach other
      strata.
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="ch18--265">
      The outcome came quickly as, in the following two weeks, the General Council was subjected to a round of quarrels
      between Tolain and Fribourg (who had come over from Paris to press their case) and Lefort.<sup id="ch18--266" class="calibre13"><a id="ch18fn42" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch18--268" href="39_split_001.html#ch18fn42-r">42</a></sup> While
      the General Council, following Marx’s lead, agreed to remove Lefort from the Paris post, it rejected the
      Proudhonist concept involved, stating “that it does not sanction the principle that none but an ouvrier [worker]
      is admissible as an official in our Society.”<sup id="ch18--269" class="calibre13"><a id="ch18fn43" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch18--271" href="39_split_001.html#ch18fn43-r">43</a></sup>
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="ch18--272">
      <a id="page_558" class="calibre6"></a>When the first congress of the International took place in Geneva in 1866, Tolain went to
      bat for his exclusionist principle, this time formulated as a motion to restrict congress delegates to manual
      workers. He argued that the class struggle made it “useful, even indispensable, that all men who have the duty of
      representing working-class groups should be workers.”<sup id="ch18--274" class="calibre13"><a id="ch18fn44" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch18--276" href="39_split_001.html#ch18fn44-r">44</a></sup> In classic fashion, he struck an ultraleftist pose as he
      argued that “under present conditions, we have to consider as opponents all members of the privileged classes,
      privileged either by virtue of capital or a diploma.” Then he appealed to the principle of self-emancipation: the
      working class “wants to achieve its own salvation itself, without anyone’s protection. It is therefore necessary
      that its delegates belong neither to the liberal professions nor to the caste of capitalists.”<sup id="ch18--277" class="calibre13"><a id="ch18fn45" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch18--279" href="39_split_001.html#ch18fn45-r">45</a></sup> The
      point of this leftist phraseology is that it came from a reformist whom even the Bonapartist government
      considered fairly respectable, and whose rapid rightward development in the next few years provided a special
      commentary on the rhetoric.
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="ch18--280">
      Two leading British trade-union delegates answered him, apparently stirred especially by his statement that
      anyone with a degree was an enemy. In refutation both pointed to the man whose role in the International had not
      been impugned by anyone, least of all by the Proudhonists: namely, Dr. Karl Marx.<a id="ch18en8-r" class="calibre6"></a><a class="nounder1" id="ch18--282" href="43.html#ch18en8">*</a> Cremer, of the carpenters and joiners, began by stating
      that the nonmanual workers on the General Council were above suspicion: “far from it, it is likely that without
      their devotion, the Association would not have been able to establish itself in England so thoroughly. Among
      those members I will mention one only, Citizen Marx, who has devoted all his life to the triumph of the working
      classes.”<sup id="ch18--283" class="calibre13"><a id="ch18fn46" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch18--285" href="39_split_001.html#ch18fn46-r">46</a></sup>
    </div>

    <div class="indentb" id="ch18--286">
      James Carter, of the perfumers, made two points important in this connection:
    </div>

    <div class="bqi" id="ch18--287">
      Citizen Karl Marx has just been mentioned; he has perfectly understood the importance of this first congress,
      where there <a id="page_559" class="calibre6"></a>should be only working-class delegates; therefore he refused the delegateship he
      was offered in the General Council. But this is not the reason to prevent him or anyone else from coming into our
      midst; on the contrary, men who devote themselves completely to the proletarian cause are too rare for us to push
      them aside. The middle class only triumphed when, rich and powerful as it was in numbers, it allied itself with
      men of science …<sup id="ch18--289" class="calibre13"><a id="ch18fn47" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch18--291" href="39_split_001.html#ch18fn47-r">47</a></sup>
    </div>

    <div class="noindentt" id="ch18--292">
      Tolain then utilized Carter’s argument to co-opt Marx for his own side of the debate: “As a worker, I thank
      Citizen Marx for not accepting the delegateship offered him. In doing that, Citizen Marx showed that workers’
      congresses should be made up only of manual workers.”<sup id="ch18--293" class="calibre13"><a id="ch18fn48" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch18--295" href="39_split_001.html#ch18fn48-r">48</a></sup>
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="ch18--296">
      Of course, Citizen Marx had no such position, nor had Carter said so. Marx had several reasons for not wishing to
      go to Geneva as a delegate—mainly his work on <em id="ch18--297" class="calibre8">Capital</em>, and, very likely, his distaste for
      sterile debates like those forced on the congress by the Proudhonists—but he may also have told the General
      Council that he preferred them to send trade-unionist delegates to this first congress; we do not know.<sup id="ch18--298" class="calibre13"><a id="ch18fn49" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch18--300" href="39_split_001.html#ch18fn49-r">49</a></sup>

      The congress defeated Tolain’s motion, but it gained twenty votes against twenty-five.
    </div>

    <div class="indentb" id="ch18--302">
      Later Marx learned about another aspect of Tolain’s motivation, one which seems to have been confirmed by events.
      He told Engels that the General Council’s secretary for France
    </div>

    <div class="bq" id="ch18--303">
      has given me the key to Tolain’s and Fribourg<sup id="ch18--304" class="calibre13">?</sup>s operation. They want to come out in
      1869 as <em id="ch18--305" class="calibre8">workers'</em> candidates to the Corps Législatif, on the “principle” that <em id="ch18--306" class="calibre8">only workers</em> can represent workers. It was therefore extremely important for the gentlemen to
      have this principle proclaimed by the congress [of the International].<sup id="ch18--307" class="calibre13"><a id="ch18fn50" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch18--309" href="39_split_001.html#ch18fn50-r">50</a></sup>
    </div>

    <div class="noindentt" id="ch18--310">
      Tolain did succeed in getting himself elected as the candidate of the Paris workers; and it was as deputy that he
      voted in the Versailles assembly to support the massacre of the Paris Commune, that is, of his constituents. Like
      other advocates of exclusionism, he used an artificial “proletarianism” as a device to establish himself as
      broker for the working class, broker to the bourgeoisie.
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="ch18--311">
      The counterposition of views can be put this way. Tolain and his similars utilized “proletarianism” as a
      touchstone for individuals, since their aim was to substitute a particular individual as the plenipotentiary for
      the class—an individual who, holding the proxy power given him by his clientele, could thereby become influential
      in the really important <a id="page_560" class="calibre6"></a>circles, that is, the circles that really ruled in society. Thus
      Tolain was quite sincere in primping himself as the “representative of the workers” in the Versailles assembly of
      the counterrevolution, that is, as the assembly’s proletarian broker, while the real leaders of the workers were
      fighting with the Commune. In this view, “self-emancipation” meant that the workers relied for “protection” (as
      Tolain had put it) not on the bourgeoisie and not on the state but on an honest-to-goodness worker like himself,
      who “protected” his clientele by pleading with the bourgeoisie and the state to do them justice.
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="ch18--313">
      In contrast, for Marx the crux was the predominantly proletarian nature of the <em id="ch18--314" class="calibre8">movement</em>
      in practice, that is, in composition, leadership, etc.; and if this were ensured, then it could safely use the
      services of committed intellectual laborers, in limited numbers.

    <h3 class="h2" id="ch18lev5">5. THE ISSUE OF CLASS COMPOSITION</h3>

    <div class="indentb" id="ch18--316">
      In the letter last quoted, Marx discussed another point that arose in the General Council right after the Geneva
      congress:
    </div>

    <div class="bqi" id="ch18--317">
      As a demonstration against the Messrs’ Frenchmen—who wanted to exclude everybody except “manual workers,” first
      from membership in the International, then at least from eligibility to be elected delegate to the congress—the
      Englishmen yesterday proposed <em id="ch18--318" class="calibre8">me</em> as president of the General Council. I declared I could
      not undertake the thing under <em id="ch18--319" class="calibre8">any</em> circumstances, and for my part proposed <em id="ch18--320" class="calibre8">Odger</em>, who was thereupon re-elected, although some voted for me in spite of my
      declaration.<sup id="ch18--321" class="calibre13"><a id="ch18fn51" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch18--323" href="39_split_001.html#ch18fn51-r">51</a></sup>
    </div>

    <div class="noindentt" id="ch18--324">
      Marx did not refuse because of some general principle that a “brain worker” should be debarred from filling the
      post. He did, however, feel that there was a question of symbolizing or signaling what the International aspired
      to be, by the selection of a workers’ leader to what was going to be a largely symbolic position anyway. (A year
      later the presidency was abolished unanimously, on Marx’s initiative.)<sup id="ch18--325" class="calibre13"><a id="ch18fn52" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch18--327" href="39_split_001.html#ch18fn52-r">52</a></sup> The Council minutes
      reported more ambiguously: “He, Marx, thought himself incapacitated [not debarred] because he was a head worker
      and not a hand worker.”<sup id="ch18--328" class="calibre13"><a id="ch18fn53" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch18--330" href="39_split_001.html#ch18fn53-r">53</a></sup> Behind Marx’s refusal were also a couple of other <a id="page_561" class="calibre6"></a>considerations. Perhaps dominant was his desire to devote himself as much as possible to finishing
      <em id="ch18--332" class="calibre8">Capital;</em> and his election to the presidency would have set him up as the target and
      whipping-boy for all the ambitious champions of “proletarianism” inside and outside the International.<a id="ch18en9-r" class="calibre6"></a><a class="nounder1" id="ch18--334" href="43.html#ch18en9">*</a>

    <div class="indent" id="ch18--335">
      There could be only one president; but since there were many members on the General Council, their election posed
      a question similar to the admission of members: the question of proportion, or overdose. Marx stated this
      explicitly when a physician named Sexton was proposed. One of the Council members wondered “whether it was
      desirable to add professional men to the Council …” The minutes record Marx’s opinion, not on Sexton but on the
      principle raised: “Citizen <em id="ch18--336" class="calibre8">Marx</em> did not think there was anything to fear from the
      admission of professional men while the great majority of the Council was composed of workers …”<sup id="ch18--337" class="calibre13"><a id="ch18fn57" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch18--339" href="39_split_001.html#ch18fn57-r">57</a></sup>
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="ch18--340">
      The problem of balance in social composition—proportion of <a id="page_562" class="calibre6"></a>workers to nonworkers or brain
      workers—was naturally more important for membership in general and the makeup of the branches in particular. The
      question was not a hard one as far as the major European countries were concerned, since from the outset the
      branches and sections were overwhelmingly working-class in England, France, Belgium, Switzerland and Germany. It
      was the United States that precipitated the issue in 1872, with the antics of the notorious Section 12, dominated
      by Victoria Woodhull, who was then going through her short-lived radical and feminist phase.
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="ch18--342">
      The problem was not only that Section 12 was the hearth of every exotic ism and crackpot fad then popular—with
      its socialism, as well as its feminism, figuring uneasily in this company—and not only that its membership was
      overwhelmingly if not exclusively middle-class, professional and intellectual; but, into the bargain, it also
      publicly repudiated even lip-service to the International’s program of proletarian socialism.<a id="ch18en10-r" class="calibre6"></a><a class="nounder1" id="ch18--344" href="43.html#ch18en10">*</a> It was not a borderline case but
      a provocation. Working-class elements in the American sections, especially Section 1, considered Section 12 a
      discreditment and an embarrassment to the organization. For the first time, issue was taken over whether the
      International should be working-class in character, and over what exactly this meant in terms of concrete
      regulations.
    </div>

    <div class="indentb" id="ch18--345">
      As a result of the Section 12 problem, the General Council adopted guidelines written by Marx, establishing a
      maximum percentage for nonworkers:
    </div>

    <div class="bqi" id="ch18--346">
      Considering, that the I.W.A. … is to consist exclusively of “working men’s societies” …
    </div>

    <div class="bqi" id="ch18--347">
      that, consequently … [the rule that] “Everybody who acknowledges and defends the principles of the I.W.A. is
      eligible <a id="page_563" class="calibre6"></a>to become a member,” although it confers upon the active adherents of the
      International who are no working men the right either of individual membership or of admission to working men’s
      sections, does in no way legitimate the foundation of sections exclusively or principally composed of members not
      belonging to the working class;
    </div>

    <div class="bqi" id="ch18--349">
      that for this very reason the General Council was some months ago precluded from recognising a Slavonian section
      exclusively composed of students;
    </div>

    <div class="bqi" id="ch18--350">
      that … the General Rules and Regulations are to be adapted “to local circumstances of each country”;
    </div>

    <div class="bqi" id="ch18--351">
      that the social conditions of the United States, though in many respects most favourable to the success of the
      working-class movement, peculiarly facilitate the intrusion into the International of bogus reformers,
      middle-class quacks and trading politicians;

      For these reasons the General Council recommends that in future there be admitted no new American section of

    </div>

    <div class="indentt" id="ch18--356">
      The choice of the fraction two-thirds was, of course, arbitrary; the intent was to maintain the proletarian
      proportion above a mere majority and definitely less than 100 percent (which would mean exclusionism). The
      one-third allowance for non-wage-workers left plenty of room for exceptional cases—the exceptional cases of
      bourgeois adherents who had genuinely come over to the standpoint of the proletarian movement, as distinct from
      the Woodhull types. A motivation that Marx stressed at two Council meetings was that the International must not
      be used locally, or anywhere, as a steppingstone to parliamentary careers by ambitious individuals.<sup id="ch18--357" class="calibre13"><a id="ch18fn61" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch18--359" href="39_split_001.html#ch18fn61-r">61</a></sup>

    <div class="indent" id="ch18--360">
      The guidelines written for the American problem applied to any “new American section.” Four months later, July
      1872, in preparation for the Hague Congress, the by-laws were amended to make the two-thirds rule applicable to
      all sections. Marx added: “for special conditions, such as they exist in Poland and in other countries, special
      clauses may be made.”<sup id="ch18--361" class="calibre13"><a id="ch18fn62" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch18--363" href="39_split_001.html#ch18fn62-r">62</a></sup>

      Thus, under the pressure of dealing with the American faddists, institutional form was given to Marx’s view that,

      In 1873, in his book <em id="ch18--369" class="calibre8">Statism and Anarchy</em>, Bakunin made a then-routine charge which has
      become a marxological favorite. Anyone who reads the socialist polemics of the time in any bulk soon discovers
      that virtually everyone gets around to accusing virtually everyone else of seeking to exploit the workers,
      establish a dictatorship or despotism, embezzling, and other peccadillos; and the charges are often true all
      around in one particular or another. Even so, few rivaled Bakunin in the insouciance with which he scattered

      In the case of Bakunin’s 1873 book, Marx made a notebook summary (apparently with a view to writing an attack on

      Dictatorship of the Intelligentsia is himself free of this detestable ambition. On the contrary; such a

      barricade-fodder that was to lead the troops. While the revolutionary masses were to be warned of the
      bureaucratic dangers of organization and kept free of such sins, the leaders were to be organized in secret
      societies of relatively small membership:
    </div>

    <div class="bq" id="ch18--401">
      These societies [wrote Bakunin] were to be limited to a small number of persons, but would include, as far as

    <div class="indentb" id="ch18--412">

      In line with this, the pamphlet also pointed to the social composition of the Bakuninist operation, especially in
      Italy:
    </div>

    <div class="bq" id="ch18--419">
      All the alleged sections of the Italian International are led by lawyers without cases, doctors without patients

      In 1870 a published piece by Bakunin drew one of his imaginary pictures of the intellectual hordes following him.
      Engels commented in a letter to Marx:
    </div>

    <div class="bqi" id="ch18--429">
      Bakunin’s letter [to the editor] is really very naive. What a misfortune for the world it would be—if it were not
      an awful lie—that there were 40,000 revolutionary students in Russia without a proletariat or even merely a
      revolutionary peasant behind them, and without any career ahead of them other than the dilemma of Siberia or
      emigration to Western Europe. If anything could ruin the Western European movement, it would be the importation
      of these 40,000 ± [more or less] educated, ambitious, hungry Russian nihilists; nothing but officer-cadets
      without an army, which we are to supply for them; a nice prospect—that to bring unity to the European proletariat
      it must be put under Russian command! Nevertheless, however much B[akunin] may be exaggerating, it still is
      crystal-clear that the danger is there. “Holy Russia” will spew out a certain number of these Russians “without
      careers” every year, and under the pretext of <em id="ch18--430" class="calibre8">principe international</em>, they will
      everywhere insinuate themselves into positions as leaders, bring into the sections [of the International] <a id="page_568" class="calibre6"></a>their private intrigues which are inevitable among Russians, and then the General Council will
      have its work cut out for it.<sup id="ch18--432" class="calibre13"><a id="ch18fn74" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch18--434" href="39_split_001.html#ch18fn74-r">74</a></sup>
    </div>

    <div class="noindentt" id="ch18--435">
      Seven years later, this “nice prospect” seemed to be looming in one place, Italy, as the conspiratorial sect of
      Bakuninists—not forty thousand, but “a band of young lawyers, doctors [academics], literati, clerks, etc., under
      Bakunin’s personal command”—seized control wherever revolutionary workers started to become active. So Engels
      reported in an article. But when the movement reached the industrial north, the more advanced workers did not
      “let themselves be long held in tutelage by those broken-down young bourgeois, who had thrown themselves into
      socialism because (in Bakunin’s words) they found themselves in a ‘blind-alley career.’” The proletariat would
      not stay under the control of “people who derive their vocation as leaders of the workers’ movement from their
      situation as seedy bourgeois.”<sup id="ch18--436" class="calibre13"><a id="ch18fn75" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch18--438" href="39_split_001.html#ch18fn75-r">75</a></sup>

      This picture of the social composition of the Bakuninist movement, although phrased pejoratively, corresponded to
      the aims of Bakunin himself.

    <div class="indent" id="ch18--440">
      At the same time that Bakunin looked to the dictatorship of his band of lumpen-intellectuals, he matched the

      of the same coin. The troops (barricade-fodder) were not to be contaminated by exposure to confusing ideas, if
      they were to remain pristinely fierce enough to hack the old society to pieces in accordance with the call to
      Pandestruction; nor were they to be overeducated to the point where they might question the General Staff, those
      “unseen pilots” who were wielding the lumpen-army in order to remold the world closer to their heart’s desire.
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="ch18--444">
      As early as 1847, when Marx was busy giving lectures to the German workers’ club in Brussels, Bakunin wrote that
      Marx was “ruining the workers by making theorists of them.”<sup id="ch18--445" class="calibre13"><a id="ch18fn77" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch18--447" href="39_split_001.html#ch18fn77-r">77</a></sup> While Bakunin often represented himself as a
      theoretician, he also urged: “Let us leave to others the task of developing the theoretical principles of social
      revolution and content ourselves with applying them, with incorporating them into acts.”<sup id="ch18--448" class="calibre13"><a id="ch18fn78" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch18--450" href="39_split_001.html#ch18fn78-r">78</a></sup> There
      was no real contradiction: the development of theoretical principles was his own province, and the henchmen
      should content themselves with applying them in action.

      The International pamphlet by Engels, Lafargue and Marx took care <a id="page_569" class="calibre6"></a>to bring out this aspect

    <div class="noindentt" id="ch18--457">
      As against this view, Marx preached the necessity for revolutionaries to absorb the best of the attainments of
      bourgeois and past societies and integrate it into the education of the proletarian movement. The International
      pamphlet contemptuously quoted the principle laid down by the anarchist duo:
    </div>

    <div class="bqi" id="ch18--458">
      A revolutionary [wrote Bakunin and Nechayev] scorns all doctrinairism and renounces the science of this world,

      other hand: no truckling to intellectuals in the movement.

    <div class="indentb" id="ch18--469">
      We have seen that Marx’s and Engels’ views emerged as the problem flared up in the German party in waves. One of
      the first signs was the <a id="page_570" class="calibre6"></a>accession of some intellectuals after the 1875 unification, and one
      of the first flareups was signalized by the Höchberg “manifesto” of 1879. Already, even though there were as yet
      few Höchberg-type elements in the party, Marx and Engels were filled with apprehension:
    </div>

    <div class="bq" id="ch18--471">
      In general [wrote Engels], it’s about time we came out against the philanthropic big bourgeois and
      petty-bourgeois, students and doctors [academics] who are pushing their way into the party and want to water down

      The still-small intellectualist wing in the party had reacted to Bismarck’s Anti-Socialist Law by calling for a
      retreat to the right. But Bismarck’s persecution drove the working-class ranks to the left. The danger seemed to
      diminish; yet in early 1883 Engels still lamented: “Oh this damned German flabbiness of thought and will, which
      was brought with so much effort into the party along with the ‘eddicated,’ if only we were rid of it
      again!”<sup id="ch18--476" class="calibre13"><a id="ch18fn83" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch18--478" href="39_split_001.html#ch18fn83-r">83</a></sup> The following year the problem became more serious as the result of an
      electoral victory by the Social-Democracy. (Typically, the “men of ideas” are attracted by a display of political
      muscle.) Between the first and second ballots of the election, Engels kept his fingers crossed about the quality
      of the Social-Democratic candidates being elected: “The worst ones (the eddicated ones) have already been
      elected; those yet to come [in the second balloting] are mostly workers, and they can only improve the
      company.”<sup id="ch18--479" class="calibre13"><a id="ch18fn84" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch18--481" href="39_split_001.html#ch18fn84-r">84</a></sup>

      In this first decade after Marx’s death, Engels redoubled his private warnings to the Bebel leadership of the

      people in bourgeois positions.”

      But precisely in Germany [he wrote to Bebel] these are the most dangerous people, and Marx and I have fought them

      everywhere, they have to be kept down without a letup, since their petty-bourgeois standpoint is every moment in

      “As sure as anything, the split is coming” with these elements, he predicted, not for the first time. “My

      When in 1890 the government bowed to increased socialist strength and scrapped its Anti-Socialist Law, the
      problem naturally deepened as another bar to careerists was removed. Engels had new cause to warn that “the

      When Engels died five years later, the influence of intellectuals in the upper circles of the party was still
      mounting. Soon after his death, one of those he had considered an exception, Eduard Bernstein, came out with his
      relapse to the Höchberg-reformism of his early days, giving it the new brand-name of Revisionism. The fresh young
      <em id="ch18--504" class="calibre8">Studiosen</em> and university-certified <em id="ch18--505" class="calibre8">Doktoren</em> were encouraged to

      point in discussion at the Dresden party congress of 1903, the repeated letters of Marx and Engels to the German
      party leaders were still potent. At the 1903 congress, it was Bebel and <a id="page_572" class="calibre6"></a>Kautsky in
      particular<sup id="ch18--508" class="calibre13"><a id="ch18fn89" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch18--510" href="39_split_001.html#ch18fn89-r">89</a></sup> who tried to articulate Marx’s approach, an approach that had been
      energetically drummed into them. Bebel told the delegates:

      After the developments of the last few years, I have, alas, come around to the following opinion in my old age:
      Scrutinize every party comrade, but in the case of an academic or an intellectual, scrutinize him two or three
      times. (<em id="ch18--512" class="calibre8">Stormy applause.</em>)

      We need the intelligence of the academics and intellectuals. Their fortunate circumstances and social position
      have allowed them to bring to bear scientific capacities which permit them to be active for our party in
      outstanding fashion, if they behave honorably and uprightly in accord with the party. But there is where the
      danger also lies, on the other hand.… precisely as academics, as men and women with greater knowledge and, in a
      certain sense, also with greater intellect and deeper insight, they damn-well have the obligation in everything
      they do to make doubly and triply sure they are on the correct road, and to find out from the proletarians how
      the masses of people think, how they feel, and what they want—masses who know better than academics what the
      struggle of the proletariat is all about.<sup id="ch18--515" class="calibre13"><a id="ch18fn90" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch18--517" href="39_split_001.html#ch18fn90-r">90</a></sup>

      It should not be thought that the intellectuals were the villains of the piece, in the process of
      deradicalization and bourgeoisification that led the Social-Democracy down the road to its political breakdown in
      1914. The decisive motive forces came rather from the hardening bureaucracies of the trade unions and party
      institutions and their interaction with the bourgeois state. This combination was a mighty power. But the
      intellectuals typically represented the servants of power, not the power of intellect.
