    HOW NOT TO QUOTE MARX</h2>

    <div class="indent" id="foreword--3">
      The Foreword to Volume 1 took up a number of overall problems faced by any attempt to present Marx’s views,
      particularly by an attempt at “a full and definitive treatment” of Marx’s political thought. One of these
      problems can be usefully discussed again from another angle, taking inspiration from an article by Engels called
      “How Not to Translate Marx.”
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="foreword--4">
      I explained why this work has taken the route of presenting a large number of passages from Marx and Engels
      themselves, instead of merely offering the hundred-and-nth “interpretation” of their views, and I contrasted this
      method with “quotation-mongering.” Of course, quotation-mongering, being a pejorative, means any kind of quoting
      you don’t like; but instead of pinning a definition to the mat, I offer a more positive contribution. What are
      the booby traps to look for in quoting from Marx and Engels?
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="foreword--5">
      The answer naturally applies in generalized form to anyone else. But nothing compares with marxology as the
      natural habitat of tendentious quotation. Ronald L. Meek put it mildly when he wrote: “All too often, writers
      seem to assume that when dealing with Marx it is permissible to relax academic standards to a degree which they
      themselves would regard as quite illegitimate if they were dealing with any other economist.”<sup id="foreword--6" class="calibre13"><a id="forewordfn1" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="foreword--8" href="39_split_000.html#forewordfn1-r">1</a></sup> As usual, the main problem is not dishonesty. To be sure, there is a minor
      sector of the field, the gutter school of marxology, where anything goes; but this need not concern us here.
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="foreword--9">
      The main problem is what I would call, if pressed to invent a pseudoscientific nomenclature, Marxolalia. (Better,
      Marxophasia; but I prefer the sound of the first.) It may be defined as the propensity to garble Marx. The victim
      of this disorder cannot reproduce Marx’s <a id="page_2" class="calibre6"></a>thought in a form that Marx would recognize. Of the
      many causes of this disorder, I want to concentrate on one that is remediable.
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="foreword--11">
      There are few writers or thinkers in history whose every word and grunt has been examined by hostile critics so
      minutely as Marx’s has. This is quite in order, provided that the words and grunts are evaluated with ordinary
      common sense and decency. Marx came into the world to challenge all the established authorities, governmental
      authorities and intellectual authorities, and he can hardly complain if the authorities react with some
      hostility. They seize on the useful fact that every scrap of his correspondence has been published somewhere;
      unpublished as well as published manuscripts have been exhumed and reprinted; unfinished fragments have been
      solemnly published and annotated; workbooks and notes have been scoured; scraps of paper have been fished out of
      wastebaskets, as it were, and given to the world; volumes of real and alleged conversations have been put into
      circulation.
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="foreword--12">
      It may seem unnecessary to point out that all this material exists on several levels of reliability, and
      investigators who want to be trusted must always ask themselves what exactly they are quoting from. Yet hundreds
      of times, over and over, I have seen remarks by Marx that were hastily dashed off in a letter to a friend, or a
      few words jotted down in a note, solemnly quoted (without identification) as if they were long-pondered
      programmatic statements every syllable of which had been thought out for its exact scientific meaning—indeed,
      even without regard to other statements on the subject of greater reliability. I wonder how many figures would
      come through such a working-over, done with a view to discreditment. In any case, several dozen “interpretations”
      of Marx can be fabricated, with little difficulty, through proper exegesis of the proper “quotations” thus
      wrenched off; and this has been going on industriously for a hundred years.
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="foreword--13">
      I repeat that I am not referring to garden-variety types of disingenuous or out-of-context quoting, but to a more
      elusive sort of Marxolalia. Thus, one sentence quoted from Marx’s <em id="foreword--14" class="calibre8">Grundrisse</em> (economic
      workbooks) is just as quotable as any other sentence, isn’t it? But the so-called <em id="foreword--15" class="calibre8">Grundrisse</em> is a peculiar nonbook: it consists of notebooks kept by Marx with no thought of
      publication—notes and jottings toward the eventual writing of a work on political economy. Each sentence
      represents a thought that popped into Marx’s mind at the time—unreviewed, unrevised, uncriticized, often
      ungrammatical, and sometimes undecipherable. If it turned out to be badly formulated, <a id="page_3" class="calibre6"></a>Marx had
      no obligation to add a footnote to the notes for the guidance of future sharpshooters. Not only that: these
      thoughts and notes were often scribbled late at night and when Marx was suffering from carbuncles,
      gastrointestinal illness, headaches, and assorted dyspepsias. Everyone knows Marx’s jocular remark, on finishing
      <em id="foreword--17" class="calibre8">Capital</em>, that “I hope the bourgeoisie will remember my carbuncles all the rest of
      their lives,”<sup id="foreword--18" class="calibre13"><a id="forewordfn2" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="foreword--20" href="39_split_000.html#forewordfn2-r">2</a></sup> but quoters should remember them too.
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="foreword--21">
      I have just taken an important work as example, but all kinds of quoting operations are undertaken also on the
      most ephemeral sources.
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="foreword--22">
      Let us consider this systematically, by drawing up a list of the types of writings and documents by Marx or
      Engels that are used for quoting or quotation-mongering, in descending order of reliability. At the top of the
      list are naturally:
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="foreword--23">
      1. Books and major essays that were published under the control of the writer, with the usual opportunity for
      correction, revision, etc. (Most of Marx’s or Engels’ major works will come to mind as examples.)
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="foreword--24">
      2. Articles published under the control of the writer.
    </div>

    <div class="alpha-list" id="foreword--25">
      a. Articles composed as political statements, for a political audience, and signed; in short, intended for the
      purpose they are used for.
    </div>

    <div class="alpha-list" id="foreword--26">
      b. Articles in which remarks on issues occur only in passing, often elliptically.
    </div>

    <div class="alpha-list" id="foreword--27">
      c. Journalistic articles, written as hack work, perhaps not even signed.
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="foreword--28">
      3. Articles published not under the control of the writer. Perhaps the most extreme case is that of <em id="foreword--29" class="calibre8">New York Tribune</em> articles that were rewritten or added to at will by the editors.
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="foreword--30">
      4. Unpublished manuscripts.
    </div>

    <div class="alpha-list" id="foreword--31">
      a. Unfinished or fragmentary, often never reviewed or revised—unfinished for various possible reasons, including
      dissatisfaction with the work.
    </div>

    <div class="alpha-list" id="foreword--32">
      b. Finished—but unpublished for various possible reasons, including dissatisfaction.
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="foreword--33">
      5. Letters. The circumstances of a letter, including its addressee, must always be taken into account. When
      writing to Engels, Marx takes much for granted and does not have to phrase his thoughts as they come to the pen
      in order to avoid ignorant or malicious misinterpretation. Some letters to others are diplomatizing. All letters
      are time-bound: opinions expressed (for example, about people) may change. <a id="page_4" class="calibre6"></a>Letters are prime
      examples of ad-hoc writings that cannot be usefully quoted until the context is evaluated.
    </div>

    <div class="alpha-list" id="foreword--35">
      a. Circular letters. These are very like political statements, more like considered articles than casual
      correspondence.
    </div>

    <div class="alpha-list" id="foreword--36">
      b. “Educational” letters. Written to strangers in some cases, to party leaders in others, these are written with
      some conscious effort to set down a view; but even so, without the responsibilities entailed by publication.
    </div>

    <div class="alpha-list" id="foreword--37">
      c. Intimate letters, where all is “thinking aloud” and no effort is made to avoid possible misunderstandings by a
      third party. Most of the correspondence between Marx and Engels comes under this head. Very often,
      general-sounding statements have specific contexts and meanings.
    </div>

    <div class="alpha-list" id="foreword--38">
      d. Casual or ad-hoc letters, perhaps hastily dashed off, given little or no consideration of any kind.
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="foreword--39">
      6. Private notes, notebooks, and workbooks. These were not only not written for publication but were often
      written in a personal “shorthand,” or in a telegraphic and allusive style, intended only for the writer’s eyes.
      The aforementioned <em id="foreword--40" class="calibre8">Grundrisse</em> is an example of a long work in this style; Marx’s
      “Conspectus of Bakunin’s Book &amp;c.” is a shorter and more fragmentary case.
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="foreword--41">
      This list does not touch on other lines of variation, such as the difference between the early Marx and the
      mature Marx. Whatever one’s views on this score, I do not understand how anyone can quote one of Marx’s <em id="foreword--42" class="calibre8">Rheinische Zeitung</em> articles of 1842—written before he was even a socialist—as if it were as
      valid a statement of “Marxism” as anything later, without even alerting the reader. The same is still true about
      (say) the first year in which Marx adopted socialism and started working out his theory and method; for example,
      in writing the so-called <em id="foreword--43" class="calibre8">Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts of 1844.</em> And it is still
      true in every later case where we know that the formation of Marx’s theory of society is <em id="foreword--44" class="calibre8">in
      process.</em> The opposite theory of quotation-mongering has it that “Marxism” is something that comes into the
      world integral and homogeneous: chip anything off this monolith (whether in 1842 or 1882, from a book or from a
      carbuncular grunt) and you have a “specimen” of Marxism which needs only to be put under the microscope to show
      anything you want to know, like a specimen pebble from a Precambrian stratum.
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="foreword--45">
      And we have not even mentioned the peculiar difficulties added by <a id="page_5" class="calibre6"></a>translations—difficulties
      from one standpoint, opportunities from another. In English books it is translations that are being quoted most
      of the time. But we cannot go into this here.
    </div>

    <h3 class="h2" id="foreword--47">“I AM NO MARXIST,” SAID HE</h3>

    <div class="indent" id="foreword--48">
      A number of examples of How Not to Quote Marx occur incidentally in the present volume, in the course of other
      expositions. Let us take an additional example, typical of its species, which we would not otherwise discuss, but
      which crops up frequently for easily understood reasons.
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="foreword--49">
      Professor George H. Sabine’s <em id="foreword--50" class="calibre8">History of Political Theory</em> begins its chapter on
      “Communism” with the following information:
    </div>

    <div class="bqi" id="foreword--51">
      Karl Marx once said of himself that he was not a Marxist. This remark referred in part to his own comparative
      indifference to the doctrinal completeness of his social philosophy and the misgivings with which he and Engels
      in their later life regarded the dogmatism of some of their disciples. It referred also to the wide variety of
      influences both theoretical and practical that flowed from his thought.<sup id="foreword--52" class="calibre13"><a id="forewordfn3" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="foreword--54" href="39_split_000.html#forewordfn3-r">3</a></sup>
    </div>

    <div class="noindent" id="foreword--55">
      Of the three things Marx is said to have referred to by this statement, at least two are fictional: Professor
      Sabine simply made them up. This is a space-efficient method of “interpretation,” since it wastes no time on
      presenting what Marx may have said on the subject. Countless other marxological authorities have quoted Marx’s
      <em id="foreword--56" class="calibre8">jeu d’esprit</em>, “I am no Marxist,” to prove other imaginative interpretations, including
      the thesis that there is no such thing as Marxism at all. Marx himself said so, didn’t he?
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="foreword--57">
      Indeed, the citing of Marx’s revelation of his non-Marxism seems to have accelerated in recent decades, if I am
      not mistaken—partly feeding on itself, and partly perhaps reflecting a cyclical shift from refuting Marx to
      defusing him, in that movement which swings from seeing him as a terrorist ogre to painting him as a tame
      pussycat. I ask the reader’s indulgence, therefore, for taking this space to present an assemblage of the facts,
      since this desperate recourse has never been taken before.
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="foreword--58">
      To begin with, it all stems from a pointed quip by Marx which we <a id="page_6" class="calibre6"></a>know of only because Engels
      mentioned it incidentally on four occasions, mostly in letters. By a pointed quip I mean a remark which is made
      in jocular form in order to soften a serious point. It follows that it is precisely the form, the literal
      wording, which is intended to be taken good-humoredly. The marxological transmogrification of this <em id="foreword--60" class="calibre8">boutade</em> (to use Longuet’s later expression) into a programmatic declaration for the ages is
      one of the monuments to marxological prestidigitation.
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="foreword--61">
      It is first mentioned by Engels in a letter written while Marx is still alive and a neighbor of his. Writing to
      Bernstein in 1882, Engels poohpoohs the assertion of a French Possibilist (reformist) that “Marxism” is
      discredited in France (Engels quote-marks the term because it was used in the assertion), but he goes on to
      indicate that he does not think much of this French “Marxism” himself.
    </div>

    <div class="bq" id="foreword--62">
      Now to be sure, so-called “Marxism” in France is an altogether peculiar product, so much so that Marx said to
      Lafargue: <em id="foreword--63" class="calibre8">ce qu’il y a de certain c’est que moi, je ne suis pas Marxiste</em> [what is
      certain is that, as for me, I am no Marxist].<sup id="foreword--64" class="calibre13"><a id="forewordfn4" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="foreword--66" href="39_split_000.html#forewordfn4-r">4</a></sup>
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="foreword--67">
      At the risk of overkill in explaining a joke—always a lugubrious thing to do—it must be pointed out that
      evidently Engels has not the slightest idea of the profound meanings that will be read into this. (This does not
      bother the marxologists, for it is one of the common tenets of the fraternity that Engels always got Marx all
      wrong, whatever he wrote.)<sup id="foreword--68" class="calibre13"><a id="forewordfn5" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="foreword--70" href="39_split_000.html#forewordfn5-r">5</a></sup>
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="foreword--71">
      Marx had to tell Lafargue face to face that he, a leader of the French movement, did not understand his own
      theory and politics—not in a quarrel but in a perfectly friendly fashion. This is the usual context of the
      pointed quip in civilized society. We know that this fits the background of Marx’s relations with his son-in-law
      and disciple, for there is plenty of evidence of Marx’s dim view of Lafargue’s theoretical-political capacity and
      his frequent state of exasperation with the Frenchman’s mistakes and inadequacies. The relationship can be seen
      even better in Engels’ voluminous correspondence with Lafargue, which continually verges on cordial irritation
      with the shortcomings and immaturity of the entire French party leadership; it is not only a question of Lafargue
      himself. (This is not the first time that Marx and Engels lament the incapacity of would-be disciples to
      understand their ideas, and it will not be the last.)<sup id="foreword--72" class="calibre13"><a id="forewordfn6" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="foreword--74" href="39_split_000.html#forewordfn6-r">6</a></sup> In the other three places where Engels
      mentions the same quip, this and nothing else is the content.
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="foreword--75">
      <a id="page_7" class="calibre6"></a>Let us set these passages down for the full record. They all occur in 1890: in two letters
      written in August and in a published article a month later. In a letter to Schmidt, Engels deplores the quality
      of a book review by Moritz Wirth:
    </div>

    <div class="bq" id="foreword--77">
      … little Moritz is a calamitous friend. The materialist conception of history too has a lot of such friends
      today, to whom it serves as a pretext for <em id="foreword--78" class="calibre8">not</em> studying history. Just as Marx said
      about the French “Marxists” of the late seventies: “<em id="foreword--79" class="calibre8">Tout ce que je sais, c’est que je ne
      suis pas Marxiste</em>” [All I know is that I am no Marxist].<sup id="foreword--80" class="calibre13"><a id="forewordfn7" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="foreword--82" href="39_split_000.html#forewordfn7-r">7</a></sup>
    </div>

    <div class="noindent" id="foreword--83">
      Three weeks later Engels recalls this again, writing to Lafargue himself. The subject here is the faction of
      intellectuals in the German party called the “Jungen,” which is discussed below in <a class="nounder1" id="foreword--84" href="26.html#ch17">Chapter 17</a>:
    </div>

    <div class="bq" id="foreword--85">
      These gentlemen all go in for Marxism, but of the kind you were familiar with in France ten years ago and of
      which Marx used to say: <em id="foreword--86" class="calibre8">“tout ce que je sais c’est que je ne suis pas marxiste moi!”</em>
      And he would probably have said of these gentlemen what Heine said of his imitators: I sowed dragons and I reaped
      fleas.<sup id="foreword--87" class="calibre13"><a id="forewordfn8" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="foreword--89" href="39_split_000.html#forewordfn8-r">8</a></sup> [This entire letter is in French.]
    </div>

    <div class="noindent" id="foreword--90">
      In a few days Engels has to write a public reproof of the “Jungen” faction, for publication in a party paper.
      Marx’s saying is still in his mind, and his open letter includes the following:
    </div>

    <div class="bq" id="foreword--91">
      Marx foresaw also these disciples when, toward the end of the ’70s, he said of the then prevailing “Marxism” of
      certain Frenchmen: “<em id="foreword--92" class="calibre8">tout ce que je sais, c’est que moi</em>, <em id="foreword--93" class="calibre8">je ne
      suis pas marxiste</em>”—“all I know is that I am no ‘Marxist.’”<sup id="foreword--94" class="calibre13"><a id="forewordfn9" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="foreword--96" href="39_split_000.html#forewordfn9-r">9</a></sup>

      This is the first time it appears in print.<a id="foreworden1-r" class="calibre6"></a><a class="nounder1" id="foreword--99" href="43.html#foreworden1">*</a>
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="foreword--100">
      <a id="page_8" class="calibre6"></a>In short, all facts indicate we have a perfectly ordinary situation in which Marx—in order to
      tell a comrade and friend (and son-in-law) that in all frankness he does not know his class from his elbow—uses a
      time-honored method of taking the edge off a blunt criticism: <em id="foreword--102" class="calibre8">If what you people are
      putting out is “Marxism,” then I’m no Marxist.</em> This sort of thing has been done several thousand times with
      less brouhaha.
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="foreword--103">
      But isn’t it odd for Marx to “deny” he is a Marxist, even jocularly? On the contrary, it would have been odd if
      he had reacted any other way, when the term began to show up. All historical figures who are fated to be suffixed
      with <em id="foreword--104" class="calibre8">-ist</em> (or, worse still, <em id="foreword--105" class="calibre8">-ite</em>) abjure it to begin
      with; for these tags almost always begin by being used as epithets by enemies. The reason is simple: labeling a
      set of ideas or policies with an individual’s name makes it seem “personal” and cliquish; and this is often the
      conscious intent of the labeling.
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="foreword--106">
      Robert Owen devised a dozen labels for his ideas and organizations, but never “Owenite.” Proudhon said: “I am
      told that somewhere or other there are people who call themselves Proudhonists; they must be imbeciles …”<sup id="foreword--107" class="calibre13"><a id="forewordfn12" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="foreword--109" href="39_split_000.html#forewordfn12-r">12</a></sup> John Wilkes, hearing someone fulsomely praise his speeches to his face,

      times, Trotsky wrote polemics to prove that “Trotskyism” was nothing but an invention of the Stalinists, whereas
      he preferred to call his views “Bolshevik-Leninism”even though his own followers called themselves Trotskyists
      quite freely; and while Stalin by exception promoted the use of the term <em id="foreword--113" class="calibre8">Stalinism</em> as
      an <a id="page_9" class="calibre6"></a>honorific at home, his followers abroad commonly took the label as a Trotskyite slander on
      a leader who was merely an unhyphenated Leninist—a term Lenin eschewed. So it goes. The initial indignant
      rejection of conferred -<em id="foreword--115" class="calibre8">isms</em>, <em id="foreword--116" class="calibre8">ists,</em> and <em id="foreword--117" class="calibre8">ites</em> is so standard in political history that one wonders how it escaped the attention of
      the marxologists who work wonders with Marx’s innocent quip.
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="foreword--118">
      As usual, the term <em id="foreword--119" class="calibre8">Marxist</em> was invented by enemies. Even so, it took some time to
      show up. As soon as Marx came on the scene as the proponent of a particular approach to socialism, rivals pointed
      fingers at the “Marx tendency.” It is hard to see how one can denounce a viewpoint without putting a name to it.
      Marx might want to call his views “scientific socialism” or by some other nonpersonal designation, but an enemy
      has no inhibitions about personalizing things immediately.
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="foreword--120">
      “Marx tendency” or “Marx group” translates into German as <em id="foreword--121" class="calibre8">Partei Marx</em> (which does not
      mean “Marx party” in our current sense). It is <em id="foreword--122" class="calibre8">Partei Marx</em> that first showed up,
      along with <em id="foreword--123" class="calibre8">Partei Everybody Else.</em> It was probably used during the 1846 dispute with
      Weitling and Kriege. Hess, temporarily distressed by the “Circular Against Kriege,” wrote to Marx: “with your
      party I will have nothing more to do.”<sup id="foreword--124" class="calibre13"><a id="forewordfn14" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="foreword--126" href="39_split_000.html#forewordfn14-r">14</a></sup> What <em id="foreword--127" class="calibre8">Partei?</em> Well, the
      Circular had charged in its first lines that Kriege had compromised the “communist party.” Kriege himself
      retorted that “the ‘party’ that Marx allegedly represents does not exist.” Hess just as freely referred to the
      “Kriege ‘Partei’ ” in a letter.<sup id="foreword--128" class="calibre13"><a id="forewordfn15" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="foreword--130" href="39_split_000.html#forewordfn15-r">15</a></sup> I also think that the tag <em id="foreword--131" class="calibre8">Partei Marx</em> was used for the <em id="foreword--132" class="calibre8">Neue Rheinische Zeitung</em> group in
      1848–1849—by others, not by Marx’s collaborators.<sup id="foreword--133" class="calibre13"><a id="forewordfn16" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="foreword--135" href="39_split_000.html#forewordfn16-r">16</a></sup> All this was standard operating
      procedure, and not very relevant, since it was so common.

    <div class="indent" id="foreword--136">
      <em id="foreword--137" class="calibre8">Partei Marx</em> was spread over the whole German press in 1852 when the Prussian
      government organized its frame-up trial of the Cologne Communists and featured the designation in the official
      indictment, along with <em id="foreword--138" class="calibre8">Partei Willich-Schapper</em>.<sup id="foreword--139" class="calibre13"><a id="forewordfn17" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="foreword--141" href="39_split_000.html#forewordfn17-r">17</a></sup> The split in
      the Communist League in September 1850 had produced these two factions or groups, and the government’s case
      revolved around them. Marx’s pamphlet for the defense, <em id="foreword--142" class="calibre8">Revelations on the Communist Trial
      in Cologne</em>, discussing the alleged evidence, was peppered with references to both of the group labels—but
      with a typical difference. <em id="foreword--143" class="calibre8">“Partei Marx</em>” almost always appeared in quote-marks; not
      so <em id="foreword--144" class="calibre8">Partei Willich-Schapper</em>.<sup id="foreword--145" class="calibre13"><a id="forewordfn18" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="foreword--147" href="39_split_000.html#forewordfn18-r">18</a></sup> The tag popped up contemporaneously in a
      letter by Mrs. Jenny Marx and one <a id="page_10" class="calibre6"></a>by Engels.<sup id="foreword--149" class="calibre13"><a id="forewordfn19" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="foreword--151" href="39_split_000.html#forewordfn19-r">19</a></sup> But in fact
      Marx’s name had not yet been converted into an ism.<a id="foreworden2-r" class="calibre6"></a><a class="nounder1" id="foreword--153" href="43.html#foreworden2">*</a>

    <div class="indent" id="foreword--154">
      This contribution—the invention of the terms <em id="foreword--155" class="calibre8">Marxian</em> and <em id="foreword--156" class="calibre8">Marxist—</em>seems to have taken place in 1872 as the struggle in the International heated up
      before the Hague Congress. It was made by Bakunin and his bore-from-within clique, in particular his first
      lieutenant James Guillaume. Characteristically, the new labels were <em id="foreword--157" class="calibre8">not</em> applied to
      Marxists (in any sense we would recognize) but to the majority on the General Council which was opposed to
      Bakunin, and which thus was accused of being Marx’s creatures.
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="foreword--158">
      The first appearance, as far as we know, was in a faction-organizing letter sent by Bakunin to Italy, dated
      January 23, charging that “the Jewish-Teutonic, or Marxian, group which still dominates the General Council”
      wants to convert the International into a kind of state, and so on. His attack on “the Marxians in the General
      Council” offers Bakunin’s common mix of anti-Semitism, racialism, and slander, as he denounces “the hatred of
      Marx and the Marxians against us … That is the way Germans and especially German Jews combat their
      opponents.”<sup id="foreword--159" class="calibre13"><a id="forewordfn21" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="foreword--161" href="39_split_000.html#forewordfn21-r">21</a></sup> Bakunin uses <em id="foreword--162" class="calibre8">marxien</em>, in more or less the same
      way he uses <em id="foreword--163" class="calibre8">mazzinien</em> in dealing with Mazzini.
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="foreword--164">
      A few months later, the Bakuninists published letters of protest against the General Council’s pamphlet <em id="foreword--165" class="calibre8">The Alleged Schisms in the International</em>, written by Marx and Engels. Bakunin’s letter,
      dated June 12, denounced <em id="foreword--166" class="calibre8">“la politique marxienne”</em> along with the “German and Russian
      Jews” who were Marx’s “agents,” particularly “the little Russian Jew” (N. Utin) who was Bakunin’s chief opponent
      in Geneva, all of them being accused of holding dangerous ambitions, “both personal and racial,” implying a
      Jewish conspiracy.<sup id="foreword--167" class="calibre13"><a id="forewordfn22" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="foreword--169" href="39_split_000.html#forewordfn22-r">22</a></sup> A broadside by Guillaume dated June 10 likewise exposed “M. Marx’s Jewish
      lackeys,” but these lackeys were not called “Marxists” until his next letter of June 15. Among the imprecations
      that drip off his libertarian pen against the <em id="foreword--170" class="calibre8">“socialistes hébraïsants</em>” were, first,
      “the dynasty of <a id="page_11" class="calibre6"></a>Marxides,” then the “Marxist conspiracy,” and finally the “Marxists” <em id="foreword--172" class="calibre8">tout court</em>.<sup id="foreword--173" class="calibre13"><a id="forewordfn23" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="foreword--175" href="39_split_000.html#forewordfn23-r">23</a></sup> In this way, the first labels for the “Marxists” were
      born, like the first land animals, in a sea of mud.
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="foreword--176">
      Now one can be sure that the terms <em id="foreword--177" class="calibre8">Marxist</em> and <em id="foreword--178" class="calibre8">Marxism</em>
      would have eventually come into use by supporters of Marx, as well as by more or less objective historians; this
      usually happens with the passage of time and the subject’s death, to answer a need. The role of enemies seems to
      be to shortcut the process, for the reasons already mentioned. At any rate, <em id="foreword--179" class="calibre8">Marxism</em>
      did not come into accepted use in Marxist circles during Marx’s lifetime.<a id="foreworden3-r" class="calibre6"></a><a class="nounder1" id="foreword--181" href="43.html#foreworden3">*</a>
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="foreword--182">
      That Marx himself would reject the term <em id="foreword--183" class="calibre8">Marxist</em> was always beyond doubt. That his
      most intimate collaborators eschewed it also, up to a relatively late date, only underlines their natural
      reluctance to “personalize” a historic theory which made its way by rising above mere cliques and individual
      sects. Death removes not only the person but also the “personal” stigma of an ism, and so there was no really
      good reason for Engels and for Marx’s friends to keep quote-marking the term. Still less reason for tendentious
      marxology to make a fuss about it.

    <div class="indent" id="foreword--184">
      We look forward to the time when Marx’s quip will cease to be the favorite quotation of the quotation-mongers.

    <h3 class="h2" id="foreword--185"><a id="page_12" class="calibre15"></a>ABOUT THE PRESENT VOLUME</h3>

    <div class="indent" id="foreword--187">
      First, there are two reminders that need repeating from the Foreword to Volume 1. (1) The little superscript
      numbers that pepper these pages, pointing to the reference notes in the back, should be ignored by the general
      reader. These reference notes <em id="foreword--188" class="calibre8">never</em> add to the line of thought, being strictly
      confined to giving sources and other technical information. (2) An unorthodox sign is used here to indicate that
      certain quoted passages or words are in English in the original: the degree mark. A double degree mark (°°) at
      the beginning of a quotation means that the whole passage was originally written in English. Inside a quotation,
      words or phrases originally in English are marked off using the symbol like quotation marks, °as here.° In both
      forms, the device has been used only where there was reason to signal the fact, not in every case.
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="foreword--189">
      To my original remarks on extant translations, add this. It does a reader little good to be given a reference
      source that can be checked only with great difficulty, such as some out-of-print edition of a work by Marx
      obtainable only in research libraries. Sometimes there is no choice; but for this reason I have tried to confine
      my references to English versions as much as possible to easily accessible editions, whether or not those
      versions were actually used for citation. The new English edition of the Marx-Engels <em id="foreword--190" class="calibre8">Collected Works</em> (ME:CW) would be the ideal solution, not because of the quality of its
      translations (which is very spotty), but because it should remain in print and generally available for a long
      time, and because it is inclusive. Unfortunately, only the first seven volumes are out as this is written. Still,
      wherever possible I have given the ME:CW location of a passage. This lacking, I have used, as the second in order
      of preference, the Marx-Engels <em id="foreword--191" class="calibre8">Selected Works in Three Volumes</em> (ME:SW). In these and
      other cases, the reference is bracketed if it was not actually used for quotation but is merely given for
      information. Forthcoming ME:CW volumes will continue to be used in this way as the English-language hitching
      post.
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="foreword--192">
      The tentative outline of Volume 2 which appeared in the first volume listed two chapters which have since been
      moved. The planned chapter on the women’s rights movement has been returned to its original position in a later
      volume, along with the subject of Marx’s views on women’s emancipation in general. The chapter listed as
      “Nationalism and revolution” will be treated as part of a larger subject <a id="page_13" class="calibre6"></a>without which it
      does not make sense: Nationalism, internationalism, and foreign policy. In order to gain adequate space for this
      very extensive subject, and for two or three other subjects which will be crowded out of Volume 3, our present
      plan—in agreement with the publisher—calls for a fourth volume.
