    <div class="indent" id="ch04--2">
      A key to the nature of Marx’s conception of proletarian socialism is a seldom noted fact: Marx was the first
      leading figure in the history of socialism to adopt a position of support to trade unions and trade-unionism, on
      principle.
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="ch04--3">
      This position was not difficult to take in later decades, after the trade-union movement had entrenched itself;
      its success was not hard to recognize by that time. What Marx recognized in advance was the basic relationship of
      trade unions as an institution to the proletariat as a class and to the social revolution as a goal.
    </div>

    <h3 class="h2" id="ch04lev1">1. THE LITMUS-TEST</h3>

    <div class="indent" id="ch04--5">
      Before Marx, there were some individual socialists, at least in England, who took a positive and favorable view
      of these new-fangled workers’ “combinations,” and they too have received insufficient attention.<a id="ch04en1-r" class="calibre6"></a><a class="nounder1" id="ch04--7" href="43.html#ch04en1">*</a> In fact, their point of view now has
      to be exhumed from history, precisely because they did not make a lasting impress on the ongoing
      movement—unfortunately.
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="ch04--8">
      But of the recognized socialistic tendencies proliferating in the 1840s as well as in the preceding quarter of a
      century, all were hostile to the beginnings of trade unions to one degree or another, and from <a id="page_82" class="calibre6"></a>varying standpoints. The extreme form of one line was represented by P. J. Proudhon, the “father of
      anarchism”: he not only condemned trade unions and strikes on principle but vigorously approved gendarmes’
      shooting down strikers as enemies of society, that is, enemies of small property.<a id="ch04en2-r" class="calibre6"></a><a class="nounder1" id="ch04--11" href="43.html#ch04en2">*</a>
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="ch04--12">
      Quite different but also hostile was the standpoint of Chartist left-wingers like Ernest Jones, who rejected
      trade-unionism as a “fallacy,” not only useless but positively an evil, since it distracted workers from really
      revolutionary struggle.<sup id="ch04--13" class="calibre13"><a id="ch04fn5" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch04--15" href="39_split_000.html#ch04fn5-r">5</a></sup> This was an authentic expression of that leftist type of sectarianism which would
      long remain a powerful trend even in movements that were nominally Marxist. Typically, Jones’s attitude toward
      trade unions softened into support as he himself became more and more favorable to reform politics. In general,
      the future division between reformist rightism and sectarian leftism—both equally alien to Marx’s approach—was
      most clearly prefigured on the issue of the socialist attitude to this class organization.
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="ch04--16">
      Marx had occasion to assert his claim to historical priority in a letter in 1869, in connection with his book
      against Proudhon: “in 1847, when all the political economists and all the Socialists concurred on one single
      point—the condemnation of <em id="ch04--17" class="calibre8">Trade-Unions</em>, I demonstrated their historical
      necessity.”<sup id="ch04--18" class="calibre13"><a id="ch04fn6" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch04--20" href="39_split_000.html#ch04fn6-r">6</a></sup> Less than three decades later, so far forgotten was this earlier period that
      Engels had to explain to Bebel:
    </div>

    <div class="bq" id="ch04--21">
      … Marx’s assertion is true of <em id="ch04--22" class="calibre8">all</em> socialists who made their appearance up to that time
      (with the exception of us two, who were unknown in France) insofar as they had occasion to deal with
      combinations—with <em id="ch04--23" class="calibre8">Robert Owen</em> leading the procession.<a id="ch04en3-r" class="calibre6"></a><a class="nounder1" id="ch04--25" href="43.html#ch04en3">*</a> <a id="page_83" class="calibre6"></a>The same applies to the Owenists and
      among the French to Cabet. As there was no right of combination in France this question was little touched upon
      there. But since before Marx there existed only feudal, bourgeois, petty-bourgeois and utopian socialism, and
      socialism blended from various of these elements, it was clear that all of these socialists, each of whom claimed
      to possess a definite panacea and stood outside the real working-class movement, portrayed <em id="ch04--27" class="calibre8">every</em> form of the real movement, hence also combinations and strikes, as a false path which
      diverted the masses from the only way that leads to salvation, the way of the true faith.<sup id="ch04--28" class="calibre13"><a id="ch04fn9" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch04--30" href="39_split_000.html#ch04fn9-r">9</a></sup>
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="ch04--31">
      Why was Marx the first leading thinker to embrace trade-unionism, even in its first elementary forms, in his
      conception of the process leading to social revolution? The short answer is: because only Marx developed a
      socialist theory about the primary role of <em id="ch04--32" class="calibre8">class organization as such.</em> All other kinds of
      socialism looked to a much broader or much narrower constituency: in one case, all of The People, if not all of
      Humanity, or at least all of the people who were not “idlers”; in the other, an elite band of revolutionists, or
      a somewhat less elite party of the Enlightened. These other socialisms might seek or claim a special orientation
      toward the proletariat as a recruiting ground or other convenience,<sup id="ch04--33" class="calibre13"><a id="ch04fn10" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch04--35" href="39_split_000.html#ch04fn10-r">10</a></sup> but in no case was the
      class line in organization the basic road to their revolution.
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="ch04--36">
      This indeed is another way of explaining how Marxism defines itself as proletarian socialism, as the socialism of
      a class, and not a socialism derived from a predilection for or a vision of a future social order. It also
      explains why the trade-union question has been one of the most reliable litmus-tests of the real nature of a
      given socialist tendency, that is, of its view of the relationship between socialism and the proletariat.
    </div>

    <h3 class="h2" id="ch04lev2"><a id="page_84" class="calibre15"></a>2. EARLY CONSIDERATIONS</h3>

    <div class="indent" id="ch04--39">
      Marx’s ideas on trade-unionism, because of the nature of the subject, go through a steady course of development
      over the decades, not because of changes in underlying conceptions but because concrete experience was necessary
      to flesh out generalities. There are two kinds of experience involved here: Marx’s own, and the developing
      reality of trade unions themselves.
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="ch04--40">
      There was no trade-union movement in the Rhineland for the young Marx to encounter. In the Paris to which he
      moved next, it was only a nascent phenomenon. Even in England, where Engels first found that trade unions were
      already a power, they had been flourishing for only two decades when the young German visitor was writing his
      book on <em id="ch04--41" class="calibre8">The Condition of the Working Class.</em> In the 1850s, especially in dispatches to the
      <em id="ch04--42" class="calibre8">New York Tribune</em>, Marx followed trade-union struggles and strike movements closely; in
      1853 his articles were filled with strike news; but it was all necessarily observed from the outside. It was with
      the organization of the International that Marx began to work closely with a number of trade-unionists in
      England, and then, as unions were established in Germany and elsewhere, widened his experience. Finally, it was
      after his death that English trade-unionism took the heartening turn he had been anticipating, and so it was
      Engels alone who had the opportunity to learn from the “New Unionism,” as well as to follow the movement on the
      Continent.
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="ch04--43">
      It was the young Engels who undoubtedly played the initiatory role in this field, as also in turning Marx’s
      attention to political economy. Certainly, Engels’ <em id="ch04--44" class="calibre8">Condition of the Working Class in
      England</em>, which he began writing toward the end of 1844, is already quite clear in its attitude toward
      “[t]hese different sections of workingmen, often united, often separated, Trade Unionists, Chartists, and
      [Owenite] Socialists.”<sup id="ch04--45" class="calibre13"><a id="ch04fn11" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch04--47" href="39_split_000.html#ch04fn11-r">11</a></sup> When we today read his chapter on “Labor Movements,” the first half of which is
      devoted to a sympathetic account of the then trade-union movement, its friendly tone is so familiar to us that it
      is hard to grasp how extraordinary it was for the socialism of the day. “Engels,” wrote Ryazanov, “was the first
      who endeavored to give a theoretical exposition of the course of trade-union development among the
      workers,”<sup id="ch04--48" class="calibre13"><a id="ch04fn12" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch04--50" href="39_split_000.html#ch04fn12-r">12</a></sup> but, more than that, his book was the first important attempt to do this within
      the framework of a revolutionary socialist standpoint. It was the first influential product of socialist thought
      that <a id="page_85" class="calibre6"></a>rejected the two prevalent attitudes—the opinion that trade-unionism was useless or
      harmful to socialism, and the belief that it was all-sufficient for workers’ interests, in short, sectarianism
      and reformism—in order to assume the <em id="ch04--52" class="calibre8">integration</em> of trade-unionism into the socialist
      perspective of revolution.
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="ch04--53">
      As we have seen,<sup id="ch04--54" class="calibre13"><a id="ch04fn13" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch04--56" href="39_split_000.html#ch04fn13-r">13</a></sup> Engels’ theoretical outlook is here far from generalized as yet, but it is
      quite clear that what is important to him about trade unions is their character as the movement of a class.
      Shortly after publication of the book (and after moving to Brussels to live near Marx), Engels explained to
      readers that “I was chiefly concerned to describe the position of the bourgeoisie and the proletariat in relation
      to each other and the necessity of struggle between these two classes; and that I attached especial importance to
      proving how completely justified the proletariat was in waging this struggle …”<sup id="ch04--57" class="calibre13"><a id="ch04fn14" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch04--59" href="39_split_000.html#ch04fn14-r">14</a></sup>
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="ch04--60">
      Up to this point, Marx’s writings had paid little or no attention to trade unions. In the Paris manuscripts of
      1844 there is a passing reference at the beginning that merely echoes Adam Smith.<sup id="ch04--61" class="calibre13"><a id="ch04fn15" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch04--63" href="39_split_000.html#ch04fn15-r">15</a></sup> In <em id="ch04--64" class="calibre8">The
      Holy Family</em> a reference to English and French workers’ associations is buried in philosophic fuzz.<sup id="ch04--65" class="calibre13"><a id="ch04fn16" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch04--67" href="39_split_000.html#ch04fn16-r">16</a></sup> In
      <em id="ch04--68" class="calibre8">The German Ideology</em>, the first work of close collaboration with Engels, a generally
      favorable attitude toward trade unions shines weakly through two passages of polemic against Stirner. The
      references are incidental, but suggestive. Stirner, the protoanarchist, has announced that the workers need only
      cease work to win all power. (The illusion of the victorious General Strike with Folded Arms arose as one of the
      infantile notions of radicalism.) Marx and Engels reply that
    </div>

    <div class="bq" id="ch04--69">
      even a minority of workers who combine and go on strike very soon find themselves compelled to act in a
      revolutionary way—a fact he could have learned from the 1842 uprising [general strike] in England and from the
      earlier Welsh uprising of 1839, in which year the revolutionary excitement among the workers first found
      comprehensive expression in the “sacred month,” which was proclaimed simultaneously with a general arming of the
      people.<sup id="ch04--70" class="calibre13"><a id="ch04fn17" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch04--72" href="39_split_000.html#ch04fn17-r">17</a></sup>
    </div>

    <div class="noindent" id="ch04--73">
      Engels’ <em id="ch04--74" class="calibre8">Condition of the Working Class</em> had already expressed a similar sense of the
      limitations of trade-union action.
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="ch04--75">
      In <em id="ch04--76" class="calibre8">The German Ideology</em>, however, the positive side of trade-unionism gets emphasized in
      another sally against Stirner many pages away. Stirner sees the workers only in connection with his talk about
      “seizing employers by the throat” and similar fustian, while he thinks <a id="page_86" class="calibre6"></a>that workers who
      demand higher wages are treated as criminals. Marx and Engels point out that, unlike Stirner’s universe
      (Prussia), in England, America, and Belgium workers who act for higher wages are by no means necessarily treated
      as criminals but “on the contrary quite often actually succeed in obtaining higher wages.” They ridicule the tall
      talk about “seizing by the throat,” as if this had any meaning short of revolution; the workers would gain
      nothing, “or at any rate much less than through associations and strikes.”<sup id="ch04--78" class="calibre13"><a id="ch04fn18" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch04--80" href="39_split_000.html#ch04fn18-r">18</a></sup>
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="ch04--81">
      The first fruits of Marx’s economic studies do not appear until his <em id="ch04--82" class="calibre8">Poverty of Philosophy</em>
      in 1847; the closing chapter is on “Strikes and Combinations of Workers.” Here we get the first clear statement
      of his view of trade unions in the context of his theory on the relationship of socialism and class.
    </div>

    <div class="indentb" id="ch04--83">
      Workers’ unions grow along with modern industry; the degree of unionization is index to a country’s rank on the
      world market; thus England has “the biggest and best organized combinations.” Not only partial and temporary
      combinations formed ad hoc for a strike: “Permanent combinations have been formed, °<em id="ch04--84" class="calibre8">trades
      unions</em>,° which serve as bulwarks for the workers in their struggles with the employers.” This goes on
      simultaneously with the organization of a workers’ political movement by the Chartists.
    </div>

    <div class="bqi2" id="ch04--85">
      The first attempts of workers to <em id="ch04--86" class="calibre8">associate</em> among themselves always takes place in the form
      of combinations.
    </div>

    <div class="bqi2" id="ch04--87">
      Large-scale industry concentrates in one place a crowd of people unknown to one another. Competition divides
      their interests. But the maintenance of wages, this common interest which they have against their boss, unites
      them in a common thought of resistance—<em id="ch04--88" class="calibre8">combination.</em><sup id="ch04--89" class="calibre13"><a id="ch04fn19" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch04--91" href="39_split_000.html#ch04fn19-r">19</a></sup>

    <div class="noindentt" id="ch04--92">
      It acquires a “double aim,” not only to stop competition among the workers, but to “carry on general competition
      with the capitalist.”
    </div>

    <div class="bq" id="ch04--93">
      If the first aim of resistance was merely the maintenance of wages, combinations, at first isolated, constitute
      themselves into groups as the capitalists in their turn unite for the purpose of repression, and in face of
      always united capital, the maintenance of the association becomes more necessary to them than that of wages. This
      is so true that English economists are amazed to see the workers sacrifice a good part of their wages in favor of
      associations, which, in the eyes of these economists, are established solely in favor of wages. In this
      struggle—a veritable civil <a id="page_87" class="calibre6"></a>war—all the elements necessary for a coming battle unite and
      develop. Once it has reached this point, association takes on a political character.<sup id="ch04--95" class="calibre13"><a id="ch04fn20" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch04--97" href="39_split_000.html#ch04fn20-r">20</a></sup>
    </div>

    <div class="noindent" id="ch04--98">
      Marx then summarizes the class meaning of this development:
    </div>

    <div class="bqi" id="ch04--99">
      Economic conditions had first transformed the mass of the people of the country into workers. The domination of
      capital has created for this mass a common situation, common interests. This mass is thus already a class as
      against capital, but not yet for itself. In the struggle, of which we have pointed out only a few phases, this
      mass becomes united, and constitutes itself as a class for itself. The interests it defends become class
      interests. But the struggle of class against class is a political struggle.<sup id="ch04--100" class="calibre13"><a id="ch04fn21" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch04--102" href="39_split_000.html#ch04fn21-r">21</a></sup>

    <div class="indent" id="ch04--103">
      We have already explained the Hegelese term “class for itself.”<sup id="ch04--104" class="calibre13"><a id="ch04fn22" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch04--106" href="39_split_000.html#ch04fn22-r">22</a></sup> By organizing, in the course of struggle, an
      atomized class becomes a self-conscious class, and the interests of proletarian individuals are generalized into
      class interests. Why “the struggle of class against class is a political struggle” will be touched on in

    <div class="indent" id="ch04--109">
      The same line of thought is summarized in the <em id="ch04--110" class="calibre8">Communist Manifesto</em>, more neatly but less
      vividly. Due to the growth of industry, the increase in the proletarian mass, and their increasing insecurity,
    </div>

    <div class="bq" id="ch04--111">
      the collisions between individual workmen and individual bourgeois take more and more the character of collisions

      Victories are only temporary. “The real fruit of their battle lies, not in the immediate result, but in the

      Marx the basic fact of the road to social revolution. Special emphasis must be placed on two words.
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="ch04--123">
      First, it is the <em id="ch04--124" class="calibre8">organization</em> of workers on a classwide scale that tends to politicize
      the struggle. The working class needs organization only in order to carry on its struggle; in order to submit it
      needs no organization at all. The special function of class organization is class struggle, present or potential,
      reality or threat. This is not gainsaid by the fact that the established powers try to persuade the class
      organization to think in terms of class collaboration. If trade unions “are not made to fight against the
      encroachments of capital what are they made for?” challenged Engels.<sup id="ch04--125" class="calibre13"><a id="ch04fn25" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch04--127" href="39_split_000.html#ch04fn25-r">25</a></sup>
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="ch04--128">
      Second, <em id="ch04--129" class="calibre8">class:</em> it is the role of trade unions in the beginnings of this process that
      makes them the class organizations of the proletariat par excellence. This view has always put Marx’s theory at
      loggerheads with those socialists who considered themselves too revolutionary to bother with such unenlightened
      organizations as trade unions.
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="ch04--130">
      The point was sharpened in Germany, where a trade-union movement started developing only after a socialist group
      was already in existence and desirous of heading off a rival. This was the attitude of the Lassallean
      organization, headed by J. B. von Schweitzer. Marx condemned it as soon as it showed itself. Schweitzer realizes,
      wrote Marx, “that with the development of a <em id="ch04--131" class="calibre8">real</em> workers’ organization in Germany based
      on trade unions, his artificial league of sectarians °would soon be nowhere.°” Engels agreed, in the same
      terms.<sup id="ch04--132" class="calibre13"><a id="ch04fn26" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch04--134" href="39_split_000.html#ch04fn26-r">26</a></sup>
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="ch04--135">
      The growth of the <em id="ch04--136" class="calibre8">real</em> class organizations did in fact undermine the league of
      sectarians, so much so that the Lassalleans were forced in a few years to accept unity with the pro-trade-union
      socialists led by Bebel and Liebknecht. When this unity took place at the Gotha congress in 1875, among the many
      defects of the proposed party program which Marx and Engels attacked was its remnant of a Lassallean attitude
      toward the trade unions. Engels stormed:
    </div>

    <div class="bq" id="ch04--137">
      … there is a not a word [in the program] about the organization of the working class as a class by means of the
      trade unions. And that is a very essential point, for this is the real class organization of the proletariat, in
      which it carries on its daily struggles with capital, in which it trains itself…<sup id="ch04--138" class="calibre13"><a id="ch04fn27" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch04--140" href="39_split_000.html#ch04fn27-r">27</a></sup>

    <div class="indent" id="ch04--141">
      <a id="page_89" class="calibre6"></a>Since the trade union is “the real class organization of the proletariat,” Marx liked to show
      that bourgeois fears of trade-unionism corresponded to this basic class character. He did this in some detail in
      his reports on English strike movements for the <em id="ch04--143" class="calibre8">New York Tribune;</em> it is also piquant to
      see how he did this with respect to a very early stage in the story. A chapter in <em id="ch04--144" class="calibre8">Capital</em>
      on the history of anti-working-class legislation ends with the episode of the Le Chapelier law of 1791, passed by
      the French revolutionary Assembly to ban trade-unionism in the name of Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity. This
      law “by means of State compulsion, confined the struggle between capital and labor within limits comfortable for
      capital…” Marx writes with indignation:
    </div>

    <div class="bq" id="ch04--145">
      “Granting,” says Le Chapelier, the reporter of the Select Committee on this law, “that wages ought to be a little
      higher than they are …” yet the workers must not be allowed to come to any understanding about their own
      interests, nor to act in common and thereby lessen their “absolute dependence, which is almost that of slavery”;
      because, forsooth, in doing this they injure “the freedom of their ci-devant masters, the present entrepreneurs”
      …<sup id="ch04--146" class="calibre13"><a id="ch04fn28" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch04--148" href="39_split_000.html#ch04fn28-r">28</a></sup>
    </div>

    <div class="noindent" id="ch04--149">
      This early bourgeois fear of trade unions was not simply a characteristic of the Third Estate deputy Le
      Chapelier; Marx points also at Robespierre himself. In 1865, when there was talk in Prussia of abolishing the
      anti-trade-union law, Marx commented:
    </div>

    <div class="bq" id="ch04--150">
      <em id="ch04--151" class="calibre8">En passant:</em> the Prussian anti-trade-union-law, like all the Continental laws of the kind,
      stems from the decree of the <em id="ch04--152" class="calibre8">Assemblée Constituante of 14 June 1791</em> [the Le Chapelier
      law], in which the French bourgeois very severely punished °anything of the sort,° including workers’
      associations of every kind—for example, by loss of civil rights for a year—under the pretext that this was
      <em id="ch04--153" class="calibre8">restoration of the guilds</em> and in contradiction with constitutional liberty and the
      “Rights of Man.” It is very characteristic of Robespierre that, at a time when it was a crime punished by the
      guillotine to be “Constitutional” in the sense of the Assemblée of 1789, he kept in force all of its laws <em id="ch04--154" class="calibre8">against</em> the workers.<sup id="ch04--155" class="calibre13"><a id="ch04fn29" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch04--157" href="39_split_000.html#ch04fn29-r">29</a></sup>
    </div>

    <div class="noindent" id="ch04--158">
      Yet in 1791 the number of modern wage-workers to be repressed was small. The proletariat as a class was in the
      egg, and so was class organization. But the class’s built-in drive to organize was enough to draw the lightning.

    <div class="indent" id="ch04--159">
      From 1791 through the nineteenth century, the fears of the bourgeoisie <a id="page_90" class="calibre6"></a>were an index to the
      class character of even far from classconscious trade unions. In 1853 Marx informed his <em id="ch04--161" class="calibre8">Tribune</em> readers of the meaning of the strike wave by quoting the English bourgeois press: “The
      agitation at present,” wrote the <em id="ch04--162" class="calibre8">Weekly Times</em>, “is limited to a series of independent
      skirmishes, but there are indications that the period is not very distant when this desultory warfare will be

    <h3 class="h2" id="ch04lev4">4. ENGELS LAYS THE BASIS</h3>

    <div class="indent" id="ch04--167">
      The workers’ propensity for trade-union organization was something of an economic mystery, during most of the
      nineteenth century, for the bourgeois economists and also for most of the socialists. Both proved very handily,
      over and over, that the workers could never gain anything by strikes and trade-union struggles; therefore it all
      made no sense. The economists concluded that the workers should rely on sweet harmony with their employers; the
      socialists concluded that only their own favorite political sect had anything to offer. Despite these
      near-unanimous assurances, the working class of England—followed in time by the Continental workers—organized
      unions more and more solidly, and engaged in strike movements in waves, at considerable sacrifice.
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="ch04--168">
      Marx did not fully work out his economic theory on this subject until shortly before the publication of <em id="ch04--169" class="calibre8">Capital;</em> a key component was clarified only about 1865. Yet, as we have seen, Marx took a
      positive view of trade-unionism long before this, and Engels even before him. On what ground?
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="ch04--170">
      The answer appears most clearly from Engels’ early work, which accepts the prevalent view that trade unions
      cannot improve workers’ economic conditions for the class as a whole, because of “the economic law according to
      which wages are determined by the relation between supply and demand in the labor market. Hence the Unions remain
      powerless against all <em id="ch04--171" class="calibre8">great</em> forces which influence this relation.” This echoes the
      position of the left Chartists and Owenites as well as of the bourgeois world. But Engels urges a significant
      qualification: unions do have power when dealing with “minor, single influences,” presumably meaning capitalists
      who are out of line; and unless resisted, capitalists would “gradually reduce wages to a lower and lower point …
      and <a id="page_91" class="calibre6"></a>wages would soon reach the minimum.” This tendency “is, <em id="ch04--173" class="calibre8">under average
      conditions</em>, somewhat restricted by the opposition of the workingmen.”<sup id="ch04--174" class="calibre13"><a id="ch04fn31" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch04--176" href="39_split_000.html#ch04fn31-r">31</a></sup>
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="ch04--177">
      Still, Engels concedes here to the consensus of the authorities that unions are powerless to affect the overall
      forces and patterns of the labor market, and that time and again their struggles end in disastrous
      sacrifices.<a id="ch04en5-r" class="calibre6"></a><a class="nounder1" id="ch04--179" href="43.html#ch04en1">*</a> He then asks the
      question that people like Ernest Jones failed to ask:
    </div>

    <div class="bqi" id="ch04--180">
      It will be asked, “Why, then, do the workers strike in such cases, when the uselessness of such measures is so
      evident?” Simply because they <em id="ch04--181" class="calibre8">must</em> protest against every reduction, even if dictated by
      necessity; because they feel bound to proclaim that they, as human beings, shall not be made to bow to social
      circumstances, but social conditions ought to yield to them as human beings; because silence on their part would
      be a recognition of these social conditions, an admission of the right of the bourgeoisie to exploit the workers
      in good times and let them starve in bad ones. Against this the workingmen must rebel so long as they have not
      lost all human feeling, and that they protest in this way and no other, comes of their being practical English
      people, who express themselves in <em id="ch04--182" class="calibre8">action</em>, and do not, like German theorists, go to sleep
      as soon as their protest is properly registered …<sup id="ch04--183" class="calibre13"><a id="ch04fn33" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch04--185" href="39_split_000.html#ch04fn33-r">33</a></sup>
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="ch04--186">
      So goes the humanistic motivation. Then there is a passing reference to economic motive which does not outlast
      the sentence, followed once more by subjective considerations of class-consciousness:
    </div>

    <div class="bq" id="ch04--187">
      The active resistance of the English workingmen has its effect in holding the money-greed of the bourgeoisie
      within certain limits, and keeping alive the opposition of the workers to the social and <a id="page_92" class="calibre6"></a>political omnipotence of the bourgeoisie, while it compels the admission that something more is
      needed than Trades Unions and strikes to break the power of the ruling class. But what gives these Unions and the
      strikes arising from them their real importance is this, that they are the first attempt of the workers to
      abolish competition.<sup id="ch04--189" class="calibre13"><a id="ch04fn34" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch04--191" href="39_split_000.html#ch04fn34-r">34</a></sup>
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="ch04--192">
      Unions try first to abolish competition among workers, that is, one-sidedly; but competition is “the vital nerve
      of the present social order”; therefore workers are led “to abolish not only one kind of competition, but
      competition itself altogether, and that they will do.”<sup id="ch04--193" class="calibre13"><a id="ch04fn35" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch04--195" href="39_split_000.html#ch04fn35-r">35</a></sup>
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="ch04--196">
      Finally, trade-union struggle is a training for the class war. “The incredible frequency of these strikes proves
      best of all to what extent the social war has broken out all over England.” The strikes are skirmishes. “They are
      the military school of the workingmen in which they prepare themselves for the great struggle which cannot be
      avoided … And as schools of war, the Unions are unexcelled.”<sup id="ch04--197" class="calibre13"><a id="ch04fn36" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch04--199" href="39_split_000.html#ch04fn36-r">36</a></sup>
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="ch04--200">
      The weak side of this explanation, once we are beyond the partial economic motivation suggested, is that it
      explains why socialists should support these trade-union struggles from their own standpoint (and this is
      uppermost for Engels, to be sure), but it does not really explain why the mass of non-socialist and
      non-class-conscious workers persist in their allegedly irrational course. But this problem, which could be
      answered only by a more sophisticated theory of capitalist economy, is not in the center of Engels’ thinking. The
      strong side of his approach, and its important contribution, is that it clearly projects trade unions as the
      organizations of elementary resistance of the class, pointing from elementary resistance on to final class power.

    <h3 class="h2" id="ch04lev5">5. THE ROLE OF TRADE-UNIONISM IN MARX’S THEORY</h3>

    <div class="indent" id="ch04--202">
      Let us now summarize what the trade-union movement means in terms of Marx’s mature theory. Much of the foregoing,
      of course, still holds.
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="ch04--203">
      1. <em id="ch04--204" class="calibre8">Elementary resistance.</em> The formulation by Engels in the preceding section is still the
      most compact, and should not be neglected <a id="page_93" class="calibre6"></a>simply because it is rarely converted into a
      theoretical statement. Workers are human beings before they are proletarians. Some critics have called <em id="ch04--206" class="calibre8">Capital</em> a “jeremiad” against the bourgeoisie, in derogation of its scientific objectivity
      (confusing objectivity with nonpartisanship). The kernel of truth is that Marx did not conceal the fact that the
      socialist animus against capitalist society is not solely based on the cold truths of political economy, which
      demonstrate that the animus is historically meaningful. In fact, Marx cut loose along these lines even more in
      his reportage on England for the <em id="ch04--207" class="calibre8">New York Tribune</em> and the German socialist press.
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="ch04--208">
      The point can be illustrated from the negative side by contrasting the anti–trade-union viewpoint of Lassalle,
      who fossilized the economic derogation of trade-unionism into a dogma based on an “iron law of wages.” Lassalle
      wrote: “The trade-union struggle of the worker is the futile struggle of the commodity Labor to act as a human
      being.”<sup id="ch04--209" class="calibre13"><a id="ch04fn37" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch04--211" href="39_split_000.html#ch04fn37-r">37</a></sup> Presumably because it was futile, Lassalle condemned the struggle. But because
      it <em id="ch04--212" class="calibre8">was</em> a struggle for humanness, Marx and Engels sought to integrate it into the road to
      social revolution.
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="ch04--213">
      2. <em id="ch04--214" class="calibre8">Defense of immediate economic interests.</em> An important codicil to his original
      acceptance of the bourgeois economists’ case against trade unions was suggested by Marx in 1853, as he explained
      the current strike wave in England: “Under certain circumstances, there is for the workman no other means of
      ascertaining whether he is or [is] not paid to the actual market value of his labor, but to strike or to threaten
      to do so.”<sup id="ch04--215" class="calibre13"><a id="ch04fn38" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch04--217" href="39_split_000.html#ch04fn38-r">38</a></sup>
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="ch04--218">
      But it was not until the 1860s that Marx completed his theory of wages, and hence of the economic basis of
      trade-unionism. He first wrote it up when he had to debate an Owenite member of the General Council of the
      International who maintained the old thesis that trade unions were positively harmful.<sup id="ch04--219" class="calibre13"><a id="ch04fn39" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch04--221" href="39_split_000.html#ch04fn39-r">39</a></sup> Marx’s presentation of

      establish that there <em id="ch04--224" class="calibre8">was</em> an area within which trade-union struggle could determine the
      economic conditions of the workers involved, that is, to overturn the dogma held by virtually all socialists
      <a id="page_94" class="calibre6"></a>who considered themselves revolutionists and many who did not.
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="ch04--226">
      It is true, Marx argued, that “the general tendency of capitalistic production is … to push the <em id="ch04--227" class="calibre8">value of labor</em> more or less to its <em id="ch04--228" class="calibre8">minimum limit</em>,” but

      is this saying that the working class ought to renounce their resistance against the encroachments of capital,
      and abandon their attempts at making the best of the occasional chances for their temporary improvement? If they
      did, they would be degraded to one level mass of broken wretches past salvation. I think I have shown that their
      struggles for the standard of wages are incidents inseparable from the whole wages system, that in 99 cases out
      of 100 their efforts at raising wages are only efforts at maintaining the given value of labor, and that the
      necessity of debating their price with the capitalist is inherent in their condition of having to sell themselves
      as commodities. By cowardly giving way in their every-day conflict with capital, they would certainly disqualify
      themselves for the initiating of any larger movement.<sup id="ch04--230" class="calibre13"><a id="ch04fn41" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch04--232" href="39_split_000.html#ch04fn41-r">41</a></sup>

    <div class="bq" id="ch04--234">
      °°Trades’ Unions work well as far as they counteract, if even temporarily, the tendency to a fall in the general
      rate of wages, and as far as they tend to shorten and regulate the time of labour, in other words, the extent of
      the working day. They work well as far as they are the means of organising the working class as a class.<sup id="ch04--235" class="calibre13"><a id="ch04fn42" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch04--237" href="39_split_000.html#ch04fn42-r">42</a></sup>

      in a series of popular articles for English workers. This presented a compact summary of why trade unions “are a
      necessity for the working classes in their struggle <a id="page_95" class="calibre6"></a>against capital,” specifically, of the
      area within which trade-union struggle can be effective. To cite only some essential sentences:
    </div>

    <div class="alpha-list" id="ch04--243">
      The average rate of wages is equal to the sum of necessaries sufficient to keep up the race of workmen in a
      certain country according to the standard of life habitual in that country. That standard of life may be very
      different for different classes of workmen. The great merit of Trades Unions, in their struggle to keep up the
      rate of wages and to reduce working hours, is that they tend to keep up and to raise the standard of life….
    </div>

    <div class="bqi2" id="ch04--244">
      The law of wages, then, is not one which draws a hard and fast line. It is not inexorable with certain limits.
      There is at every time (great depression excepted) for every trade a certain latitude within which the rate of

      3. <em id="ch04--254" class="calibre8">Development of class consciousness and organization.</em> We have seen that this was the
      motivation with which Marx and Engels started, apart from the economic problems just discussed. For example, in
      the aforementioned 1847 notes for a lecture on wages, after accepting the economists’ strictures on trade unions,
      Marx replies that all this is “correct only from their viewpoint.” He counterposes a socialist viewpoint which
      amounts to this:
    </div>

    <div class="bq" id="ch04--255">
      But they [trade unions] are the means for the unification of the working class, the preparation for the overthrow
      of the whole old society together with its class antagonisms. And from this standpoint the workers rightly laugh
      at the clever bourgeois pedants who count up what these civil wars [strikes] cost them in dead and wounded and in
      financial sacrifices. He who would beat the opponent will not discuss the cost of the war with him.<sup id="ch04--256" class="calibre13"><a id="ch04fn46" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch04--258" href="39_split_000.html#ch04fn46-r">46</a></sup>

      revolutionaries.
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="ch04--260">
      This fact comes close to the surface in what is perhaps Marx’s most effective polemic along these lines. This
      is—again—from the year 1853, in the midst of the strike wave and after Marx had been in England long <a id="page_96" class="calibre6"></a>enough to grasp the full meaning of a modern trade-union movement. It occurs in a <em id="ch04--262" class="calibre8">Tribune</em> article much of which is given over to long excerpts from Ernest Jones’s speech at a
      Chartist demonstration, exemplifying Jones’s strongest side, the side that endeared him to Marx, his role as a
      tribune of the people. But, as we have mentioned, this same Jones was also writing strong denunciations of
      trade-unionism in his press. And so in the first part of this <em id="ch04--263" class="calibre8">Tribune</em> article, Marx
      inserts a direct refutation of Jones’s views on trade unions without mentioning his name in this connection,
      merely politely stating that it applies to some socialists. I suggest it should be read as a summary of what Marx
      was in fact telling Jones and his similars around the Chartist movement:

      °°There exists a class of philanthropists, and even of socialists, who consider strikes as very mischievous to
      the interests of the “workingman himself” … I am, on the very contrary, convinced that the alternative rise and

      organization of industry, the indispensable means of holding up the spirit of the laboring classes, of combining
      them into one great association against the encroachments of the ruling class, and of preventing them from

      production. In a state of society founded upon the antagonism of classes, if we want to prevent Slavery in fact
      as well as in name, we must accept war. In order to rightly appreciate the value of strikes and combinations, we
      must not allow ourselves to be blinded by the apparent insignificance of their economical results, but hold,
      above all things, in view their moral and political consequences. Without the great alternative phases of
      dullness, prosperity, over-excitement, crisis and distress, which modern industry traverses in periodically
      recurring cycles, with the up and down of wages resulting from them, as with the constant warfare between masters
      and men closely corresponding with those variations in wages and profits, the working-classes of Great Britain,
      and of all Europe, would be a heart-broken, a weak-minded, a worn-out, unresisting mass, whose self-emancipation
      would prove as impossible as that of the slaves of Ancient Greece and Rome. We must not forget that strikes and

      waned away the false pretences on the part of the masters and the silly illusions on the part of the men. The war

      out that the mere existence of a trade-union movement had a meaning with relation to the state. This was
      particularly evident in the case of an authoritarian regime like Bismarck’s, and Marx took care to point it out
      precisely to the Lassallean socialists, the representatives of “Royal Prussian Government socialism.” When he
      publicly broke with this group, he lectured its chieftain Schweitzer that

    <div class="indent" id="ch04--317">
      The historical problem in the socialist movement was seeing the positive side of trade-unionism; there was never
      any lack of denunciation of the limitations, deficiencies, and faults of trade unions. The socialist orthodoxy
      that Marx overturned leaned exclusively on the latter. This pressure ensured that Marx and Engels scarcely ever
      took up the question without adequate reminders that the trade-union movement was not the end of the road for the
      working class.
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="ch04--318">
      To reflect this side of their views, we select three passages of special interest.
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="ch04--319">
      The first is a draft resolution on “Trade Unions—Their Past, Present and Future” which Marx drew up for the 1866
      congress of the International. At first blush it seems to be a very inclusive statement, for it contains the
      positive side too; but in fact Marx had to pull this punch. It was the first formal challenge in the
      International as a whole to the old anti-trade-union prejudices that were still rife, especially in the French
      section controlled by the Proudhonists. When Marx had drafted the Inaugural Address of the International two
      years before, any mention of trade unions had been a touchy point. Progress had been made, but now mention of
      strikes was the sore point.<a id="ch04en8-r" class="calibre6"></a><a class="nounder1" id="ch04--321" href="43.html#ch04en8">*</a>
      This document is therefore not a statement that fully reflects where Marx’s thinking was by 1866; it included
      only as much as Marx thought could be adopted at this juncture by the International congress.
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="ch04--322">
      With this reservation, it is worth citing almost complete, for it is the first international statement that
      effectively linked trade-unionism with socialism as part of a revolutionary program.

      struck on equitable terms, equitable even in the sense of a society which places the ownership of the material
      means of life and labour on one side and the vital productive energies on the opposite side. The only social
      power of the workmen is their number. The force of numbers, however, is broken by disunion. The disunion of the

      above the condition of mere slaves. The immediate object of Trades’ Unions was therefore confined to everyday
      necessities, to expediencies for the obstruction of the incessant encroachments of capital, in one word, to
      questions of wages and time of labour. This activity of the Trades’ Unions is not only legitimate, it is
      necessary. It cannot be dispensed with so long as the present system of production lasts. On the contrary, it
      must be generalised by the formation and the combination of Trades’ Unions throughout all countries. On the other
      hand, unconsciously to themselves, the Trades’ Unions were forming <em id="ch04--335" class="calibre8">centres of

      the Trades’ Unions are required for the guerilla fights between capital and labour, they are still more important

      downward movement, but not changing its direction; that they are applying palliatives, not curing the malady.
      They ought, therefore, not to be exclusively absorbed in these unavoidable guerilla fights incessantly springing

      “Fair Day’s Wage” watchword, and included discussion of trade-unionism’s limits. But a less known passage on the
      same subject may be of interest here. The question came up as a side issue in a polemic with the German economist
      Lujo Brentano in 1891, that is, after bourgeois economics had been convinced that there <em id="ch04--364" class="calibre8">was</em> a positive point to trade-unionism after all. Since the workers had not heeded their wise
      counsel to eschew union organization <a id="page_102" class="calibre6"></a>as a waste of time and substance, the economists had
      now turned around to use the reform-minded unions as a dead cat with which to belabor the socialists’ insistence
      on fundamental change. Whereas once socialists had had to explain that there was a point to workers’
      unionization, now Engels had to explain that trade unions could not solve all of the workers’ problems.

    <div class="bq" id="ch04--366">
      Herr Brentano’s continually repeated statement that workers’ protective legislation and trade-union organization
      lend themselves to the improvement of the condition of the working class is not in the least his own discovery.
      From <em id="ch04--367" class="calibre8">The Condition of the Working Class in England</em> and <em id="ch04--368" class="calibre8">The Poverty of
      Philosophy</em> to <em id="ch04--369" class="calibre8">Capital</em> and to my most recent writings, Marx and I have said this a
      hundred times, but with very considerable qualifications. Firstly, the favorable effects especially of workers’
      resistance organizations are limited to times of average and brisk trade; in periods of stagnation and crisis
      they regularly bog down. Herr Brentano’s assertion that they “are able to paralyze the disastrous effects of the
      reserve army” is ridiculous bombast. And secondly—aside from other, less important qualifications—neither the
      protection given by legislation nor the resistance of the unions abolishes the main thing that has to be
      eliminated: the capital-labor relationship, which the antagonism between the capitalist class and the
      wage-working class always generates anew. The mass of wage-workers remain condemned to life-long wage-labor, the
      gulf between them and the capitalists becomes ever deeper and wider, the more modern large-scale industry takes
      over all branches of production. But since Herr Brentano would like to make the wage-slaves into <em id="ch04--370" class="calibre8">contented</em> wage-slaves, he has to enormously overstate the advantageous effects of labor
      protective laws, trade-union resistance, social-patchwork legislation, etc.; and since we are so misguided as to

      These and similar explanations are pitched in terms of any trade union, any resistance organization limited to
      economic issues, therefore even the best unions, even the best possible ones. But precisely because Marx took a
      positive stand for trade-unionism, it became necessary to differentiate between better and worse, unlike the
      sectarians who needed only to damn them all. Marx had to concern himself with the issues of policy and program
      inside the trade-union movement, like any other supporter.

    <div class="indent" id="ch04--378">
      The kind of trade-unionism that Marx opposed had been strongly enough criticized in the International resolution
      of 1866: the kind that systematically kept its efforts “narrow and selfish” in the interest of specially favored
      sectors and enclaves of the working class; the kind that remained “too exclusively bent upon the local and
      immediate struggles with capital,” and increasingly detested struggles of any sort; above all, the kind that
      rejected political involvement and repudiated any program of “complete emancipation” as being an interference
      with its own pursuit of narrow privileges. This kind of unionism has been given various labels, such as
      “pure-and-simple unionism.” Its central characteristic is that it regards the trade union as merely a haggler
      over the sale of labor power within the high walls of the capitalist system, a merchant of labor. From this point
      of view, business unionism is an apt description, though its use postdates Marx. (Engels often called it simply
      “conservative” unionism, as we shall see.)<sup id="ch04--379" class="calibre13"><a id="ch04fn62" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch04--381" href="39_split_000.html#ch04fn62-r">62</a></sup>

    <div class="indent" id="ch04--382">
      By the mid-1870s, the International dead, the English trade unions were in full flight to the most philistine
      forms of business unionism. “For a number of years past,” Engels wrote to his German comrades in 1879, “the
      English working-class movement has been hopelessly describing a narrow circle of strikes for higher wages and
      shorter hours, not, however, as an expedient or means of propaganda and organization but as the ultimate aim.” It
      is divided into Tories and Liberals. “One can speak here of a labor movement only insofar as strikes take place
      here which, whether they are won or not, do not get the movement one step further.” He advised the party press:
      “No attempt should be made to conceal the fact that at present no real labor movement in the Continental sense
      exists here …”<sup id="ch04--383" class="calibre13"><a id="ch04fn63" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch04--385" href="39_split_000.html#ch04fn63-r">63</a></sup> A labor movement “in the Continental sense” meant a movement that took itself

      Business unionism needed little theory; bourgeois political economy provided more than enough for its purposes.

    <div class="indent" id="ch04--417">
      Engels’ reference to “privileged workers” reflects a long-standing problem occupying the attention of socialists
      concerned with the trade-union movement. The guild-like and job-trust aspects and forms of conservative
      trade-unionism did indeed suggest the pattern of privileged enclaves of better-off workers inside the bourgeois
      order; and this had fed the lively suspicion of the early socialists that trade-unionism was an evil to be
      fought.

      whole trades and sectors of the class. This gave rise to terms like <em id="ch04--423" class="calibre8">aristocracy of labor</em>,
      no doubt first as a metaphor.<sup id="ch04--424" class="calibre13"><a id="ch04fn72" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch04--426" href="39_split_000.html#ch04fn72-r">72</a></sup>

      There was a mutually reinforcing tendency for the skilled trades to be more easily organized, and for the
      unionized trades to enforce higher wages. Therefore there was a tendency for trade-unionist narrowness and
      trade-union successes to be linked by critics of the movement, themselves taking a narrow view. Thus, in a key
      article opposing trade unions per se, Ernest Jones, in the name of the revolutionary wing of Chartism, also
      denounced the “aristocracy of labor”:

      While Marx disagreed with Jones’s blanket opposition to trade-unionism, it was in this period of the early 1850s
      that he regarded Jones, for all his defects, as the best representative of left Chartism. Marx’s first use of the
      “aristocracy” figure comes along in 1850 in the context of a passage on Chartism. Reviewing the past period, he
      notes that the Chartist organization is declining:

      The petty-bourgeois who still belong to the party, allied with the aristocracy of the workers, form a purely

      unionism and adopted the self-protective devices of the job trust, deepening the gulf between themselves and
      underpaid unskilled labor, the descriptive figure took on more importance. From the early 1870s on, the

      There soon followed a public falling-out with the trade-union leaders collaborating with Marx in the

      Visiting America in 1888, Engels replied to an interview question about English socialism in the same spirit,
      emphasizing the contrast between “the proletarian consciousness of the <em id="ch04--475" class="calibre8">masses</em>” and the
      workers’ organizations which, “like the aristocracy of the workers in general, go along with Gladstone and the
      liberal bourgeoisie.” He added that “The official workers’ organizations, the °Trade-Unions,° which here and
      there are threatening to become reactionary,” are hobbling behind in the rearguard.<sup id="ch04--476" class="calibre13"><a id="ch04fn82" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch04--478" href="39_split_000.html#ch04fn82-r">82</a></sup>

    <div class="indent" id="ch04--482">
      It is the pattern in all countries that, as soon as the bourgeoisie reconciles itself to the fact that
      trade-unionism is here to stay, it ceases to denounce the institution as a subversive evil that has to be rooted
      out with fire and sword in order to defend God, country, and motherhood, and turns instead to the next line of
      defense: domesticating the unions, housebreaking them, and fitting them into the national family as one of the
      tame cats.
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="ch04--483">
      In an essay comparing conditions in 1885 with the old days of 1845, <a id="page_109" class="calibre6"></a>Engels pointed to this
      change. The manufacturers were maturer and wiser about unions, and also aware of how badly their “great Liberal
      Party” needed workingmen’s votes.
    </div>

    <div class="bq" id="ch04--485">
      Trades Unions, lately considered inventions of the devil himself, were now petted and patronised as perfectly
      legitimate institutions and as useful means of spreading sound economical doctrines amongst the workers. Even
      strikes, than which nothing had been more nefarious up to 1848, were now gradually found out to be occasionally
      very useful, especially when provoked by the masters themselves, at their own time.<sup id="ch04--486" class="calibre13"><a id="ch04fn83" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch04--488" href="39_split_000.html#ch04fn83-r">83</a></sup>
    </div>

    <div class="noindent" id="ch04--489">
      In fact, by this time the manufacturers had virtually taken over the program of the Chartists. What, in a
      different social context, had been the program of revolutionaries was now not only respectable but a necessity
      for bourgeois advance.
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="ch04--490">
      A factor making this possible (as Engels pointed out in an 1892 preface to his old book of 1845) was the great
      advance in industrial development and profits. The <em id="ch04--491" class="calibre8">scale</em> of profits had changed. The
      really big capitalists no longer found it worthwhile to practice “petty thefts upon the workpeople” in order to
      eke out their takings, and so became “apparently moralized.” It was only the petty tradesmen who had to pick up a
      penny here and there in that way. Thus a number of reforms became possible, including the Ten Hours Bill.
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="ch04--492">
      But these very reforms—which seemed to be concessions to the working class, and were so in part—were tied to
      another process taking place in the capitalist structure. Their effect operated “in favor of the giant capitalist
      in his competition with his less favored brother.” The big capitalists even began
    </div>

    <div class="bq" id="ch04--493">
      to discover in strikes—at opportune times—a powerful means to serve their own ends. The largest manufacturers,
      formerly the leaders of the war against the working class, were now the foremost to preach peace and harmony. And
      for a very good reason. The fact is that all these concessions to justice and philanthropy were nothing else but
      means to accelerate the concentration of capital in the hands of the few, for whom the niggardly extra extortions
      of former years had lost all importance and had become actual nuisances; and to crush all the quicker and all the
      safer their smaller competitors, who could not make both ends meet without such perquisites.<sup id="ch04--494" class="calibre13"><a id="ch04fn84" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch04--496" href="39_split_000.html#ch04fn84-r">84</a></sup>

    <div class="noindent" id="ch04--497">
      The bigger the enterprise, the greater was the loss and inconvenience of <a id="page_110" class="calibre6"></a>labor conflicts,
      hence the greater the desire to avoid “unnecessary squabbles.” All this explains why a huge corporation can often
      exhibit an apparently more enlightened labor policy than a twopenny capitalist scrabbling for a living in a
      sweatshop; but the other side of this meant that, when conflict does break out, it tends more rapidly to assume
      the proportions of civil war.
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="ch04--499">
      This relationship could go on most smoothly when big capital was dealing with relatively limited sections of
      privileged workers, and so the pattern reinforced tendencies toward “aristocratic” stratification in the
      proletariat—as long as capital could afford it.

      By the 1880s the English union movement was covered over with a bureaucratic crust that looked invincible, even
      though—or because—only some ten percent of the working class were organized. Engels’ interest lay in looking

      with the class, nor the leaders with the labor movement as such, nor its bour-geoisified bureaucrats with the

      won a resounding victory. Eleanor Marx became one of the leaders of the resultant Gas Workers and General
      Laborers Union, which was in the vanguard of the “New Unionism.” The Dockworkers Union was the next and decisive

      … the movement spreads and seizes one layer of the workers after another. It has now shaken out of their torpor

      The East End, shaking off misery and despair, “has returned to life, and has become the home of what is called
      the ‘New Unionism,’ that is to say, of the organization of the great mass of ‘unskilled’ workers.” This unionism
      is essentially different, for it does not take the wage system as fixed and given, and its leaders are
      socialists.

      … the masses, whose adhesion gave them strength, were rough, neglected, looked down upon by the working-class

      entirely free from the inherited “respectable” bourgeois prejudices which hampered the brains of the better
      situated “old” Unionists. And thus we see now these new Unions taking the lead of the working-class movement
      generally, and more and more taking in tow the rich and proud “old” Unions.<sup id="ch04--550" class="calibre13"><a id="ch04fn94" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch04--552" href="39_split_000.html#ch04fn94-r">94</a></sup>

      This upheaval was important to Engels not because it meant that the revolution was around the corner—he was not
      <em id="ch04--554" class="calibre8">that</em> sanguine—but because it showed the irrepressible class forces at work. In fact, the
      modern labor and socialist movement dates from this development. It was a question of the direction of the
      movement:

      In an article for the German press on the 1890 May Day celebration in London, Engels went over many of the ideas
      we have been quoting <a id="page_113" class="calibre6"></a>from his correspondence; in addition there was special emphasis on the
      new unions’ rejection of the old guild attitudes:
    </div>

    <div class="bq" id="ch04--563">
      The old ones [trade unions], which admit none but “skilled” workers, are exclusive; they bar all workers who have
      not been trained according to the statutes of the guild concerned, and thereby even expose themselves to
      competition from those not in the guild; they are rich, but the richer they become, the more they degenerate into
      mere sick-funds and burial clubs; they are conservative and they steer clear above all of that “…” socialism, as
      far and as long as they can. The new “unskilled” unions, on the other hand, admit <em id="ch04--564" class="calibre8">every</em>
      fellow-worker; they are essentially, and the Gas Workers even exclusively, strike unions and strike
      funds.<sup id="ch04--565" class="calibre13"><a id="ch04fn96" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch04--567" href="39_split_000.html#ch04fn96-r">96</a></sup>

      <a id="page_114" class="calibre6"></a>The upheaval had a “stunning effect” on the bourgeoisie and the general public, commented
      Engels in the same letter. No doubt it especially stunned authorities on the labor movement. It was not only the
      socialist sectarians who were incapable of grasping the main feature of the trade-union movement, namely, the
      fact that here in the elementary class organization of the proletariat was an irrepressible reservoir of
      elemental class struggle.
