    <div class="indent" id="ch08--2">
      Although the <em id="ch08--3" class="calibre8">Communist Manifesto</em> was reticent on a number of programmatic issues, it stated
      very positively that “the bourgeois revolution in Germany will be but the prelude to an immediately following
      proletarian revolution,” and it repeatedly made clear that the coming revolution was expected to move
      uninterruptedly from the bourgeois stage into an antibourgeois phase.<sup id="ch08--4" class="calibre13"><a id="ch08fn1" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch08--6" href="39_split_000.html#ch08fn1-r">1</a></sup> This was a very widespread,
      though by no means unanimous, view among the radicals of the time; and it had a tag: the “revolution in
      permanence,” or permanent revolution. The idea figures much more prominently than the term.
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="ch08--7">
      Like “dictatorship of the proletariat,” this term is now so thoroughly wrapped in later controversies that one
      must make a strenuous effort to see what it meant in 1848, even though (or because) what it meant then was quite
      simple and uncomplicated. In addition, for English-speaking people there is an extra difficulty: the word <em id="ch08--8" class="calibre8">permanent</em> in this expression retains its specifically French and Latin meaning. It does not mean
      perpetual or never stopping, but rather <em id="ch08--9" class="calibre8">continuing</em>, <em id="ch08--10" class="calibre8">uninterrupted.</em>

      A <em id="ch08--14" class="calibre8">revolution in permanence</em> describes a situation in which there is more than one phase or

      Those of your readers who, having read my letters on German Revolution and Counter-Revolution, written for
      <em id="ch08--24" class="calibre8">The Tribune</em> some two years ago, desire to have an immediate intuition of it, will do well
      to inspect the picture by Mr. <em id="ch08--25" class="calibre8">Hasenclever</em>, now being exhibited in the New-York Crystal
      Palace, representing the presentation of a workingmen’s petition to the magistrates of Düsseldorf in 1848. What
      the writer could only analyze, the eminent painter has reproduced in its dramatic vitality.

      Marx’s reference is to the series of articles, now usually called <em id="ch08--27" class="calibre8">Revolution and
      Counterrevolution in Germany</em>, which was drafted by Engels. The picture presents a dramatic interplay between
      the scene in the foreground—the city burghers on the right, grouped around the council table with an interesting
      similarity to the Last Supper; the workers’ delegation on the left, obviously far from united but led by a
      staunch spokesperson—and the partially seen revolutionary demonstration in the marketplace outside, under a
      turbulent sky.

    <div class="noindent" id="ch08--28">
      <a id="page_203" class="calibre6"></a>liberation and a social-revolutionary stage. (Both cases apply to the revolution of 1848.)
      The term implies that the movement of revolution goes on from one phase to the next with no lasting interruption,
      in a continuous process, without halting for a historical period in which one stage stabilizes itself. There may
      be pauses, but no stabilization. The second stage is seen as emerging more or less organically out of the first.
      It is this relationship that Marx and Engels have been emphasizing, in different ways, well before the outbreak
      of the revolution.
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="ch08--30">
      In all likelihood, the term <em id="ch08--31" class="calibre8">permanent revolution</em> came out of the literature of the French
      Revolution; certainly this was true of the concept, or consciousness of the pattern, whatever term was actually
      used. It was the escalation of the French Revolution from the tentative anti-absolutist protests of the Estates
      General in May 1789 to the left-wing club movement of 1793, passing through a series of ascendant political
      currents, that was the historical model.
    </div>

    <div class="bqi" id="ch08--32">
      In the first French Revolution the rule of the <em id="ch08--33" class="calibre8">Constitutionalists</em> is followed by the rule
      of the <em id="ch08--34" class="calibre8">Girondins</em> and the rule of the <em id="ch08--35" class="calibre8">Girondins</em> by the rule of the
      <em id="ch08--36" class="calibre8">Jacobins.</em> Each of these parties relies on the more progressive parties for support. As
      soon as it has brought the revolution far enough to be unable to follow it further, still less to go ahead of it,
      it is thrust aside by the bolder ally that stands behind it and sent to the guillotine. The revolution thus moves
      along an ascending line.<sup id="ch08--37" class="calibre13"><a id="ch08fn4" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch08--39" href="39_split_000.html#ch08fn4-r">4</a></sup>
    </div>

    <div class="noindent" id="ch08--40">
      So Marx explained in <em id="ch08--41" class="calibre8">The Eighteenth Brumaire</em>, without putting a label on the ascending
      line. Engels likewise made the linkage more than once.<sup id="ch08--42" class="calibre13"><a id="ch08fn5" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch08--44" href="39_split_000.html#ch08fn5-r">5</a></sup>
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="ch08--45">
      This was the pattern of permanent revolution in the actual course of the French Revolution. The term could also
      be applied to the political outlook of the militants to the left of the Jacobins’ main body—Marat and especially
      the sans-culotte spokesmen called the Enrages—who sought to push the revolution beyond the bounds of bourgeois
      interests into a further stage dimly seen as a social transformation penetrating more deeply into the class
      structure. The idea was to keep the revolution going farther: ongoing, hence (with a Gallic accent) <em id="ch08--46" class="calibre8">permanent.</em> As more and more radical strata of the revolutionary population came to dominate the
      scene, finally the springs of society, overloaded by the strain, snapped back to make the revolution conform to
      the historical possibilities.

    <div class="indent" id="ch08--47">
      In the first two times that Marx used the term <em id="ch08--48" class="calibre8">permanent revolution</em>, <a id="page_204" class="calibre6"></a>in 1843 and 1844 (and no prior uses by anyone else are known), the context was clearly the French
      Revolution.<a id="ch08en2-r" class="calibre6"></a><a class="nounder1" id="ch08--51" href="43.html#ch08en2">*</a>
    </div>

    <h3 class="h2" id="ch08lev1">1. THE TERM IN 1848</h3>

    <div class="indent" id="ch08--53">
      When we first meet <em id="ch08--54" class="calibre8">permanent revolution</em> in 1848, it is not simply a historical reference
      but a current programmatic slogan. But it is clearly not a slogan distinctive of the extreme left, let alone of
      Marx and Engels alone, but rather one understood to be widely accepted by the Democracy, that is, by everyone to
      the left of the bourgeois republicans.
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="ch08--55">
      Engels, in an unpublished article about the December 10 election in France, is discussing the split between the
      two wings of the pre-February “revolutionary Democracy” or “Socialist-Democratic party.” There is a right wing,
      representing the petty-bourgeois radicals, which is running Ledru-Rollin, and a left wing, representing the
      “socialist workers,” which is running Raspail. What is the difference between them?
    </div>

    <div class="bqi" id="ch08--56">
      Ask the papers of the Montagnards, <em id="ch08--57" class="calibre8">La Reforme</em>, <em id="ch08--58" class="calibre8">La Revolution</em> [the
      right wing], and they will tell you that they themselves cannot figure it out; that the Socialists [the left
      wing] put forward literally the same program—the permanent revolution, progressive tax and inheritance tax,
      organization of labor—that the Mountain has put forward; that absolutely no quarrel over principles exists
      …<sup id="ch08--59" class="calibre13"><a id="ch08fn6" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch08--61" href="39_split_000.html#ch08fn6-r">6</a></sup>
    </div>

    <div class="noindent" id="ch08--62">
      Clearly this “permanent revolution” is not some extreme Blanquist invention but figures casually as one of the
      many socialistic phrases that are on the lips of anyone aspiring to be thought leftish.
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="ch08--63">
      This will not be surprising if we forget modern marxological myths and focus on the political issues of 1848. A
      programmatic demarcation exists between two camps that come forward as different varieties of republicanism. On
      the right are the “pure” republicans, that is, those who want a purely bourgeois republic. On the left are the
      “social <a id="page_205" class="calibre6"></a>republicans,” the advocates of the “Social Republic,” or “Social and Democratic
      Republic,” that is, a republic that undertakes social, not merely political, measures answering the needs of the
      working masses; a republic that is therefore expected to go beyond the class interests of the bourgeoisie,
      necessarily coming into conflict with the bourgeoisie and its political representatives. This means carrying
      through the revolution from its merely political phase (defeat of the monarchist-aristocratic state) to the
      “social” phase. This is what gives it its antibourgeois bite.
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="ch08--65">
      The term <em id="ch08--66" class="calibre8">permanent revolution</em> turns up so casually because it is only a way of asserting
      the aim of the Social Republic beyond the bounds of such republican institutions as would satisfy the
      bourgeoisie. What the Ledru-Rollin radicals of the Montagnard wing are saying is simply this: <em id="ch08--67" class="calibre8">We too are in favor of going on to the Social Republic</em>, <em id="ch08--68" class="calibre8">we are not merely for
      bourgeois republicanism;</em> or in more modern language: <em id="ch08--69" class="calibre8">We claim to be for socialism</em>,
      <em id="ch08--70" class="calibre8">not simply bourgeois democracy.</em> And Engels’ comment was: <em id="ch08--71" class="calibre8">That’s what
      they say but they don’t mean it in action—</em>as was eventually proved, when it was only the revolutionary left
      that continued to advocate pushing beyond the bounds of bourgeois democracy, that is, to advocate the permanence
      of the revolution. It was at this later point that permanent revolution became an “extremist” position.
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="ch08--72">
      This interpretation is confirmed by two other references to permanent revolution that crop up in 1849.
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="ch08--73">
      In an article published in January, Engels is enthusiastic about the Hungarian uprising:
    </div>

    <div class="bq" id="ch08--74">
      … we again find the uprising en masse, national manufacture of weapons, assignats, short shrift to anyone
      obstructing the revolutionary movement, the revolution in permanence—in short, all the main features of the
      glorious year 1793 …<sup id="ch08--75" class="calibre13"><a id="ch08fn7" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch08--77" href="39_split_000.html#ch08fn7-r">7</a></sup>
    </div>

    <div class="noindent" id="ch08--78">
      This bridges the gap between permanent revolution as historical reference and as contemporaneous revolutionary
      fact.
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="ch08--79">
      In July, during the dispersal after the defeat of the revolution, Engels writes from Switzerland to Jenny Marx,
      assuring her that if Marx is unsafe in Paris he would be “entirely safe here in Vaud. Even the government calls
      itself red <em id="ch08--80" class="calibre8">and partisan de la revolution permanente.</em> In Geneva, it’s the same.”<sup id="ch08--81" class="calibre13"><a id="ch08fn8" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch08--83" href="39_split_000.html#ch08fn8-r">8</a></sup> These two
      cantons of French Switzerland were known as the most progressive in the country,<sup id="ch08--84" class="calibre13"><a id="ch08fn9" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch08--86" href="39_split_000.html#ch08fn9-r">9</a></sup> but their leaders were <a id="page_206" class="calibre6"></a>not even socialists, let alone extreme revolutionaries. James Fazy, the Bonapartist “dictator of
      Geneva” (as Marx called him), was a Radical party demagogue who had no objection to wielding vaguely radical
      phrases that were currently fashionable.<sup id="ch08--88" class="calibre13"><a id="ch08fn10" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch08--90" href="39_split_000.html#ch08fn10-r">10</a></sup> It would seem that <em id="ch08--91" class="calibre8">permanent revolution</em> was one of
      these.
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="ch08--92">
      When Engels wrote about this period thirty-five years later, the term still came to his pen in connection with
      the French Revolution. We of the <em id="ch08--93" class="calibre8">Neue Rheinische Zeitung</em>, he related, “unconsciously
      imitated the great model” set by Marat in his paper <em id="ch08--94" class="calibre8">L’Ami du Peuple</em>, for “he, like us, did
      not want the revolution declared finished but continued in permanence.” This remark followed right after a good
      summary of the concept of permanent revolution:
    </div>

    <div class="bq" id="ch08--95">
      To us, February and March [the Paris and Berlin uprisings in 1848] could have had the significance of a real
      revolution only if they had not been the conclusion but, on the contrary, the starting point of along
      revolutionary movement in which, as in the Great French Revolution, the people would have developed further
      through its own struggles and the parties become more and more sharply differentiated until they had coincided
      entirely with the great classes, bourgeoisie, petty-bourgeoisie and proletariat, and in which the separate
      positions would have been won one after another by the proletariat in a series of battles.<sup id="ch08--96" class="calibre13"><a id="ch08fn11" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch08--98" href="39_split_000.html#ch08fn11-r">11</a></sup>
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="ch08--99">
      It should be plain that if this contemporaneous meaning of the term is understood, there is little sense to the
      myth that has Marx and Engels repudiating the permanent revolution concept after 1850. The revolution of 1848 was
      just getting under way when Marx made a speech including these words: “The Jacobin of 1793 has become the
      Communist of our day.”<sup id="ch08--100" class="calibre13"><a id="ch08fn12" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch08--102" href="39_split_000.html#ch08fn12-r">12</a></sup> He was not portraying himself as merely a time-transplanted Jacobin. He was
      saying the same thing that Engels had already written more than once: <em id="ch08--103" class="calibre8">today revolutionary
      Democracy means Communism.</em>
    </div>

    <h3 class="h2" id="ch08lev2"><a id="page_207" class="calibre15"></a>2. ALTERNATIVES TO PERMANENT REVOLUTION</h3>

    <div class="indent" id="ch08--106">
      Although the phrase <em id="ch08--107" class="calibre8">permanent revolution</em> was widely accepted, not every advocate of the
      Social Republic held a permanent revolution perspective. For present purposes, here are two types of
      contemporaneous radicals who rejected this outlook—for opposite reasons—whether or not the phrase was used.
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="ch08--108">
      First, there was the radical who advocated the Social Republic in some sense for some time in the future, but who
      expected the liberal bourgeoisie to come to power first for a whole historical period. In Marx’s book these were
      the petty-bourgeois Radical Democrats, standing on the left wing of bourgeois republicanism. What this political
      type advocated was halting the revolution at the bourgeois-democratic phase.
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="ch08--109">
      Typical of this current were the French radicals of Ledru-Rollin’s social-democratic school (who were recorded by
      Engels as actually accepting permanent revolution as a slogan or catchword). In their case they left no doubt of
      their real politics because they had the misfortune of temporarily coming to power. Although they continued to
      use socialistic language, they set the achievement of a bourgeois-democratic republic as their acceptable goal
      for the period, confining themselves to prodding the bourgeoisie into doing its liberal duty. They therefore
      figured prominently in Marx’s subsequent analysis, <em id="ch08--110" class="calibre8">The Class Struggles in France.</em><sup id="ch08--111" class="calibre13"><a id="ch08fn13" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch08--113" href="39_split_000.html#ch08fn13-r">13</a></sup>
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="ch08--114">
      A variant on this theme was represented by one Andreas Gottschalk, who for a while opposed Marx’s tendency inside
      the Cologne workers’ movement. Gottschalk was a philanthropic physician to the poor who had become a leader of
      the Cologne Workers Association before Marx arrived, and who completely discredited himself in that organization
      in the course of the next year. His politics was essentially that of the “True Socialists,” spiced with demagogic
      use of radical catchwords, sometimes oscillating between an opportunistic acceptance of democratic revolution as
      the goal, and a sectarian rejection of anything outside the proletarian bailiwick (which he viewed as his fief).
      But for the most part his politics oriented to the “red monarchy” (the “Social Monarchy”), that is, dependence on
      the old state to do the workers good. In April 1849 the Workers Association denounced his “despotic mentality
      [which] violates the most elementary democratic principles,” and particularly attacked his “red monarchy”
      outlook.<sup id="ch08--115" class="calibre13"><a id="ch08fn14" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch08--117" href="39_split_000.html#ch08fn14-r">14</a></sup>
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="ch08--118">
      What Gottschalk’s politics never included was precisely the permanent <a id="page_208" class="calibre6"></a>revolution concept,
      whether he was supporting “red” monarchism against bourgeois constitutionalism or boycotting support of
      Democratic candidates in the name of <em id="ch08--120" class="calibre8">ouvriériste</em> isolation. Yet he, too, seems to have
      played with the phrase <em id="ch08--121" class="calibre8">permanent revolution</em>, like the French radicals.<a id="ch08en3-r" class="calibre6"></a><a class="nounder1" id="ch08--123" href="43.html#ch08en3">*</a>
    </div>

    <div class="indentb" id="ch08--124">
      Second: there was a way of rejecting the permanent revolution perspective that was the opposite of that of the
      petty-bourgeois radicals, the other side of the coin. This was to deny the need or possibility of a bourgeois
      revolution even for the first stage of the revolutionary process; that is, to insist that the revolution must
      <em id="ch08--125" class="calibre8">begin</em> as a communist revolution, bypassing the Democratic phase altogether. This was
      precisely one difference between the Blanquist and the Marxist approaches to the problem, as Spitzer explains:
    </div>

    <div class="alpha-list" id="ch08--126">
      … while Marx and his successors were concerned with transforming a middle-class [bourgeois] revolution, Blanqui
      was attempting, when all of the conditions for this revolution were present, to anticipate it.
    </div>

    <div class="bqi2" id="ch08--127">
      This crucial aspect of his political thought is expressed in these sentences: “if socialism is not its [the
      revolution’s] author it will not be its master. It must make it, not allow it to be made. The morrow belongs only
      to the victor.” In short, for a revolution to end in socialism, it had to be begun by socialists.<sup id="ch08--128" class="calibre13"><a id="ch08fn19" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch08--130" href="39_split_000.html#ch08fn19-r">19</a></sup>
    </div>

    <div class="noindentt" id="ch08--131">
      Blanqui’s aim was to forestall the bourgeois revolution, not to drive through it onward to socialism.
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="ch08--132">
      The contrast was strongly made by Engels in 1852, writing on the revolution in Germany. It was the
      Willich-Schapper group that exemplified the Blanquist type of adventurism he is discussing:
    </div>

    <div class="bq" id="ch08--133">
      <a id="page_209" class="calibre6"></a>°° [The Marxist] party never imagined itself capable of producing, at any time and at its
      pleasure, that revolution which was to carry its ideas into practice. … The practical revolutionary experience of
      1848-49 confirmed the reasonings of theory, which led to the conclusion that the democracy of the petty traders
      must first have its turn, before the Communist working class could hope to permanently establish itself in power
      and destroy that system of wages-slavery which keeps it under the yoke of the bourgeoisie. Thus the secret
      organization of the Communists could not have the direct purpose of upsetting the <em id="ch08--135" class="calibre8">present</em>
      governments of Germany. Being formed to upset not these, but the insurrectionary government [of the bourgeoisie],
      which is sooner or later to follow them, its members might, and certainly would, individually lend an active hand
      to a revolutionary movement against the present status quo in its time; but the <em id="ch08--136" class="calibre8">preparation</em> of such a movement, otherwise than by secret spreading of Communist opinions by the
      masses, could not be the object of the Association.
    </div>

      In this explanation Engels counterposed the basic view of permanent revolution to the traditional Blanquist
      strategy. Blanquism was one type of radicalism that did not want to continue uninterruptedly (that is, in
      permanence) from the bourgeois to the proletarian revolution, but rather wanted to jump over the former.

    <h3 class="h2" id="ch08lev3">3. FIRST RESPONSE TO THE REVOLUTION</h3>

    <div class="indent" id="ch08--144">
      Revolutionary theories are tested in revolution. The first such laboratory for Marx and Engels was the revolution
      of 1848-1849. For thirteen months they actively participated in it in Germany, while following its vicissitudes
      from day to day in the adjoining countries. These thirteen months were the real crucible of the largest portion
      of the revolutionary theory which they were going to develop over the next decades, until another revolution
      supervened in 1871.<a id="ch08en4-r" class="calibre6"></a><a class="nounder1" id="ch08--146" href="43.html#ch08en4">*</a>

    <div class="indent" id="ch08--147">
      <a id="page_210" class="calibre6"></a>If Engels was able to say some years later (in the passage just quoted) that “The practical
      revolutionary experience of 1848-49 confirmed the reasonings of theory,” this was true only with an important
      qualification: the practical experience also changed and refashioned their theoretical views.
    </div>

    <div class="indentb" id="ch08--149">
      As the revolution of 1848 gets under way before hitting Germany, it is important to note two articles published
      by Engels in which the emphasis is on the executioner waiting at the door, that is, on the proletarian revolution
      standing behind the bourgeoisie. An article published on February 20 says that the predicted triumph of the
      bourgeoisie is being fulfilled by the overthrow of three absolute monarchies in two weeks (Denmark, Naples,
      Sardinia—the Paris uprising is two days ahead).
    </div>

    <div class="alpha-list" id="ch08--150">
      The Germans are the last because their revolution will be altogether different from the Sicilian revolution [that
      is, not simply bourgeois]. The German bourgeois and philistines know very well that behind them stands a
      proletariat which is growing daily and which, on the day after the revolution, will present quite different
      demands than they themselves would like. The German bourgeois and philistines therefore behave in a cowardly,
      indecisive, vacillating way; they fear a collision no less than they fear the government.

    <div class="indent" id="ch08--159">
      A week later, Engels celebrates the February revolution in Paris by emphasizing even more strongly the
      perspective of the coming <em id="ch08--160" class="calibre8">proletarian</em> revolution. The workers were “the <em id="ch08--161" class="calibre8">only</em> ones who erected barricades” and fought aggressively. They “were not inclined to fight
      merely for” the big bourgeoisie. “They continued the struggle” even while the bourgeois were celebrating on the
      boulevards.

    <div class="bqi" id="ch08--162">
      The bourgeoisie has made its revolution; it has overthrown Guizot and with him the exclusive rule of the big

    <h3 class="h2" id="ch08lev4">4. THE LINE OF THE <em id="ch08--173" class="calibre17">N.R.Z.</em></h3>

    <div class="indent" id="ch08--174">
      When a mid-March uprising in Berlin hurled Germany into the revolution, Marx and Engels together with a group of
      close comrades went to Cologne, the scene of Marx’s first political activity and still the most advanced center
      of the Rhineland. There on June 1 they launched a daily paper called the <em id="ch08--175" class="calibre8">Neue Rheinische
      Zeitung</em>, which became the extreme left-wing organ of the revolution.
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="ch08--176">
      Its subtitle was “<em id="ch08--177" class="calibre8">Organ der Demokratie.</em>” This is usually translated as “Organ of
      Democracy,” and grossly misinterpreted. The paper was the “Organ of <em id="ch08--178" class="calibre8">the Democracy</em>” in the
      sense that Marx had already worked out. And as we have seen, “the Democracy” did not include the bourgeoisie.
      From the beginning the <em id="ch08--179" class="calibre8">N.R.Z.</em> acted as the organ of the <a id="page_212" class="calibre6"></a>Democratic
      bloc of lower classes that had been envisaged before the revolution, and it was directed against the liberal
      bourgeoisie in power, as represented by the Camphausen and Hansemann ministries.
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="ch08--181">
      A programmatic statement by Marx in the second issue not only arrayed it against the “gentlemen” of the
      “circumspect and moderate bourgeoisie” but also made clear that <em id="ch08--182" class="calibre8">this</em> organ of the
      Democracy looked even on the “Democratic party” itself with a dubious eye.<a id="ch08en5-r" class="calibre6"></a><a class="nounder1" id="ch08--184" href="43.html#ch08en5">*</a> With regard to the former, Marx wrote: the bourgeois
      liberals in power want to limit the movement to carrying out only “their own political system”; they stick at a
      middle-of-the-road position between the Democratic party on the left and the absolutists on the right. While they
      are progressive with relation to the absolutist regime, they are “reactionary—as against the Democracy.”
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="ch08--185">
      And with regard to the Democratic party: we warn it (wrote Marx) against its illusions on the situation; so far
      it has proclaimed principles but not acted on behalf of them.
    </div>

    <div class="bqi" id="ch08--186">
      We must squarely warn against those hypocritical friends who declare that they agree with the principle, to be
      sure, but doubt that it can be carried out, since the world is not yet ripe for it … These people are
      dangerous.<sup id="ch08--187" class="calibre13"><a id="ch08fn25" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch08--189" href="39_split_000.html#ch08fn25-r">25</a></sup>
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="ch08--190">
      The <em id="ch08--191" class="calibre8">N.R.Z.</em>, as the political center for Marx’s operation, therefore assumed a double
      task: mobilizing the proletariat, small peasantry, and <a id="page_213" class="calibre6"></a>petty-bourgeois Democrats (the bloc
      of the Democracy) against bourgeois liberalism, against the party of the bourgeoisie; and functioning as the
      extreme left wing of the Democracy itself.
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="ch08--193">
      As an article by Engels later in the year said:
    </div>

    <div class="bqi" id="ch08--194">
      We have never coveted the honor of being an organ of any parliamentary left. On the contrary, with respect to the
      often disparate elements out of which the Democratic party in Germany was formed, we have considered it
      imperatively necessary to keep a sharp eye on no one more closely than on the Democrats.<sup id="ch08--195" class="calibre13"><a id="ch08fn26" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch08--197" href="39_split_000.html#ch08fn26-r">26</a></sup>
    </div>

    <div class="noindent" id="ch08--198">
      Six months after that, Marx remarked in an article that “The March revolution in Berlin, that weak echo of the
      revolution in Vienna, never filled us with enthusiasm,” that is, not for the elements that led it and their
      limited aims.<sup id="ch08--199" class="calibre13"><a id="ch08fn27" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch08--201" href="39_split_000.html#ch08fn27-r">27</a></sup> And about four decades later, Engels summarized it this way:
    </div>

    <div class="bq" id="ch08--202">
      °°When we returned to Germany in Spring 1848, we joined the Democratic Party as the only possible means of
      gaining the ear of the working class; we were the most advanced wing of that party, but still a wing of it. … I
      think all our practice has shown that it is possible to work along with the general movement of the working class
      at every one of its stages without giving up or hiding our own distinct position and even organisation.<sup id="ch08--203" class="calibre13"><a id="ch08fn28" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch08--205" href="39_split_000.html#ch08fn28-r">28</a></sup>
    </div>

    <div class="noindent" id="ch08--206">
      In point of fact, Marx and Engels “joined” the Democratic party not merely as a “means of gaining the ear of the
      working class,” but also because they had a theoretical concept of the Democracy as the leader of the coming
      radical revolution.
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="ch08--207">
      In line with this political outlook, the group of Communist coworkers around Marx in Cologne adopted a simple
      division of labor, to begin with. On the basis of the same political position, some (especially Schapper and
      Moll) concentrated their activity in the Cologne Workers Association, which had been founded only in April.
      Others, headed by Marx, initially concentrated on making the <em id="ch08--208" class="calibre8">N.R.Z.</em> a political force
      inside the movement of the Democracy, becoming active members of the city Democratic Association, as well as of
      the Workers Association. (The two associations, moreover, usually worked together—when Gottschalk’s intrigues
      were not setting them at loggerheads.) When the American journalist Albert Brisbane visited Cologne on his
      journey <a id="page_214" class="calibre6"></a>through the revolution, he found that Marx was “the leader of the popular
      movement.”<sup id="ch08--210" class="calibre13"><a id="ch08fn29" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch08--212" href="39_split_000.html#ch08fn29-r">29</a></sup>
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="ch08--213">

      Workers Association—not only in the Democratic Association—grew steadily despite his arduous work in putting out
      a daily, and despite the bitter opposition of the Gottschalk clique; later in the year, Marx was even elected
      president of the Workers Association.<sup id="ch08--216" class="calibre13"><a id="ch08fn30" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch08--218" href="39_split_000.html#ch08fn30-r">30</a></sup> This association had its own organ, which carried its news and reports,
      whereas the <em id="ch08--219" class="calibre8">N.R.Z.</em> was oriented toward the Democratic movement nationally. Although
      published in Cologne, its impact was directed outward; more radical papers elsewhere reprinted from its columns.

    <div class="indent" id="ch08--222">

      subtitle of the <em id="ch08--223" class="calibre8">N.R.Z.</em>, translated as “Organ of Democracy,” is understood to mean “organ
      of bourgeois democracy,” and, on top of this, the claim is made that the columns of the paper ignored the working
      class and its issues, at least for months. We have seen that the first part of this picture is a mistake; the
      second part is false.<a id="ch08en7-r" class="calibre6"></a><a class="nounder1" id="ch08--225" href="43.html#ch08en7">**</a>

    <div class="indent" id="ch08--226">
      <a id="page_215" class="calibre6"></a>One need only read Marx’s and Engels’ articles during the first month, June, to confirm
      Engels’ later statement that the <em id="ch08--228" class="calibre8">N.R.Z.</em> “represented the standpoint of the proletariat
      within the Democratic movement of the time,”<sup id="ch08--229" class="calibre13"><a id="ch08fn32" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch08--231" href="39_split_000.html#ch08fn32-r">32</a></sup> or his description of the <em id="ch08--232" class="calibre8">N.R.Z.</em> line
      as “our proletarian Democracy.”<sup id="ch08--233" class="calibre13"><a id="ch08fn33" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch08--235" href="39_split_000.html#ch08fn33-r">33</a></sup> To be sure, these later summary statements were worded on the basis of a memory
      conditioned by later developments, but they are essentially accurate, as when he writes that the “banner” of the
      <em id="ch08--236" class="calibre8">N.R.Z.</em> “could only be that of the Democracy, but of a Democracy that everywhere
      emphasized in detail the specific proletarian character which it could not yet inscribe once for all on its
      banner.”<sup id="ch08--237" class="calibre13"><a id="ch08fn34" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch08--239" href="39_split_000.html#ch08fn34-r">34</a></sup> What this means is that the paper presented a proletarian (communist) version
      of the Democratic program but not a full proletarian program.
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="ch08--240">
      To begin with, the <em id="ch08--241" class="calibre8">N.R.Z.</em> clearly analyzed current events in terms of class struggles,
      counterposing the interests of the bourgeoisie to those of the “people” and the workers. Here is one brief
      example, among many, of how this was done: in a June 7 article on the clash of economic interests in the Berlin
      assembly in connection with the foreign trade in wool, Engels explained that the wool producers were almost all
      big landowners of the aristocracy whereas “the wool manufacturers are mostly big capitalists, gentlemen of the
      big bourgeoisie.” Hence the issue, he explained to the new readers, had to do with “class interests, whether the
      big landed aristocracy would fleece the big bourgeoisie, or vice versa.” He adds, “For us Democrats” the only
      interest of this case is to reveal the relation between the “merely conservative class” (the bourgeoisie) and the
      “reactionary class” (the aristocracy).<sup id="ch08--242" class="calibre13"><a id="ch08fn35" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch08--244" href="39_split_000.html#ch08fn35-r">35</a></sup> Another typical article, on June 14, directed against the bourgeois
      liberals in the government, counterposed the “big bourgeoisie” to “the people, that is, the workers and the
      democratic citizenry [<em id="ch08--245" class="calibre8">Bürgerschaft</em>].”<sup id="ch08--246" class="calibre13"><a id="ch08fn36" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch08--248" href="39_split_000.html#ch08fn36-r">36</a></sup>

    <div class="indent" id="ch08--249">
      Such articles appeared in the first few days of the paper’s existence. No doubt Marx would have preferred to take

      before the first month was up, there was the June uprising of the Paris workers— “the most colossal event in the

      revolution. It cannot be overemphasized that this was done, furthermore, in face of an almost unanimous
      journalistic hysteria over the specter of revolution <a id="page_216" class="calibre6"></a>in France. Not to speak of the
      bourgeois liberals, there was scarcely a single organ even of the “Democratic party” anywhere in Germany that

      In the teeth of this storm the <em id="ch08--259" class="calibre8">N.R.Z.,</em> less than a month old, not only gave total support
      to the Paris uprising, in numerous articles with detailed reportage, but highlighted the fact that it was the
      revolt of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie, not a Democratic party movement. Since this was done in
      massive detail, a few examples will suffice.

    <div class="indent" id="ch08--260">
      In the very first account of the Paris battle, Engels’ first sentence was: “The uprising is a purely

      Since the myth applies to the first months of the <em id="ch08--311" class="calibre8">N.R.Z.</em>, we need not go further; the

      The political function of the myth about the <em id="ch08--315" class="calibre8">N.R.Z.</em> will become clearer below, for its
      role is to lay the basis for another and coordinate myth, that of Marx’s fictional “Blanquist aberration” of
      1850; this will be considered in its place, in <a class="nounder1" id="ch08--316" href="18.html#ch10">Chapter
      10</a>. Now our main interest is in making clear the mutually reinforcing character of the two aspects of the
      <em id="ch08--317" class="calibre8">N.R.Z.’s</em> policy: to act as the left wing of the Democracy itself, pushing for expansion
      of the revolution, and (to use Engels’ word <a id="page_218" class="calibre6"></a>again) to represent the standpoint of the
      proletariat within the Democratic movement. The real problem was: how long could the <em id="ch08--319" class="calibre8">N.R.Z.</em> try to ride these two horses, and under what conditions?
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="ch08--320">
      Before turning to this fateful issue of the revolution, let us summarize the policy with which Marx <em id="ch08--321" class="calibre8">began</em> operations in Cologne. First of all, there was the two-platoon division of labor already
      mentioned. As a matter of policy the Marx political center aimed to build two cooperating movements, the
      Democratic club movement and the Cologne Workers Association. The role of the paper was to deal with the overall
      politics of the revolution, as a guide to both movements. In this context:
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="ch08--322">
      1. The <em id="ch08--323" class="calibre8">N.R.Z.</em> was the organ of the extreme left (proletarian) wing of a Democratic
      movement which was itself envisaged as a bloc of lower classes (proletariat, small peasantry, petty-bourgeoisie)
      arrayed against the “big bourgeoisie” represented politically by bourgeois liberalism.<a id="ch08en9-r" class="calibre6"></a><a class="nounder1" id="ch08--325" href="43.html#ch08en9">*</a>
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="ch08--326">
      2. This is not to say that it presented itself as the organ of a workers’ movement, let alone a workers’
      organization; it did not. As mentioned, the Cologne workers’ organization had its own organ, which Marx and his
      friends supported; there was no competition between this paper and the <em id="ch08--327" class="calibre8">N.R.Z.</em> From the
      standpoint of the <em id="ch08--328" class="calibre8">N.R.Z.</em>, the workers’ associations of the various cities, like their
      Democratic Associations, were <em id="ch08--329" class="calibre8">parts</em> of the general Democratic movement or “Democratic
      party.”
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="ch08--330">
      3. The <em id="ch08--331" class="calibre8">N.R.Z.</em> was an agitational newspaper, not a theoretical magazine, though it often
      stopped to explain political ideas, especially in <a id="page_219" class="calibre6"></a>major articles by Marx. It agitated for
      the revolution of the Democracy. It did not agitate for communism (or socialism) in Germany but explained, as in
      connection with the June uprising, that it did not believe that communism was as yet on the order of the day for
      Germany.<sup id="ch08--333" class="calibre13"><a id="ch08fn48" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch08--335" href="39_split_000.html#ch08fn48-r">48</a></sup> As a political center the Marx group did carry on educational work for
      communism to train a vanguard, but this educational work was carried on particularly in and through the Workers
      Association.

    <div class="indent" id="ch08--336">
      Marx was quite aware that widespread public propaganda for communism at this stage might scare the pith out of
      the already quite pithless bourgeoisie. This brings us back to the central dilemma that became increasingly clear
      as the revolution stumbled on. If the bourgeoisie was so easily panicked, could it really be depended on to do
      its duty and make its <em id="ch08--337" class="calibre8">own</em> revolution, as Marx and Engels had so confidently expected?

    <div class="indent" id="ch08--339">
      We have seen with what assurance Marx and Engels had predicted that the bourgeoisie had no alternative to
      carrying through a political revolution that would put it in power and introduce a constitutional-liberal regime.
      We have seen that they were quite aware of how fainthearted this bourgeoisie was and how much it feared the
      threat of the proletariat behind it; but this did not yet lead them to conclude that the bourgeoisie might refuse
      to carry out its historical task. It did suggest to them that the initial task of the proletariat (or “the
      people”) might be to push the bourgeoisie from behind. But one way or the other, the outcome was going to be “not
      what the bourgeoisie merely <em id="ch08--340" class="calibre8">want</em> but rather what they <em id="ch08--341" class="calibre8">must</em>

      It was only in the course of the revolution itself that they found out that the bourgeoisie did not recognize the
      “must.” Some decades later, Engels wrote as if that was to have been expected. Reviewing the 1848-1849 period, he
      first stated the historic issue:
    </div>

    <div class="bq" id="ch08--346">
      The question is, who is to rule: the forces of society and state grouped around the absolute monarchy—big feudal
      landowners, army, bureaucracy, clerical crew—or, rather, the bourgeoisie. The <a id="page_220" class="calibre6"></a>still nascent
      proletariat has an interest in the struggle only insofar as through the bourgeoisie’s victory it gets air and
      light to nourish its own development, elbow-room to carry on the struggle in which it will one day gain the
      victory over all other classes.

      damned duty. As against the old feudal society, both of them— bourgeoisie as well as proletariat—constitute the

      At the time in 1848, Engels confessed surprise at the refusal of the bourgeoisie even to defend its specific
      bourgeois interests against the old ruling class. The context is the clash between the bourgeois manufacturers
      and the aristocratic landowners over the wool trade which we have already mentioned:
    </div>

    <div class="bqi" id="ch08--355">
      For us Democrats, the matter is of interest only because Herr Hansemann [bourgeois-liberal minister] takes the

    <div class="indentb" id="ch08--361">
      What had happened? Engels wrote, a week later, that the bourgeoisie had concluded a general social alliance with
      the “defeated” party of absolutism instead of doing its duty of overthrowing the latter’s power completely. The
      bourgeoisie, through the Hansemann ministry, might be running the government but “the revolution was not
      completed.”

      All this in the first two weeks of the <em id="ch08--371" class="calibre8">N.R.Z.</em> As early as June 4 Marx had raised a

      such talk about a “second revolution” pointed to the need for a revised perspective.

    <h3 class="h2" id="ch08lev7">7. WHY THE BOURGEOISIE PREFERRED REACTION</h3>

    <div class="indent" id="ch08--385">
      Why had it turned out that there was no historic compulsion on the bourgeoisie to “do its damned duty” and carry
      through the ousting of the old ruling classes from the seats of state power? There are three points to be made.
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="ch08--386">
      1. The most basic consideration is that Marx and Engels found they were wrong in their original belief that the
      direct capture of state power was the only road for the bourgeoisie to the modernization and industrialization of
      the economy, to its bourgeoisification. The alternative <a id="page_222" class="calibre6"></a>was what Marx later analyzed as
      Bonapartism. This is also why Bismarckian Bonapartism was the “revolution from above,” as against the revolution
      from below by the Democracy which he advocated. It was the substitute revolution.
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="ch08--388">
      The bourgeois liberal leaders did not think it out that way in 1848-1849. What consciously pushed them along this
      line was a negative: fear of the revolution itself. It is true that Marx and Engels had been aware of this factor
      long in advance—after all, even in his very first article of 1842 Marx had already taken a slap at “the natural
      impotence of a half-liberalism,” referring to the bourgeois-liberal representation in the Rhenish Diet.<sup id="ch08--389" class="calibre13"><a id="ch08fn56" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch08--391" href="39_split_000.html#ch08fn56-r">56</a></sup> But
      they had not believed that this fear could or would outweigh everything else for the bourgeoisie.
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="ch08--392">
      2. In general, the bourgeoisie’s fear included a mortal dread of anything that created upsets, disturbance,
      agitation, turbulence, and instability—all bad for business.<a id="ch08en11-r" class="calibre6"></a><a class="nounder1" id="ch08--394" href="43.html#ch08en11">*</a>
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="ch08--395">
      To the outbreak of the revolution the bourgeoisie reacted with “that eternal outcry for order and tranquillity,
      which has everywhere seized this class after violent commotions and consequent derangement of trade.”<sup id="ch08--396" class="calibre13"><a id="ch08fn59" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch08--398" href="39_split_000.html#ch08fn59-r">59</a></sup> In the
      <em id="ch08--399" class="calibre8">N.R.Z.</em> Engels wrote contemptuously:
    </div>

    <div class="bqi" id="ch08--400">
      But we [Germans] were philistines and we remain philistines. We have made a couple of dozen revolutions, little
      and big, of which we ourselves got scared before they were ever brought to completion. After talking real big, we
      carried out nothing at all. … All questions were handled with the most timorous, obtuse and narrowminded
      philistinism …<sup id="ch08--401" class="calibre13"><a id="ch08fn60" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch08--403" href="39_split_000.html#ch08fn60-r">60</a></sup>
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="ch08--404">
      Toward the end of 1848 Marx wrote scathingly of the bourgeoisie’s “wretched, jittery, narrowminded egoism,” which
      filled it with fear as soon as a finger was laid on property anywhere. Its main slogan was restoration of
      confidence and the credit system; that is why every <a id="page_223" class="calibre6"></a>stirring had to be suppressed, not only
      among the proletariat but in every social stratum that had interests different from the bourgeoisie. The
      Hansemann ministry set out to strengthen the state power in order to restore confidence and credit, but it only
      strengthened a state power that restored confidence in itself through bullets, since it lacked all credit.
      Therefore its activity boiled down to police work, and it “represented nothing but the <em id="ch08--406" class="calibre8">old</em>, refurbished <em id="ch08--407" class="calibre8">police- and bureaucratic state.</em>”<sup id="ch08--408" class="calibre13"><a id="ch08fn61" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch08--410" href="39_split_000.html#ch08fn61-r">61</a></sup>
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="ch08--411">
      This remained a frequent theme in Marx’s writings, as he kept on emphasizing that the revolution of 1848 failed
      because “at that time the bourgeois preferred peace-and-quiet accompanied by servitude rather than the mere
      <em id="ch08--412" class="calibre8">prospect</em> of struggle [even if] accompanied by freedom …”<sup id="ch08--413" class="calibre13"><a id="ch08fn62" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch08--415" href="39_split_000.html#ch08fn62-r">62</a></sup> In 1850 Engels summed up
      the character of the German bourgeoisie: it
    </div>

    <div class="bq" id="ch08--416">
      is infinitely more fainthearted than the English or French, and insofar as even the slightest chance of returning

    <div class="noindent" id="ch08--420">
      A decade after the revolution Marx explained to his <em id="ch08--421" class="calibre8">New York Tribune</em> readers that
      politics in Prussia must be understood in terms of the pusillanimity of the bourgeoisie. While they do not like
      “moderate solvency” on the part of debtors, their watchword is “moderate liberty.” This sector, “whose political
      creed may be characterized as <em id="ch08--422" class="calibre8">liberalismus vulgaris</em>, is anything but heroical.”
    </div>

    <div class="bq" id="ch08--423">
      Then there is before their eyes and in their hearts the still fresh remembrance of the revolution; and, lastly,
      the Prince Regent must not be frightened out of his new constitutionalism. So one liberal hero admonishes the
      other, to do him the good service which the husband asked from his wife on her being insulted in the open street
      by a military officer. “Keep me back,” cried the gallant fellow, “or I shall take revenge, and there will be
      bloodshed.”

    <div class="noindent" id="ch08--424">
      This bourgeoisie knows, Marx continued, that if its local liberalism goes beyond very narrow limits, “it must
      roll back or resolve itself into a general continental movement. The fear of the latter is shared alike by the
      higher middle class and by the Prince Regent.”<sup id="ch08--425" class="calibre13"><a id="ch08fn64" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch08--427" href="39_split_000.html#ch08fn64-r">64</a></sup> The “Constitution-mongers” of the bourgeoisie, he wrote in

      3. Of course, this cowardice and congenital dread of disorder had very material roots, which we have already seen
      indicated: fear of the proletariat pressing in the rear. In 1848 this fear took on flesh and blood. The <em id="ch08--433" class="calibre8">Communist Manifesto</em> had ended: “Let the ruling classes tremble at a Communistic revolution.”
      They did. Not because of the Manifesto or of literary productions from any quarter; they began trembling even

      June uprising in Paris sent the German bourgeoisie stampeding in terror into the arms of the Crown and the
      aristocracy, even though nothing of the sort was happening in Germany. Marx wrote in the <em id="ch08--446" class="calibre8">N.R.Z.</em> on June 29 that the French bourgeoisie had had to put an end to the threat from below:

      The example held for the Germans; they too had to end the threat from below before it grew too menacing. The
      French government’s bloody suppression of the June uprising was inspiring. The pattern was next brought home to
      Marx by the debacle in Austria as the bourgeoisie “betrayed” Vienna:

    <div class="indent" id="ch08--466">
      The original scenario for permanent revolution had had the bourgeoisie making an alliance with the Democracy to
      overthrow the old ruling classes. What Marx saw in the course of 1848 was that the bourgeoisie had turned in the
      other direction, making an alliance with the trinity of Crown-aristocracy-bureaucracy on which the old state
      rested.
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="ch08--467">
      This was spelled out in a major four-part article by Marx in December, “The Bourgeoisie and the
      Counterrevolution.” The two camps, rivals for state power, had made a deal:
    </div>

    <div class="bqi" id="ch08--468">
      The Crown would sacrifice the nobility for the bourgeoisie; the bourgeoisie would sacrifice the people for the
      Crown. Under these conditions the monarchy becomes bourgeois and the bourgeoisie becomes monarchist.<sup id="ch08--469" class="calibre13"><a id="ch08fn72" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch08--471" href="39_split_000.html#ch08fn72-r">72</a></sup>

    <div class="noindentb" id="ch08--472">
      The bourgeoisie was intoxicated by the delusion that “the ruling powers of the old state” would really
      subordinate themselves to bourgeois political domination. Thus—
    </div>

    <div class="bqi2" id="ch08--473">
      It was clear. The Prussian bourgeoisie had only one task, the task of establishing itself snugly in its rule, of
      getting rid of the troublesome anarchists [revolutionary people], of restoring “calm and order” and bringing back
      the revenues that had gone lost during the March upheaval. … The weapons that the Prussian bourgeoisie had been
      forced to avail itself of, in its struggle against the feudal society and its monarchy—right of association,
      freedom of the press, etc.: must they not be shattered in the <a id="page_226" class="calibre6"></a>hands of a people carried away
      by folly, which no longer needed to wield them <em id="ch08--475" class="calibre8">for</em> the bourgeoisie and showed signs of a

    <div class="indent" id="ch08--493">
      Soon after the end of the revolutionary period, Engels produced his historical study on <em id="ch08--494" class="calibre8">The
      Peasant War in Germany</em>, which was explicitly presented as a parable for 1848: “The classes and fractions of
      classes which everywhere betrayed 1848 and 1849 are to be found in the role of traitors as early as 1525, though
      on a lower level of development.”<sup id="ch08--495" class="calibre13"><a id="ch08fn76" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch08--497" href="39_split_000.html#ch08fn76-r">76</a></sup> In a later preface to this work, Engels summarized the question we are now
      discussing. He noted that he had been wrong in writing in 1850 that “the modern big bourgeois” were “rapidly
      getting [the Austrian and Prussian monarchies] under their yoke by means of the national debt. And behind the big
      bourgeois stand the proletarians.”<sup id="ch08--498" class="calibre13"><a id="ch08fn77" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch08--500" href="39_split_000.html#ch08fn77-r">77</a></sup> (Even in 1850 he still had illusions that the bourgeoisie was going to “do
      its damned duty,” if only in another form.) Writing two decades later, he <a id="page_227" class="calibre6"></a>recognized that
      “the mass of the bourgeoisie … does not <em id="ch08--502" class="calibre8">want</em> to rule. It still has 1848 in its
      bones.”<sup id="ch08--503" class="calibre13"><a id="ch08fn78" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch08--505" href="39_split_000.html#ch08fn78-r">78</a></sup> That is, its decisive motivation is still fear of the proletariat.
    </div>

    <div class="indent" id="ch08--506">
      This was the link between the bourgeoisie’s dread of the permanent revolution and the phenomenon of Bonapartism.
      Engels sets it forth in an important passage. In two decades the German bourgeoisie has developed economically,
      but “How, then, is it possible that the bourgeoisie has not conquered political power as well, that it behaves in
      so cowardly a manner towards the government?”
    </div>

    <div class="bqi" id="ch08--507">
      It is the misfortune of the German bourgeoisie to have arrived too late, as is the favorite German manner. The
      period of its florescence is occurring at a time when the bourgeoisie of the other West European countries is
      already politically in decline. In England, the bourgeoisie could get its real representative, Bright, into the
      government only by an extension of the franchise, whose consequences are bound to put an end to all bourgeois
      rule. In France, where the bourgeoisie as such, as a class in its entirety, held power for only two years, 1849
      and 1850, under the republic, it was able to continue its social existence only by abdicating its political power
      to Louis Bonaparte and the army. And on account of the enormously increased interaction of the three most
      advanced European countries, it is today no longer possible for the bourgeoisie to settle down to comfortable
      political rule in Germany after this rule has outlived its usefulness in England and France.<sup id="ch08--508" class="calibre13"><a id="ch08fn79" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch08--510" href="39_split_000.html#ch08fn79-r">79</a></sup>
    </div>

    <div class="noindent" id="ch08--511">
      This is the pattern of uneven and combined development at work.
    </div>

    <div class="bqi" id="ch08--512">
      It is a peculiarity of the bourgeoisie, in contrast to all former ruling classes, that there is a turning point
      in its development after which every further expansion of its agencies of power, hence primarily of its capital,
      only tends to make it more and more unfit for political rule.<a id="ch08en14-r" class="calibre6"></a><a class="nounder1" id="ch08--514" href="43.html#ch08en14">*</a> “<em id="ch08--515" class="calibre8">Behind the big bourgeois stand the
      proletarians.</em>” As the bourgeoisie develops its industry, commerce and means of communications, it produces
      the proletariat. At a certain point—which need not be reached everywhere at the same time or at the same stage of
      development—it begins to <a id="page_228" class="calibre6"></a>notice that its proletarian double is outgrowing it. From that
      moment on, it loses the strength required for exclusive political rule; it looks around for allies with whom to
      share its rule, or to whom to cede the whole of its rule, as circumstances may require.

    <div class="noindentb" id="ch08--517">
      This is all a generalization from the experience of the revolution of 1848-1849. He applies it specifically to
      Germany:
    </div>

    <div class="bqi2" id="ch08--518">
      In Germany this turning point came as early as 1848. To be sure, the German bourgeoisie was less frightened by
      the German proletariat than by the French. The June 1848 battle in Paris showed the bourgeoisie what it ought to
      expect; the German proletariat was restless enough to prove to it that the seed that would yield the same crop
      had already been sown to German soil, too; from that day on the edge was taken off all bourgeois political
      action. The bourgeoisie looked round for allies, sold itself to them regardless of the price—and even today
      [1870] it has not advanced one step.

    <div class="bqi2" id="ch08--519">
      These allies are all reactionary by nature. There is the monarchy with its army and its bureaucracy; there is the
      big feudal nobility; there are the little cabbage-Junkers and there are even the priests. With all of these the
      bourgeoisie made pacts and bargains, if only to save its dear skin, until at last it had nothing left to barter.
      And the more the proletariat developed, the more it felt as a class and acted as a class, the more fainthearted
      did the bourgeois become.<sup id="ch08--520" class="calibre13"><a id="ch08fn82" class="calibre14"></a><a class="nounder2" id="ch08--522" href="39_split_000.html#ch08fn82-r">82</a></sup>

      If the [defeat of the] June insurrection raised the self-assurance of the bourgeoisie all over the Continent and

    <div class="noindent" id="ch08--528">
      The bourgeoisie was indeed prevented from consolidating its political rule, but, in the sequel under Bismarckian
      Bonapartism, it went ahead to consolidate its economic rule nevertheless. The same factors that negated the path
      of permanent revolution <em id="ch08--529" class="calibre8">in the form envisioned by Marx and Engels in 1848</em> also pushed the
      bourgeoisie along the path of Bonapartism.
