## Abstract {property="name"}

::: {role="paragraph"}
Fifty years after the Sixth Special Session, the Progressive
International (PI) has declared a strategy of \"renovating the NIEO\".
However, key questions remain about the decisions that created and led
the original campaign. The NIEO\'s draft declarations were brought to
the UN General Assembly by the leaders of 95 states, caucused as the
G77. Their solidarity was necessarily pluralistic, drawing on Marxist
and Liberal visions of what Adom Getachew called "post-imperial
worldmaking". This raises the question of how this global \"common
front\" was possible, and what the PI might do differently this time. As
a partial explanation, I compare two of the project\'s strategic
imaginaries, showing that they were successfully synthesised in
practice. As this legacy inspires the PI\'s focus on the possibilities
of sovereign debt crises, the NIEO continues to play an important
historical role. It alludes to possible options, or alternative futures,
of world order and global development.

This article is part of a Special Issue commemorating the fiftieth
anniversary of the campaign for a NIEO (UN
[1974a](#index.xhtml_CIT0061){.biblioref role="doc-biblioref"
xml-rid="CIT0061"}, [1974b](#index.xhtml_CIT0060){.biblioref
role="doc-biblioref" xml-rid="CIT0060"}), but the project's significance
transcends the past. Right now, the Progressive International (PI) is
seeking to "Renew the Non-Aligned Movement" and "Renovate the NIEO"
(Havana Congress [2023](#index.xhtml_CIT0011){.biblioref
role="doc-biblioref" xml-rid="CIT0011"}). The original project attempted
to resolve an uncertain world economic crisis through a global consensus
on the reformation of global trade, finance, and debt (Murphy
[1984](#index.xhtml_CIT0038){.biblioref role="doc-biblioref"
xml-rid="CIT0038"}; UN [1974a](#index.xhtml_CIT0061){.biblioref
role="doc-biblioref" xml-rid="CIT0061"}). Its vision drew on longer,
global struggles against neo-colonialism and the declining terms of
trade (UNGAa, 4(j); UNGA [1974b](#index.xhtml_CIT0061){.biblioref
role="doc-biblioref" xml-rid="CIT0061"}, Chapter II, Section 1(a):
i--xii;), problems most famously articulated by Kwame Nkrumah and Raúl
Prebisch. The passing of the NIEO's founding declarations led to a
wholesale reconsideration, across the entire United Nations system, of
the global architecture of development. However, after the
"assassination" of the NIEO during the so-called Third World Debt Crisis
(Prashad [2007](#index.xhtml_CIT0046){.biblioref role="doc-biblioref"
xml-rid="CIT0046"}), these structural debates were silenced by a
neo-colonial "common sense". For decades, development studies and the
development industry have largely assumed that "there is no alternative"
to neo-liberal globalisation (Berger and Weber
[2014](#index.xhtml_CIT0004){.biblioref role="doc-biblioref"
xml-rid="CIT0004"}, 24--25, 81; Fisher
[1999](#index.xhtml_CIT0019){.biblioref role="doc-biblioref"
xml-rid="CIT0019"}; Prashad [2007](#index.xhtml_CIT0046){.biblioref
role="doc-biblioref" xml-rid="CIT0046"}, 214--219). The PI's goal of
renovating the NIEO is a renewed attempt at creating precisely such
alternatives.
:::

::: {role="paragraph"}
Launched in May 2020, the PI is a movement of movements aiming to unite
progressive forces globally, and its NIEO campaign is based on a sober
assessment of the original. In calling to seize "the opportunity of the
present historical juncture", its *Havana Declaration on the NIEO* notes
that "the crisis of the existing world system can either entrench
inequalities or embolden the call to reclaim Southern protagonism"
(Havana Congress [2023](#index.xhtml_CIT0011){.biblioref
role="doc-biblioref" xml-rid="CIT0011"}). This is a lesson from the rise
and decline of the solidarity of the original NIEO campaign. Initially,
when the Non-Aligned Movement leveraged the new power of the
Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), "Southern
protagonism" was emboldened. However, it was eventually crushed during
the so-called Third World Debt Crisis. This presents the Progressive
International with the problem of understanding, as Yanis Varoufakis
([2023](#index.xhtml_CIT0062){.biblioref role="doc-biblioref"
xml-rid="CIT0062"}) has asked: "Why did we lose last time round?"
Unfortunately, the academic literature is still struggling to answer
this question. Despite the historical reconsideration of the NIEO that
followed Vijay Prashad's pioneering histories of "the Third World
Project" (Gilman [2015](#index.xhtml_CIT0022){.biblioref
role="doc-biblioref" xml-rid="CIT0022"},
[2023](#index.xhtml_CIT0023){.biblioref role="doc-biblioref"
xml-rid="CIT0023"}; Prashad [2007](#index.xhtml_CIT0046){.biblioref
role="doc-biblioref" xml-rid="CIT0046"},
[2014](#index.xhtml_CIT0047){.biblioref role="doc-biblioref"
xml-rid="CIT0047"}; Schwartz [2023](#index.xhtml_CIT0053){.biblioref
role="doc-biblioref" xml-rid="CIT0053"}), fundamental questions remain
about the decision-making which created and led the campaign (Thornton
[2022](#index.xhtml_CIT0057){.biblioref role="doc-biblioref"
xml-rid="CIT0057"}; Venzke [2018](#index.xhtml_CIT0063){.biblioref
role="doc-biblioref" xml-rid="CIT0063"}). This article provides a
partial and broad-brush answer. By relying on the method of C.L.R.
James, I trace the counterfactuals -- or imagined "what if?" scenarios
-- that animated two of the NIEO's dominant strategies. That is, the
imagined futures which were used to devise and decide between the
available options. I then show how these strategic imaginaries were
synthesised, first theoretically and then in practice. Right now, the
same strategic imaginaries are inspiring the Progressive International's
attempt at reviving the project. This proves, as Nils Gilman
([2023](#index.xhtml_CIT0023){.biblioref role="doc-biblioref"
xml-rid="CIT0023"}, [1976](#index.xhtml_CIT0024){.biblioref
role="doc-biblioref" xml-rid="CIT0024"}) has argued, that the NIEO is a
"usable past". It offers badly needed alternatives to world order and
global development.

## Question of strategic decision-making

::: {role="paragraph"}
By the early 1980s, scholars began to realise that the core proposals of
the NIEO would not be implemented. Instead, G77 solidarity crumbled
amidst the so-called Third World Debt Crisis (Prashad
[2007](#index.xhtml_CIT0046){.biblioref role="doc-biblioref"
xml-rid="CIT0046"}, 210). In this climate, a near consensus emerged
among those who had once viewed it as either a serious threat or
opportunity (Cox [1978](#index.xhtml_CIT0013){.biblioref
role="doc-biblioref" xml-rid="CIT0013"}; Gosovic and Ruggie
[1976](#index.xhtml_CIT0024){.biblioref role="doc-biblioref"
xml-rid="CIT0024"}). From the imperialist Henry Kissinger
([1982](#index.xhtml_CIT0032){.biblioref role="doc-biblioref"
xml-rid="CIT0032"}), to the theorist of embedded liberalism, John Ruggie
(Bhagwati and Ruggie [1984](#index.xhtml_CIT0005){.biblioref
role="doc-biblioref" xml-rid="CIT0005"}), and the historical materialist
Robert W. Cox ([1981](#index.xhtml_CIT0014){.biblioref
role="doc-biblioref" xml-rid="CIT0014"}), all agreed. For them, the
demise of the NIEO proved that it had never stood a chance. This
dismissive consensus became the baseline assumption across the social
sciences, including in development studies.[^1] The pioneering global
political economist, Susan Strange, went so far as to describe the
NIEO's hopes as "an illusion" (Strange
\[[1988](#index.xhtml_CIT0055){.biblioref role="doc-biblioref"
xml-rid="CIT0055"}\] [2015](#index.xhtml_CIT0055){.biblioref
role="doc-biblioref" xml-rid="CIT0055"}, 263). In Gilbert Rist's
critique of development, he argued that the NIEO's ambivalent proposals
do "no more than reinforce the existing order of things"
([2009](#index.xhtml_CIT0049){.biblioref role="doc-biblioref"
xml-rid="CIT0049"}, 49--150). In other words, it had no capacity for
change. There is nothing wrong with these conclusions, per se. The
problem is that they were made without historical research into the
decision-making which had created and led the project. To prove that the
NIEO could never have succeeded, one must understand the available
options. Had G77 elites considered choices which, if taken, might have
led to more success? In short, no one knew, and until Vijay Prashad's
pioneering histories of the "Third World Project"
([2007](#index.xhtml_CIT0046){.biblioref role="doc-biblioref"
xml-rid="CIT0046"}, [2014](#index.xhtml_CIT0047){.biblioref
role="doc-biblioref" xml-rid="CIT0047"}), no one bothered to find out.
Instead, the NIEO's failure was assumed to be inevitable. As a result,
scholars and practitioners of development have largely ignored this most
pivotal moment, and the political strategies that made it possible. For
a key exception, see Berger and Weber
([2014](#index.xhtml_CIT0004){.biblioref role="doc-biblioref"
xml-rid="CIT0004"}, 14).
:::

::: {role="paragraph"}
This dismissive consensus rested on a rejection of the counterfactual
analysis that is essential for making and understanding decisions.
Counterfactuals are imagined, "what if?" scenarios. For Robert W. Cox,
the rejection of counterfactuals was explicit. He viewed them as "the
stuff of idealism rather than of historical materialism" (Cox
[1991](#index.xhtml_CIT0015){.biblioref role="doc-biblioref"
xml-rid="CIT0015"}, 175). Without counterfactual analysis, however, Cox
was unable to properly consider the decision-making, and therefore
power, of the NIEO project. This can be appreciated by considering the
method of C.L.R. James, whose groundbreaking research uncovered the
previously neglected power that had created and led the Haitian
Revolution. In *The Black Jacobins* ( [\[1938\]
1989](#index.xhtml_CIT0031){.biblioref role="doc-biblioref"
xml-rid="CIT0031"}), James explored the key decisions made by the
leaders of global social forces. To do so, he relied extensively on
counterfactuals. For example, he analysed not just Napoleon's decision
to invade Haiti, but his deeply considered option not to (James
\[[1938\] 1989](#index.xhtml_CIT0031){.biblioref role="doc-biblioref"
xml-rid="CIT0031"}, 270--271, 373). This rested on a
historical--empirical assessment of how Napoleon's advisors had imagined
what would happen if each option were taken. This allowed James to
consider not just what happened, but what *might have been if* things
had been decided differently. For example, James reasoned that with
better leadership by Toussaint, the former slave and revolutionary
leader, Napoleon's attack "would have been crippled at the start"
(299--300). From this position of strength, Toussaint's forces might
have succeeded in forming an alliance with the French republic (285). In
doing so, James showed how imaginary "what if?" scenarios are
foundational to understanding decision-making and power. To choose
between option a, b, or c, a person imagines *what would happen if* each
option were taken. To understand the agency that created and led the
original NIEO, therefore, it is necessary to search for the
counterfactual logics that the project relied on, even if implicitly.
That means considering how the NIEO's leaders answered a key question:
what would happen if NIEO-style reforms were implemented?
:::

::: {role="paragraph"}
Of course, understanding the decision-making that created and led the
NIEO is difficult (Venzke [2018](#index.xhtml_CIT0063){.biblioref
role="doc-biblioref" xml-rid="CIT0063"}). As C.L.R. James
(\[[1938](#index.xhtml_CIT0031){.biblioref role="doc-biblioref"
xml-rid="CIT0031"}\] [1989](#index.xhtml_CIT0031){.biblioref
role="doc-biblioref" xml-rid="CIT0031"}, x) was well aware, strategic
options are not imagined in a vacuum. Consciousness is embedded within
historical forces which it does not choose. The NIEO presents additional
difficulties, for it was created by political leaders and diplomats from
95 diverse states, who held contradictory beliefs about the
possibilities of changing the post-WWII world order (Byrne
[2016](#index.xhtml_CIT0009){.biblioref role="doc-biblioref"
xml-rid="CIT0009"}; Lal [2015](#index.xhtml_CIT0033){.biblioref
role="doc-biblioref" xml-rid="CIT0033"}; Thornton
[2022](#index.xhtml_CIT0057){.biblioref role="doc-biblioref"
xml-rid="CIT0057"}). This was shown brilliantly in Adom Getachew's
([2019](#index.xhtml_CIT0021){.biblioref role="doc-biblioref"
xml-rid="CIT0021"}) *Worldmaking After Empire*, which offers a deep
exploration of the NIEO's intellectual foundations. Getachew traced the
project's ideological contradictions, including the fact that it had
been "Marxist in its diagnosis of economic dependence" but liberal in
terms of its prescriptions ([2019](#index.xhtml_CIT0021){.biblioref
role="doc-biblioref" xml-rid="CIT0021"}, 145). For Getachew, this was
only one of the project's many "internal limitations and
inconsistencies", which were only hidden because "external challenges
ensured that the project never had the opportunity for its internal
contradictions to unfold" (171). This argument is similar to Cox's
original claim that the NIEO lacked "a sufficiently clear view of an
alternative world political economy" (Cox
[1981](#index.xhtml_CIT0014){.biblioref role="doc-biblioref"
xml-rid="CIT0014"}, 150--151), and to Henry Kissinger's claim that the
NIEO's "philosophical framework seems to me to be extremely elusive"
([1982](#index.xhtml_CIT0032){.biblioref role="doc-biblioref"
xml-rid="CIT0032"}, 153). Others have gone further, arguing that the
group's internal contradictions rendered it incapable of negotiating its
core demands (Narlikar [2003](#index.xhtml_CIT0040){.biblioref
role="doc-biblioref" xml-rid="CIT0040"}, 58--69; Weiss
[1986](#index.xhtml_CIT0065){.biblioref role="doc-biblioref"
xml-rid="CIT0065"}, 6--7, 44--47). In other words, there never were
alternative options which G77 elites could have taken.
:::

::: {role="paragraph"}
This theory that the original NIEO had been so marred by internal
disagreements, and so lacking in a coherent vision of an alternative,
raises the question of how the project had been possible in the first
place. How could so many different state elites, with deep ideological
and material conflicts, create a global solidarity that forced
imperialists -- like Kissinger -- to negotiate? For the astonishing
thing about the NIEO is not that it had so many ideological and material
contradictions. That is a necessary part of any global solidarity. What
is remarkable is that these contradictions were synthesised in praxis.
To show this, I draw on C.L.R. James' counterfactual analysis to trace
the strategic imaginaries that inspired the decision-making of the
original NIEO. Of course, it is beyond the scope of this article to
consider the many decisions made by each individual G77 elite. Instead,
I trace the counterfactual logics used in two of the NIEO's foundational
theories of global development, Kwame Nkrumah's *Neocolonialism: The
Last Stage of Imperialism* ([1965](#index.xhtml_CIT0042){.biblioref
role="doc-biblioref" xml-rid="CIT0042"}), and Raúl Prebisch's *Towards a
New Trade Policy for Development*
([1964](#index.xhtml_CIT0048){.biblioref role="doc-biblioref"
xml-rid="CIT0048"}). Each text relied on distinct counterfactual claims
about what would happen if NIEO-style reforms were implemented. Nkrumah
devised several of the NIEO's core proposals as part of a wider strategy
that would help to create global socialism. Prebisch saw them as
temporary measures that would help create a properly functioning global
capitalist system. Nevertheless, at the level of world order, Nkrumah's
Leninism and Prebisch's liberalism overlapped (Nicholls
[2019](#index.xhtml_CIT0041){.biblioref role="doc-biblioref"
xml-rid="CIT0041"}, 59--61). Even if Nkrumah and Prebisch disagreed
about what NIEO-style reforms to world order would achieve, they both
supported the reforms (Bockman [2015](#index.xhtml_CIT0007){.biblioref
role="doc-biblioref" xml-rid="CIT0007"}). Here lies the theoretical
basis, I argue, for the non-aligned common front that created and led
the original NIEO campaign. This contradictory synthesis allowed the G77
to win support from Leninists to Liberals, and anyone in between.
Whether one sought global socialism, or properly functioning global free
trade, there was a historical, and therefore counterfactual, case to be
made for NIEO-style reforms.
:::

::: {role="paragraph"}
Of course, the common front's divergent goals reflected contradictory
social forces (Amin [1982](#index.xhtml_CIT0001){.biblioref
role="doc-biblioref" xml-rid="CIT0001"}, 445; Prashad
[2007](#index.xhtml_CIT0046){.biblioref role="doc-biblioref"
xml-rid="CIT0046"}, 52). By envisioning, and seeking, a properly
functioning global capitalism, Prebisch believed NIEO-style reforms
would be equally beneficial to the core and periphery. This implied a
strategy of seeking a consensus with capitalist elites in the core.
Nkrumah disagreed. He thought the idea that "the developed nations
should effectively assist the poorer parts of the world" had "little
prospect" of taking place (Nkrumah
[1965](#index.xhtml_CIT0042){.biblioref role="doc-biblioref"
xml-rid="CIT0042"}, xix). He imagined that NIEO-style reforms would be
damaging to the interests of imperialists. Thus, instead of seeking
global consensus, non-aligned elites should forge collective
independence. In practice, both strategies were synthesised. First, OPEC
elites acted in accordance with Nkrumah's strategic vision. Working
collectively, they seized control of the global oil market, which
heightened the global crisis. Then, this new power was used to call for
the Sixth Special Session of the UN General Assembly (Gwin
\[[1977](#index.xhtml_CIT0025){.biblioref role="doc-biblioref"
xml-rid="CIT0025"}\] [2019](#index.xhtml_CIT0025){.biblioref
role="doc-biblioref" xml-rid="CIT0025"}, 101; Murphy
\[[1984](#index.xhtml_CIT0038){.biblioref role="doc-biblioref"
xml-rid="CIT0038"}\] [2019](#index.xhtml_CIT0038){.biblioref
role="doc-biblioref" xml-rid="CIT0038"}; Sauvant
\[[1977](#index.xhtml_CIT0051){.biblioref role="doc-biblioref"
xml-rid="CIT0051"}\] [2019](#index.xhtml_CIT0051){.biblioref
role="doc-biblioref" xml-rid="CIT0051"}, 9--10). There, the G77 acted in
accordance with the Prebischian strategy of seeking global consensus
(Bedjaoui [1979](#index.xhtml_CIT0003){.biblioref role="doc-biblioref"
xml-rid="CIT0003"}, 196--197). Thus, collective independence that
deepened global crisis was used to power the possibility of a global
consensus that benefitted the North and South alike.
:::

::: {role="paragraph"}
For C.L.R. James, the point of counterfactual analysis was not simply to
understand the history of past decision-making. It was to use this
history to inform strategic decision-making in the present. This meant
asking not just what could have been decided, but what should have been
(James \[[1938](#index.xhtml_CIT0031){.biblioref role="doc-biblioref"
xml-rid="CIT0031"}\] [1989](#index.xhtml_CIT0031){.biblioref
role="doc-biblioref" xml-rid="CIT0031"}, 282). It is for this purpose
that Yanis Varoufakis ([2023](#index.xhtml_CIT0062){.biblioref
role="doc-biblioref" xml-rid="CIT0062"}) has called on the PI to ask
itself: "Why did we lose last time round?" Curiously, similar questions
were asked by Samir Amin ([1982](#index.xhtml_CIT0001){.biblioref
role="doc-biblioref" xml-rid="CIT0001"}) during the project's demise.
Despite agreeing with the emerging consensus that the NIEO had never
stood a chance, Amin embraced counterfactual analysis. This allowed him
to ask key questions of the project's praxis, including whether it had
failed because of "tactical errors", or unpredictable economic
contingencies (Amin [1982](#index.xhtml_CIT0001){.biblioref
role="doc-biblioref" xml-rid="CIT0001"}, 436). For Amin, there was
nothing that G77 elites could have done to avoid the destruction of the
NIEO project. In fact, he thought the G77's "common front" had been
dangerous. As such, this article starts with Amin.

## Samir Amin's Leninist rejection of the NIEO

::: {role="paragraph"}
Despite contributing to the scholarly consensus that the NIEO's failure
was inevitable, Samir Amin's historical materialism did not ignore
questions of the project's decision-making. He asked whether "the
factors behind the clearly visible failure" were "purely contingent"
aspects of the economic crisis, or "traceable to the 'tactical errors'
of the Third World" (Amin [1982](#index.xhtml_CIT0001){.biblioref
role="doc-biblioref" xml-rid="CIT0001"}, 436). Amin could consider
decision-making because he was open to counterfactual analysis (Patomäki
[2019](#index.xhtml_CIT0044){.biblioref role="doc-biblioref"
xml-rid="CIT0044"}). Indeed, his answer to these questions drew upon an
imaginary "what if?" scenario. He asked what it would mean if the G77
succeeded in "transforming this dependency relationship and compelling
the adjustment of the world system":

> ::: {role="paragraph"}
> If that should turn out to be the case one should be able to look back
> on imperialism as merely a stage -- an intermediate stage -- in the
> expansion of capitalism on a world scale and not as the highest stage
> of capitalism; it would have proved, that is, as the stage that
> ushered in the transition from a system characterised by the

> [1982](#index.xhtml_CIT0001){.biblioref role="doc-biblioref"
> xml-rid="CIT0001"}, 441--442).
> :::

In this sense, the NIEO project was an important experiment, which
tested the nature of imperialism itself. To explain why he thought the
project could never have succeeded, Amin constructed a theoretically
consistent account of imperialism, understood as a stage of capitalism
dominated by global monopoly capital. Within this Leninist imaginary,
the G77's "common front" was defined by its ruling classes (Amin
[1982](#index.xhtml_CIT0001){.biblioref role="doc-biblioref"
xml-rid="CIT0001"}, 445). Thus, whereas some advocates described the G77
as a group of "proletarian nations", or a "trade union of the poor"
(Getachew [2019](#index.xhtml_CIT0021){.biblioref role="doc-biblioref"
xml-rid="CIT0021"}, 168; Mazrui

[2014](#index.xhtml_CIT0052){.biblioref role="doc-biblioref"
xml-rid="CIT0052"}, 9), Amin defined them as a group of "peripheral
capitalist states and their bourgeoisies" (Amin
[1982](#index.xhtml_CIT0001){.biblioref role="doc-biblioref"
xml-rid="CIT0001"}, 432). In their struggle to industrialise, the
peripheral bourgeoisies were opposed by "the monopolies and the
imperialist states". Despite this resistance to the core, Amin noted
that the NIEO "permits an increase in the rate of profit on a world
scale and can only be read therefore, as a contribution to global
capitalist development". What's more, Amin pointed to the problem of
"sub-imperialism" within the G77, and argued that the NIEO had the
"effect of turning the Third World into a fair game for the rival
superpowers" ([1982](#index.xhtml_CIT0001){.biblioref
role="doc-biblioref" xml-rid="CIT0001"}, 447--448).
:::

::: {role="paragraph"}
Despite imagining the NIEO as both dangerous and ineffective, Amin did
not, like other historical materialists, ignore non-Western agency
(Hobson and Sajed [2017](#index.xhtml_CIT0029){.biblioref
role="doc-biblioref" xml-rid="CIT0029"}). To explain the "atmosphere"
which had made it "possible to contemplate" a NIEO, Amin pointed to a
global upsurge of popular forces across the Global South
([1982](#index.xhtml_CIT0001){.biblioref role="doc-biblioref"
xml-rid="CIT0001"}, 439; see also: Berger and Weber
[2014](#index.xhtml_CIT0004){.biblioref role="doc-biblioref"

[2007](#index.xhtml_CIT0046){.biblioref role="doc-biblioref"
xml-rid="CIT0046"}, [2014](#index.xhtml_CIT0046){.biblioref
role="doc-biblioref" xml-rid="CIT0046"}), and predicted a "new wave of
popular struggles" (447--448). Citing the anti-colonial revolutions that
had created the post-WWII world order, Amin looked towards the future.
"Not for the first time", he argued, "the peoples of the Third World may
well lead the process of world transformation" (447--448). This critique
has important implications for any project, like the Progressive
International (PI), which seeks to "renovate the NIEO". For if the NIEO
was a dangerous strategy, such projects should focus instead on the
development of domestic social forces. However, other counterfactuals
are possible.

## Strategic imaginary of Kwame Nkrumah

::: {role="paragraph"}
Nkrumah agreed with Amin that imperialism was the final stage of
capitalism. His classic work on neo-colonialism had not revised Lenin's
theory, but applied it to the post-WWII world order, a point which
Nkrumah made explicit:

> ::: {role="paragraph"}
> Colonialism has achieved a new guise. It has become neo-colonialism,
> the last stage of imperialism; its final bid for existence, as
> monopoly-capitalism or imperialism is the last stage of capitalism.
> ([1965](#index.xhtml_CIT0042){.biblioref role="doc-biblioref"
> xml-rid="CIT0042"}, 31)
> :::

Thus, like Amin, Nkrumah understood the task of economic development in
the periphery as a struggle against "the empire of finance capital"
(35--36). Unlike Amin, Nkrumah ([1965](#index.xhtml_CIT0042){.biblioref
role="doc-biblioref" xml-rid="CIT0042"}, 32) adopted a working
relationship with this empire, arguing that "it is impossible for any of
us to avoid dealing with monopoly in some form or another". He believed
that with international solidarity, non-aligned state elites could
"maintain the integrity of our financial institutions" and "leave
ourselves room to manoeuvre away" from neo-colonialism (Nkrumah
[1965](#index.xhtml_CIT0042){.biblioref role="doc-biblioref"
xml-rid="CIT0042"}, 32). Here, his focus was on pan-Africanism, but he
also supported "a strengthening of the Afro-Asian Solidarity
Organisation and the spirit of Bandung", as well as solidarity "on an
increasingly formal basis" with "our Latin American brothers" (Nkrumah
[1965](#index.xhtml_CIT0042){.biblioref role="doc-biblioref"
xml-rid="CIT0042"}, 253--254). Thus, whereas Amin criticised the NIEO's
common-front strategy, Nkrumah helped create it. He argued that newly
independent states must act "in a combination that will give strength to
our bargaining power and eliminate so many of the duplications that give
greater force and greater advantage to the imperialists and their
strategy of neo-colonialism" (Nkrumah
[1965](#index.xhtml_CIT0042){.biblioref role="doc-biblioref"
xml-rid="CIT0042"}, 30--31).

reforms that would become key pillars of the NIEO. Besides calling to

Nkrumah did not believe these reforms would succeed in isolation, but
thought they would be useful. If implemented, they would mitigate the
worst effects of imperialism, boost economic development in the
periphery, and heighten the contradiction between capital and labour in
the imperial core (Nkrumah [1965](#index.xhtml_CIT0042){.biblioref
role="doc-biblioref" xml-rid="CIT0042"}, 255--256). Lenin ([\[1917\]
2008](#index.xhtml_CIT0034){.biblioref role="doc-biblioref"
xml-rid="CIT0034"}) had argued that monopolistic "superprofits" allowed
imperialists to "bribe the labour leaders and the upper stratum of the
labour aristocracy". Nkrumah built on this directly, reasoning that any
mitigation of superprofits would heighten class conflict in the core:

> ::: {role="paragraph"}
> When Africa becomes economically free and politically united, the
> monopolists will come face to face with their own working class in
> their own countries, and a new struggle will arise within which the
> liquidation and collapse of imperialism will be complete.
> ([1965](#index.xhtml_CIT0042){.biblioref role="doc-biblioref"
> xml-rid="CIT0042"}, 255--256)
> :::

Of course, Nkrumah never imagined that this would be possible solely
with NIEO-style reforms. Nor did he imagine that they would be won
through diplomatic consensus (Getachew
[2019](#index.xhtml_CIT0021){.biblioref role="doc-biblioref"
xml-rid="CIT0021"}, 149--150). Within his imaginary, NIEO-style reforms
would damage the interests of imperialist elites. As such, Nkrumah
focused on building non-aligned coalitions, and regional ordering, like
his proposed "All-African Union Government" (Getachew
[2019](#index.xhtml_CIT0021){.biblioref role="doc-biblioref"
xml-rid="CIT0021"}, 102; Nkrumah [1965](#index.xhtml_CIT0042){.biblioref
role="doc-biblioref" xml-rid="CIT0042"}, 35--36). This was justified by
an implicit counterfactual logic, or strategic imaginary. For if
NIEO-style reforms would assist economic development in the periphery
while heightening class contradictions in the imperial core, then there
was little chance of imperialist concessions. Instead, non-aligned
elites would have to create NIEO-style reforms and institutions
themselves. Importantly, this aspect of Nkrumah's *Neo-colonialism*
isn't found in the NIEO's founding declarations. These claimed that the
NIEO would be just as beneficial to the core as to the periphery.
Nkrumah's strategic imaginary should be understood as operating beneath
the surface of these formal, diplomatic documents. Indeed, his strategy
of collective independence was a core part of the Non-Aligned Movement,
and of what the NIEO's advocates came to call "collective self reliance"
(Gwin \[[1977](#index.xhtml_CIT0025){.biblioref role="doc-biblioref"
xml-rid="CIT0025"}\] [2019](#index.xhtml_CIT0025){.biblioref

collective independence that had underlined the NIEO's initial moment of
possibility.

## Raúl Prebisch's strategy of a liberal consensus

::: {role="paragraph"}
Whereas Nkrumah imagined NIEO-style reforms as useful for creating
global socialism, Prebisch believed they would help create a global
capitalism that functioned as it was already supposed to. As his report
as the founding Secretary General of UNCTAD made clear, Prebisch sought
to achieve this by reforming the post-WWII Bretton Woods system from
within. Take, for example, his criticism of the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade (GATT), the precursor to the World Trade Organisation
(WTO). Prebisch didn't oppose its core goal of promoting free trade, but
its historical blindness. It ignored the fact that the benefits of free
trade did not apply between "the industrially advanced and the
developing countries" (Bockman [2015](#index.xhtml_CIT0007){.biblioref
role="doc-biblioref" xml-rid="CIT0007"}, 115; Prebisch
[1964](#index.xhtml_CIT0048){.biblioref role="doc-biblioref"
xml-rid="CIT0048"}, 29). For, as Prebisch established alongside Hans
Singer, exports from the periphery showed a long-term tendency to
decline relative to their industrial imports (Toye and Toye
[2003](#index.xhtml_CIT0058){.biblioref role="doc-biblioref"
xml-rid="CIT0058"}). Thus, if the GATT's rules and norms were applied
equally between the core and periphery, they would constrain, rather
than help, economic development (Prebisch
[1964](#index.xhtml_CIT0048){.biblioref role="doc-biblioref"
xml-rid="CIT0048"}). To amend this, Prebisch sought to unify the newly
formed G77 behind a set of reforms aimed at supporting peripheral
industrialisation (Dosman [2008](#index.xhtml_CIT0017){.biblioref
role="doc-biblioref" xml-rid="CIT0017"}, 394--395). These measures
included a real transfer of wealth from the core to the periphery and
the establishment of commodity agreements to regulate and increase the
price of peripheral exports. Like Nkrumah, Prebisch never believed that
these reforms would be sufficient. He made this point with a
counterfactual, imagining that:

> ::: {role="paragraph"}
> If the peripheral countries manage to secure a larger share for their
> primary exports in the consumption of the industrial countries, this,
> together with the transfer of income from the latter countries to the
> former to offset the effects of the deterioration in the terms of
> trade, will help to narrow the trade gap but will not in itself be
> enough to close it. (Prebisch [1964](#index.xhtml_CIT0048){.biblioref
> role="doc-biblioref" xml-rid="CIT0048"}, 20)
> :::

What's more, none of Prebisch's proposed reforms were intended to be
permanent ([1964](#index.xhtml_CIT0048){.biblioref role="doc-biblioref"
xml-rid="CIT0048"}, 31). As peripheral industrialisation grew, the
"disparity" with the core "can be levelled out gradually" (Prebisch
[1964](#index.xhtml_CIT0048){.biblioref role="doc-biblioref"
xml-rid="CIT0048"}, 31). Indeed, Prebisch wrote that: "With an effort of
the imagination it is possible to visualise a situation of dynamic
equilibrium in the distant future in which \[the declining terms of
trade\] disappears as a result of the world-wide process of
industrialization" (Prebisch [1964](#index.xhtml_CIT0048){.biblioref
role="doc-biblioref" xml-rid="CIT0048"}, 15).
:::

::: {role="paragraph"}
Here lies the biggest difference between Prebisch and Nkrumah. For
Prebisch, NIEO-style reforms would not significantly threaten the
profits of state elites from the global North. For these were not
radical nor permanent reforms, and would have the effect of increasing
economic development in both the core and periphery. This had important
strategic implications. If true, the G77 could create global reforms to
world order through "joint responsibilities, common objectives, and
convergent measures" (Prebisch [1964](#index.xhtml_CIT0048){.biblioref
role="doc-biblioref" xml-rid="CIT0048"}, 183). This strategic imaginary
was a fundamental part the NIEO's founding declarations, which claimed
that it would help both North and South alike (UN
[1974a](#index.xhtml_CIT0059){.biblioref role="doc-biblioref"
xml-rid="CIT0059"}). It also shaped the G77's legal strategy, which
sought to reform the United Nations from within, on the basis of global
consensus (Bedjaoui [1979](#index.xhtml_CIT0003){.biblioref
role="doc-biblioref" xml-rid="CIT0003"}, 196--197). It is this moderate
tendency that scholars have used to describe the NIEO as an essentially
"Keynesian liberal" project (Murphy
[2005](#index.xhtml_CIT0039){.biblioref role="doc-biblioref"
xml-rid="CIT0039"}, 12; see also Helleiner
[2016](#index.xhtml_CIT0028){.biblioref role="doc-biblioref"

## Decision-making: the strategic imaginaries in practice

::: {role="paragraph"}
So far, this article has shown that Nkrumah and Prebisch contributed
conflicting visions of what would happen if NIEO-style reforms were
implemented. The counterfactual logic underlying these imaginaries had a
direct bearing on the strategies each leader helped create. The more
radical strategy of collective independence was promoted within the NAM,
which Nkrumah helped found (Gwin
\[[1977](#index.xhtml_CIT0025){.biblioref role="doc-biblioref"
xml-rid="CIT0025"}\] [2019](#index.xhtml_CIT0025){.biblioref
role="doc-biblioref" xml-rid="CIT0025"}; Murphy
\[[1984](#index.xhtml_CIT0038){.biblioref role="doc-biblioref"
xml-rid="CIT0038"}\] [2019](#index.xhtml_CIT0038){.biblioref
role="doc-biblioref" xml-rid="CIT0038"}; Sauvant
[2014](#index.xhtml_CIT0052){.biblioref role="doc-biblioref"
xml-rid="CIT0052"}, 5). The more moderate strategy of seeking a global
consensus was promoted within UNCTAD and the G77, which Prebisch had
helped lead (Prebisch [1964](#index.xhtml_CIT0048){.biblioref
role="doc-biblioref" xml-rid="CIT0048"}, 183; Thomas
[1985](#index.xhtml_CIT0056){.biblioref role="doc-biblioref"
xml-rid="CIT0056"}, 126--127). In this section, I show how these
strategies related to the rise and decline of the original NIEO. That
means asking how, in key turning points, G77 elites chose between the
strategies of global consensus and collective, non-aligned independence.
I argue that the non-aligned common front was originally empowered by a
synthesis of both strategies. Initially, in late 1973, Western elites
used the petrodollar crisis as a pretext to end the IMF's "radical"
attempt at creating "a quantum jump into a new \[monetary\] system" (IMF
[1972](#index.xhtml_CIT0030){.biblioref role="doc-biblioref"
xml-rid="CIT0030"}, 4; De Vries and Garritsen
[1985](#index.xhtml_CIT0064){.biblioref role="doc-biblioref"
xml-rid="CIT0064"}, 240--242). In response, Algerian president Houari
Boumédiène leveraged OPEC's new power to call for the Sixth Special
Session, where decisions would be made on all matters of global
development (Gwin \[[1977](#index.xhtml_CIT0025){.biblioref
role="doc-biblioref" xml-rid="CIT0025"}\]
[2019](#index.xhtml_CIT0025){.biblioref role="doc-biblioref"

xml-rid="CIT0052"}, 5; Thomas [1985](#index.xhtml_CIT0056){.biblioref
role="doc-biblioref" xml-rid="CIT0056"}, 128--129). In this way, the
strategy of collective independence, via the NAM and OPEC, was used to
empower the strategy of reaching a global consensus within the UN
General Assembly (UNGA [1974a](#index.xhtml_CIT0061){.biblioref
role="doc-biblioref" xml-rid="CIT0061"},
[1974b](#index.xhtml_CIT0060){.biblioref role="doc-biblioref"
xml-rid="CIT0060"}).
:::

::: {role="paragraph"}
This strategic synthesis, which empowered the NIEO's initial moment of
possibility, peaked at the Seventh Special Session in September 1975. At
this time, the world economic crisis had been marked by continued
uncertainty, and a decline in the value of the recently floated
US-dollar. This reduced the value of OPEC's petrodollar surpluses, and
made OPEC's ([1975](#index.xhtml_CIT0043){.biblioref
role="doc-biblioref" xml-rid="CIT0043"}) *Solemn Declaration* all the
more believable. In it, OPEC heads of state explicitly tied their oil
and financial power to the goal of a NIEO. This had an obvious effect.
In the lead up to the Seventh Special Session, CIA analysts feared what
they called "the radicals, led by Algeria" (CIA
[1975](#index.xhtml_CIT0010){.biblioref role="doc-biblioref"
xml-rid="CIT0010"}). Because the radicals wanted "a big transfer of
resources" and "have a lot of power", the CIA argued that a "compromise
may need to be struck in regards to commodities". This accords with
Kissinger's strategy at the Special Session, which projected what
appeared like a genuine willingness to compromise (Dietrich
[2017](#index.xhtml_CIT0016){.biblioref role="doc-biblioref"
xml-rid="CIT0016"}, 284--289; Gosovic and Ruggie
[1976](#index.xhtml_CIT0024){.biblioref role="doc-biblioref"

xml-rid="CIT0025"}; Sargent [2015](#index.xhtml_CIT0050){.biblioref
role="doc-biblioref" xml-rid="CIT0050"}). However, by the end of the
Paris Conference on International Economic Cooperation (CIEC) in 1977,
the exchange rate of the US-dollar seemed to have stabilised. As such,
OPEC's capital appeared relatively more stable within a US-led order,
and the option of investing in the NIEO became relatively riskier
(Nicholls [2019](#index.xhtml_CIT0041){.biblioref role="doc-biblioref"
xml-rid="CIT0041"}, 146--149). Through massive increases in US arms
sales, Iran and Saudi Arabia chose instead to strengthen ties with
imperialism (Brzoska and Ohlson [1987](#index.xhtml_CIT0008){.biblioref
role="doc-biblioref" xml-rid="CIT0008"}, 343--348; Dietrich

[2014](#index.xhtml_CIT0066){.biblioref role="doc-biblioref"
xml-rid="CIT0066"}). As a result, US negotiators dropped their apparent
willingness to compromise. Indeed, at the CIEC, they dismissed all
concerns about the growing debt crisis, claiming that it would fix
itself (UNA [1976](#index.xhtml_CIT0059){.biblioref role="doc-biblioref"
xml-rid="CIT0059"}; Nicholls [2019](#index.xhtml_CIT0041){.biblioref
role="doc-biblioref" xml-rid="CIT0041"}, 150--151). With the conference
ending in failure, G77 solidarity collapsed.
:::

::: {role="paragraph"}
The rise and decline of this original strategic synthesis raises two
counterfactual questions. First, as Samir Amin considered in 1982, is
the question of unpredictable economic contingencies. What if the
economic crisis had deepened, from 1975 to 1977, rather than apparently
stabilising? Would key OPEC elites have then been more likely to finance
experiments in the NIEO, like UNCTAD's proposed Common Fund? Even if the
Common Fund failed to underlie a new wave of commodity price agreements,
it seems likely that significant OPEC investment would have boosted G77
solidarity, for it would have legitimised the strategic synthesis that
had made the NIEO project possible in the first place. Secondly, if G77
solidarity had been strengthened before the debt crisis, could the group
have formed a debtors' cartel, as proposed by Cuba (Prashad
[2007](#index.xhtml_CIT0046){.biblioref role="doc-biblioref"
xml-rid="CIT0046"}, 214--219)? The counterfactual of a debtors' cartel
is tantalising because of how close the world economic crisis came, even
without a cartel, to collapsing the US financial system (Corbridge
[1993](#index.xhtml_CIT0012){.biblioref role="doc-biblioref"
xml-rid="CIT0012"}, 44--45; Helleiner
[1996](#index.xhtml_CIT0027){.biblioref role="doc-biblioref"
xml-rid="CIT0027"}, 176; Mazower [2013](#index.xhtml_CIT0035){.biblioref
role="doc-biblioref" xml-rid="CIT0035"}, 351). To avoid a collapse, US
state and financial elites employed their own strategy of collective
independence, wielding the full weight of their monopoly finance capital
to quash economic development in South America and Africa for over a
decade (Bazbauers and Engel [2021](#index.xhtml_CIT0002){.biblioref
role="doc-biblioref" xml-rid="CIT0002"}; Easterly
[2001](#index.xhtml_CIT0018){.biblioref role="doc-biblioref"
xml-rid="CIT0018"}; Harvey [2005](#index.xhtml_CIT0026){.biblioref
role="doc-biblioref" xml-rid="CIT0026"}, 29; Prashad
[2014](#index.xhtml_CIT0047){.biblioref role="doc-biblioref"
xml-rid="CIT0047"}, 5--7; Stewart
[2012](#index.xhtml_CIT0054){.biblioref role="doc-biblioref"
xml-rid="CIT0054"}, 88, 92; Thomas
[1985](#index.xhtml_CIT0056){.biblioref role="doc-biblioref"
xml-rid="CIT0056"}, 149). With a debtors' cartel, things might have
happened differently. By risking a systemic collapse of the
still-bourgeoning neo-liberal world disorder, a debtors' cartel could
have forced the North--South dialogue back to the future of the early
1970s, when most global elites still supported a reformed Bretton Woods
(De Vries and Garritsen [1985](#index.xhtml_CIT0064){.biblioref
role="doc-biblioref" xml-rid="CIT0064"}, 242--243, 255--256). Thus,
again, the strategic synthesis between the NIEO's more radical,
non-aligned strategy, and its more moderate, consensus-seeking strategy,
would have helped decide the future of world order and global
development.
:::

::: {role="paragraph"}
Of course, such counterfactual scenarios are imaginary, so can't be
tested with historical research. Still, as C.L.R. James argued, the
point of analysing historical decision-making is not just to understand
what actually could have been decided, but to understand what "should"
have been (\[[1938](#index.xhtml_CIT0031){.biblioref
role="doc-biblioref" xml-rid="CIT0031"}\]1989, 282). It is only through
such questions that consciousness can use the past to guide
decision-making in the present. This is made clear in the lead up to the
Progressive International's ([2024](#index.xhtml_CIT0045){.biblioref
role="doc-biblioref" xml-rid="CIT0045"}) Havana Congress, when it asked:
"Should we form a club of debtor nations to navigate the crisis of
sovereign debt?" This fits a more general tendency within the movement
towards the NIEO's Nkrumahist strategic tradition. By acknowledging that
the original NIEO "was won through the exercise of collective power in
the coordinated production of petroleum", the PI declares that its own
"vision today can only be realized through the collective action of the
South". To explore such strategic possibilities, Michael Galant
([2024](#index.xhtml_CIT0020){.biblioref role="doc-biblioref"
xml-rid="CIT0020"}) considered the history of the original NIEO, and
concluded that "even a united negotiating front is only as strong as its
underlying balance of power". For Galant, a member of the PI's Executive
Committee, the implication is that the movement must create "South-South
collective action" in the form of a "new critical minerals cartel" and a
"club of debtor nations". As these statements make clear, the
Progressive International's current attempts at renovating the NIEO are
based on a reconsideration of the exact strategies that were sorely
missed during the demise of the original. The PI knows that it is not
enough to simply seek a global consensus.
:::

::: {role="paragraph"}
Still, the PI has not, for this reason, ignored the NIEO's more
Prebischian goals and strategies. Its *Havana Declaration* (2023) calls
for a global consensus, or a "Planetary Bloc" supported by "all peoples
and nations". Perhaps most interesting, however, is the fact that some
of the PI's leaders are drawing -- even if unwittingly -- on parts of
Samir Amin's critique of the NIEO. Within the eclectic imaginaries of
Yanis Varoufakis, the historical echoes of both Prebisch and Amin can be
heard in a new strategic synthesis. Like Amin's critique of
"sub-imperialism" within the G77, Varoufakis
([2023](#index.xhtml_CIT0062){.biblioref role="doc-biblioref"
xml-rid="CIT0062"}) has argued the PI "must not repeat the mistake" of
relying on "the elites of the Global South". He made this point with a
counterfactual, arguing that: "Our New Non-Aligned Movement will fail if
we give it a narrow role of bringing together the G77 and the BRICS in
opposition to the West". Varoufakis also reflects the NIEO's more
moderate goals, even as Prebisch is sidelined for "Green Keynesianism"
(see also Schwartz [2023](#index.xhtml_CIT0053){.biblioref
role="doc-biblioref" xml-rid="CIT0053"}). While believing, like
Prebisch, that such reforms would address capitalist crises, Varoufakis
is sceptical that the capitalist class will support "the very road that
leads to its own salvation". Instead, he calls for "Genuine democracy"
that will "be practised in the citizens' and the workers' assemblies;
not behind closed doors where secretive oligarchs gather". This is
indicative of a key trend within the PI's "renovation" of the NIEO. In
this new, still somewhat implicit strategy, the PI is attempting to
empower an NIEO from below, via its movement of movements, or grass
roots social forces.

## Conclusion

::: {role="paragraph"}
By focusing on the counterfactual logic used by Amin, Nkrumah, and
Prebisch, this article traced the broad strategies that underlined the
original NIEO, and which continue to shape the PI's efforts to
"renovate" the project. This is important for both development studies
and the development industry, which have largely assumed that "there is
no alternative" to neo-liberal globalisation. The history of the
original NIEO, and the work of the PI, challenges these assumptions, for
both projects reflect real alternatives, or different strategic options.
The original NIEO failed to meet its stated objectives, but in many
ways, it succeeded. It succeeded in creating a global solidarity which
possessed powerful decision-making options. As such, key questions
remain about what would have happened if its power had been used
differently. As the NIEO was undermined during a global debt crisis, the
PI reconsiders the possibilities of a debtors' cartel. Thus, just like
with the original NIEO, the PI hopes to use collective independence to
empower global reforms built on consensus. If chosen on a sufficiently
global scale, during an acute global crisis, such strategic syntheses
might again shape the future of global development. They might again
create possibilities for the structural transformation of
neo-colonialism, the highest stage of monopoly capitalism.
