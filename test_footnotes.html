<h1>Footnote Test Document</h1>

<p>This is the first paragraph with a reference to a standard footnote.[^1] It tests the Markdown style.</p>

<p>Here is another paragraph with a numeric footnote that might come from a word processor.<sup>2</sup> We will look for this style, too.</p>

<p>You can also use named footnotes, which is very useful for long documents.[^alpha] This paragraph also contains a marker that has no definition and should be ignored.[^missing]</p>

<p>[^1]: This is the content of the first footnote. It explains the first point in more detail.</p>
<p>[^alpha]: This is the content of the named footnote.</p>
<p>3. This is a red herring, a numbered list item that is NOT a footnote definition.</p>
<p>1. This is the content for the very first footnote, but it's a different style.</p>
<p>2. This is the content of the second, numeric-style footnote.</p>
